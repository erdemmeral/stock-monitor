Positive Points Complete Solaria Inc ( NASDAQ:CSLR ) successfully integrated SunPower assets, reducing headcount significantly from 3,499 to 140 employees, with a target of 980. The company achieved a substantial revenue increase from $5 million to $80 million in Q4 2024, demonstrating strong growth. Operating expenses were reduced from $94 million in Q3 to $35 million in Q4, indicating effective cost management. Complete Solaria Inc ( NASDAQ:CSLR ) forecasts revenue growth in the next quarter, projecting $82 million despite typical seasonal downturns in the solar industry. The company is on track to achieve operating income break-even in Q1 2025, with a forecasted non-GAAP operating income of $800,000. Negative Points The financial results discussed are preliminary and unaudited, with a full audit delayed until mid-March due to complexities in merging financials. Complete Solaria Inc ( NASDAQ:CSLR ) reported a non-GAAP loss of $5.94 million in Q4 2024, highlighting ongoing financial challenges. The dealer division underperformed, contributing significantly to the reduction from the initial $100 million revenue target to $80 million. The company is still facing challenges with legacy costs, including rent and software expenses, which need further reduction. There is a risk associated with achieving the forecasted operating income break-even, as the margin is fragile and could be impacted by unforeseen issues. Q & A Highlights Q : How is the portfolio churn trending in the new homes business, and what's the plan to grow that business? A : T.J. Rodgers, Executive Chairman of the Board, explained that the new homes business is currently the more profitable of their two divisions. Although revenues are flat due to past cancellations, they are receiving new orders and expect growth by the end of the year, having survived the bankruptcy challenges. Story Continues Q : How will CSLR effectively leverage the SunPower brand? Do you have any new plans? A : T.J. Rodgers stated that they plan to utilize the SunPower name, which they successfully defended in court. They aim to integrate the brand into their operations, particularly in the home division and Blue Raven. Q : Are there any more commercial deals in the pipeline, and how do you view that business? A : T.J. Rodgers mentioned their existing contracts with Starbucks, highlighting a solar awning project. While they see potential in light commercial projects, the focus remains on their two main divisions, with possible future acquisitions to expand in this area. Q : Can you discuss incremental cost reduction efforts and how much more should the market expect on that front? A : T.J. Rodgers noted that significant cost reductions have already been achieved, with further reductions expected as they eliminate unnecessary expenses like rent and software. The heavy lifting in cost-cutting is largely complete. Q : What are the risks to achieving operating income break-even in the first quarter of 2025? A : T.J. Rodgers acknowledged the risk of not achieving break-even, noting their planned profit margin is slim. However, he expressed confidence that they are more likely to meet this target, which would be a significant milestone. Q : What is your appetite for additional acquisitions, and would targets expand current positions or offerings? A : T.J. Rodgers is open to acquisitions that offer solid potential and good practices. He emphasized looking for companies with strong fundamentals rather than high-flying ventures, considering both expansion and new capabilities. Q : Can you discuss the strategy and outlook for the dealer division? A : T.J. Rodgers explained that they decided to shrink the dealer division due to its instability and high costs. They are focusing on more stable and profitable segments, like their Blue Raven division, which handles its own sales. Q : How do you see yourself differentiated versus your peers in the next 6 to 12 months? A : T.J. Rodgers highlighted their financial stability and strong consumer ratings as key differentiators. They plan to focus on technology and acquisitions to further enhance their competitive edge. Q : Can you provide any timing on when your name change to SunPower might occur? A : T.J. Rodgers acknowledged the value of the SunPower name but noted internal challenges due to mixed perceptions of the brand. They are working on integrating the name effectively.

Solar, Inc. Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 4:00 PM 14 min read In This Article: CSLR -2.73% CSLRW -6.70% Complete Solar, Inc. OREM, Utah, Jan. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Complete Solaria, Inc. d/b/a Complete Solar (\u201cComplete Solar\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (Nasdaq: CSLR), a solar technology, services, and installation company, today will present its preliminary unaudited Q4\u201924 results via webcast at 2:00pm ET. Interested parties may access the webcast by registering here or by visiting the Events page within the IR section of the company website: investors.completesolar.com/news-events/events . Complete Solar Chairman and CEO, T.J. Rodgers commented, \u201cOur Q4\u201924 results are subject to a full-year audit, which is currently in progress and involves historical SunPower financials, a complication that is forecasted to delay our audited Q4\u201924 results into mid-March. By that time, I want to be talking to investors about Q2\u201925, only two weeks away, not analyzing 2024 history. That\u2019s why we are providing this preliminary , unaudited report which focuses on just Q4\u201924 and our forecast for Q1\u201925. The risk of this decision is that the audit process may change some of the results, but probably not revenue, and certainly not the Q1\u201925 forecast. We have a 57-person finance group comprised of people from two public companies that I trust to report one quarter properly. The Q1\u201925 forecast is mine. Rodgers added, \u201cWe will give GAAP and non-GAAP results for those quarters with commentary focusing on the non-GAAP results, unless otherwise stated. My philosophy is that \u201cnon-GAAP\u201d results should be as close to GAAP results as possible, but without 1) stock earnings charges added onto the dilution impact of share count we already report, 2) amortization of intangible assets, and 3) charges for special one-time events, both negative and positive.\u201d Summary of CSLR\u2019s Q4\u201924 Accomplishments In our November 13 Third Quarter Report, we presented an operating plan for Complete Solar predicated on our successful $45 million acquisition of business unit assets from SunPower to form a Complete Solar \u201cNewCo\u201d (herein called CSLR). This plan called for two big accomplishments that have now been achieved: 1) that the old-CSLR, a small solar company with little cash and only $5.5 million of prior-quarter revenue, would acquire and integrate assets of the SunPower corporation, which was founded in 1985 and about 10 times bigger than old-CSLR, and 2) that, as we wrote in our Third Quarter Report, \u201cour revenue would be $80 million in Q4\u201924,\u201d the quarter after the asset purchase. This report presents Q4\u201924 combined company results on a GAAP-compliant basis and certain non-GAAP results and our Q1\u201925 forecast. The narrative is based on the non-GAAP financial results, unless otherwise noted: Story Continues The SunPower Integration is substantially complete . On the last day of Q3\u201924, September 30, we closed the acquisition, six days after a Delaware bankruptcy court approved our asset purchase of three SunPower business units, which have now been substantially integrated (including their MRP systems) into CSLR as its two sole operating divisions, New Homes and Blue Raven Solar. That asset integration raised our headcount from 109 to 1,341 on September 30. Our original target of 1,225 was achieved in December, as shown on the included headcount chart. We raised $80 million on September 24 to fund the $45 million SunPower asset purchase price plus the expected added operating capital required to get to profitability. Our $81.1 million Q4 revenue beat expectations . CSLR\u2019s consolidated revenue for Q4\u201924 jumped to $81.1 million, up 14.7 times vs. old-CSLR\u2019s $5.5 million third quarter revenue on a standalone basis, and beat the $80 million revenue forecasted in our Third Quarter Report. New Divisional EVP/GMs are in place . We announced the promotion of Blue Raven\u2019s Dan Myers as the EVP and GM of the New Homes Division on October 15, 2024 ( here ). And one month ago, we hired veteran operations manager Steve Erickson, who was promoted six times at three Salt Lake \u201cSolar Valley\u201d companies since 2011, to be the EVP and GM of the Blue Raven Solar Division. We are forecasting revenue growth next quarter . Despite the typical industry seasonality that reduces solar industry revenue by 5%-14% in the Q1 winter quarter, we are forecasting modest quarter-on-quarter revenue growth to $82.0 million in Q1\u201925. The Company is almost at its \u201c fighting weight .\u201d The combined headcount of the two companies started at 3,499 on October 1 and was reduced by 67% to 1,140 by the end of Q4\u201924, as shown in the embedded org chart. Our final headcount target for the combined company is 980. Our operating expense has been cut by a factor of two . The headcount reduction led to a total non-GAAP operating expense reduction from $94.0 in Q3\u201924 million for the added expenses of the two companies to $35.7 million in Q4\u201924 for the combined and cost-reduced company. The operating expenses less sales commissions were $84.0 million in Q3\u201924, down to $19.8 million in Q4\u201924, a 4x reduction. Our forecast is to drop operating expense less commissions by another 30% in Q1\u201925. We are forecasting operating income breakeven in Q1\u201925 . Given our current backlog and cost-cutting plan, we are forecasting non-GAAP operating income at breakeven in Q1\u201925. Our cash balance will grow . We finished Q4\u201924 with $13.3 million in cash, our lowest quarter since raising the $80 million in funding. We plan to grow cash from operations during 2025. Fellow Shareholders: Our revenue, earnings and cashflow for the stand-alone old-CSLR (Q1-Q3) and the post-merger CSLR (Q4), preliminary and unaudited, are given below showing identical Q4\u201924 GAAP and non-GAAP results, except for GAAP operating income, which still contains charges from merger write-offs: GAAP to Non GAAP Table Page 3 The Noah\u2019s Ark Model Our primary cost reductions in Q4\u201924 were achieved by reducing headcount in both companies: CSLR Total Headcount By Work Week CAPTION NEEDED So far, we have reduced our headcount from 3,499 to 1,140 employees, using the Noah\u2019s Ark model in which the 65-employee old-CSLR made employment offers to only 1,219 SunPower and Blue Raven Solar employees to get them \u201con the Ark\u201d that, we believe, will shelter them from the flood of high interest rates that has already has put over 70 solar companies out of business. Revenue Projection When we were raising the $80 million in Q4\u201924 for the merger, the first five-quarter plan presented to investors called for $100 million in revenue in Q4\u201924, and an operating loss of $1.0 million, followed by breakeven operating income in Q2\u201925. After the backlog uncertainty caused by order cancellations due to the SPWR bankruptcy, we revised our post-integration Q4\u201924 revenue estimate to $80 million from $100 million in our November 13 Third Quarter Report \u2013 and also gave an improved breakeven revenue forecast of $80 million to our shareholders, which, in turn, reduced the allowable number of employees CSLR would support from 1,225 to 980. Actual 510-foot Oak Noah\u2019s Ark Model \u2013 Williamsburg, KY The Ark The Ark merger theory is actually nothing but a typical Silicon Valley startup plan in disguise. Instead of a big company in trouble asking for and getting too much money (SunPower asked for $750 million) \u2013 and then being burdened for years with losses and layoffs from debt, the Ark Theory asserts, \u201cYour old company has great assets. Get venture funding for those assets (in our case, $80 million) and build a new organization that can make a profit with what you\u2019ve got.\u201d Org Chart Since this org chart was shown last quarter, we have merged the Dealer business unit into the Blue Raven business unit and the O&M (Operations and Maintenance to support our customers) into our Quality Group, with a new Senior VP of quality, Surinder Bedi, who headed Advanced Product Quality at Lucid Motors. Other new executives include Chaise Sweat, our General Counsel from ADT Solar, and Venki Sundaresan, our VP of IT, who ran IT groups at Cypress Semiconductor and Enphase. This Friday, January 24, 2025, at our Orem, Utah HQ, we will present this report to over 1,000 employees and our board. We will also cover the details of our 2025 Rev. 6 Annual Operating Plan which currently shows operating income profitability in 2025. Complete Solar CEO, T.J. Rodgers said, \u201cThe board honored our fourth quarter performance with a modest $1.14 million bonus (1.4% of revenue) \u2013 even in a loss quarter, which is rare. Management chose to give the bonus money to all hands equally to recognize that the rank-and-file employees made the quarter for us. The management team holds significant restricted stock and will get rewarded by the market when they 'meet and beat the street,' by producing a series of quarters that impresses Wall Street. Rodgers continued, \u201cOur $81.1 million revenue last quarter re-defined our Company with an annualized revenue of $324 million and a $5.94 million quarterly loss that will not survive in 2025 , as Muhammad Ali might have said. Rodgers concluded, \u201cWe would like to thank our shareholders for funding our company and giving us the opportunity to re-build an iconic solar company.\u201d Helios Prototype The NASA Helios airplane had 14 electric motors that used SunPower all-black high-efficiency cells to take off and land on its own power. In 2001, it set an all-time altitude record of 96,863 feet, which still stands. The F-15 Eagle, a mach 2.5 fighter, capable of accelerating while climbing vertically, has a service ceiling of 72,000 feet.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in\u00a0the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), Complete Solar provides an additional financial metrics in this press release that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP (\"non-GAAP\"). Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, are useful measures of operating performance because the non-GAAP financial measure does not include the impact of items that management does not consider indicative of Complete Solar\u2019s operating performance, such as amortization of goodwill and expensing employee stock options in addition to accounting for their dilutive effect, which facilitates the analysis of the company\u2019s core operating results across reporting periods. The non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of Complete Solar\u2019s GAAP financial results and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, Complete Solar\u2019s financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. Descriptions of and reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are included in the financial table above and related footnotes. We encourage investors to carefully consider our preliminary results under GAAP, as well as our preliminary non-GAAP information and the reconciliations between these presentations, to more fully understand our business. Non-GAAP financial measures are reported in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

And Steve Erickson, our EVP GM of the Blue Raven Division, by voice only. I am here to Novik in Silicon Valley, and I've got one channel and that's me and I've got voice for them. Dan. Say hello, so I can check your voice. Unidentified Participant Hello. TJ? T.J. Rodgers Oh my God. Okay. My, my connection is a cell phone. All right, good luck. Okay, this is the report we sent out. I will refer to certain parts of it. Today we're going to talk about Q4 24 which is a month behind us. Unfortunately, it is subject to a full year audit, which is currently in progress and that audit is currently hampered by the fact that we have to recreate as if merged. Financials for SunPower and some part doesn't have complete financials. So that may take us till mid-March. Hence, I'm not waiting till mid-March to talk about 2024. So, I call this meeting today that puts me here in Silicon Valley because I got other board meetings here. I apologize for that because this is a preliminary report and it's unaudited for the reasons I just gave, we're only going to talk about what I think you want to know now, which is, how did we do last quarter and here we think we're going in the current quarter and that's what all we're going to do today. First of all, accomplishments, we had a great quarter in our last record third quarter, report to you, we gave you a plan for complete solar and that plan was aggressive. It was predicated on a successful $45 million acquisition of business unit assets from SunPower to form a new company. And the plan had two big accomplishments that were required in it. One that the little company, a $5.5 million company would acquire a much bigger company, the Sun Park Corporation, which has been around for almost 40 years and it's about 10 times bigger than us. That was one assumption achieved. And the second assumption in our plan that we wrote in our third quarter report, our revenue would be 80 million in Q424. That is a revenue would jump from 5 million to 80 million in one quarter. This is a slide I showed to investors. I talked about all complete Solaria, the trouble we had with private equity, we originally marketed $100 million quarter as a likely quarter that turned to be an $80 million quarter which we announced on 1,113. And I was worried about taking a jump from here to here as opposed to a jump from here to here until I watched your response to it and your response was right here. There's November 12th and your response was favourable. You'll take a solid $80 million and that's where we ended up. I would like to talk about our accomplishments for the quarter. I've got a series of bullets on that and a few slides to illustrate it. First of all, the SunPower integration is substantially complete. We're together, we're organized together, we are starting to, we've already got down to our head count. This is a graph by work week, going back to the beginning of October. So, there's the fourth quarter we're reporting right there. We started out when we first agreed to merge with the 3,499 employees. Within three weeks, we were down to 416 in our first storage chart and then a week later, two weeks later, down to 257. So, this is about what the company needed. We have some people come in on post-merger on day one, we work that number down. We got the number down to 1165 and we thought we were there and then you notice here the number went up and this is when we started discovering employees that let's just say the two companies didn't count very well. And I found 35 Pakistanis that, think I'm their CEO so that comp went back in, and we started working on it again. And as of the end of the quarter, we're down to 140 employees. Our goal is to get to 980. So, I'm claiming major progress from there to there. And I'm saying we're getting close to the goal, and I actually was going to do that. I pointed we've got two new divisional Gross man. GMs in place. EVP GMs Dan Myers. I announced about a month ago he was a star manager from the Blue Raven Systems Division. He was a supply, is a supply chain expert and he took over new homes for us. And then more recently, we got Steve Erickson. Steve is a well-known figure in Salt Lake which is, Solar Valley, the middle of Solar Valley. In his career, he had 12 promotions from three companies between 2011 and 2024 when he came in. He hit the ground running, wrote me a comprehensive memo the very first week he was there explaining what he saw that he liked and did not like, and I advised him to fix the stuff he didn't like and move on. Okay. So, we we've got our, we've got our GMS in place. We are forecasting revenue growth next quarter. As you all know, the solar industry has in the winter quarter has the dip orders go down. People aren't interested in ordering solar when the roofs are covered with ice. And I did some research that number has typically been 5% to 14%. We're going to buck that because we're finally getting our act together and we're going to have a good second quarter and I'm forecasting $82 million up a little bit from the choir prior quarter. Not down. The last point is the company is almost at its fighting rate. I went through that with you showing we're down to 140 employees and we will hit the 980. We need to have; I'll tell you where that number comes from a little bit later. So, here's the same slide. I already showed you showing the actual against the $80 million forecast last quarter in Q4 and the forecast for the quarter were at 82. And I'll just tell you we're confident in that number and I'll show you why. And when I show you the daily revenue charts, we've cut our operating expense by a factor of two. That of course comes from headcount reduction. Our OpEx was an incredible $94 million in the third quarter. That's because we had most of the people from both the companies and a lot of expensive software, $5 million a year for salesforce dotcom, et cetera. We've gone from $94 million in Q3 to $35 million in Q4 for the combined cost reduced company that I showed you the curve for a minute ago. I like to look at operating expenses, less sales commissions. GAAP requires that you call OpEx to be general sales and administrative. And if you have sales commissions, then they go and they go into OpEx. I like to look at the OpEx without commissions because commissions come in as directly with sales and I really care about the fixed expense we've got back in the plant also, in that case, you subtract out the numbers. And in Q3, we were at $84 million again astronomical number. And in Q4 just finished, we had non-GAAP expense of $ 20 million. So, we actually went down from 80 to 20. It's a factor of four reduction and we're planning on dropping another 30% in Q1. That's the 1140 to 980 that I showed you earlier. We're also forecasting that our cash. We are forecasting. This is a big one, income operating income break even in Q1 '25. The words carefully chosen, say given our current backlog and cost cutting plan, we're forecasting non-GAAP operating income at break. Even in Q1 '25 I can tell you that that number is plus $800,000 and it includes all the expenses we know about, but that's a kind of a fragile margin to predict operating income break even. And normally in presentations like this, you give numbers, you're absolutely sure of achieving. In this case, we're going to get real close worst case. And I'm announcing it sort of putting, drawing a line in the sand here. People in the factory listening to what I'm saying, we're going to break even in Q1 '25 and we're going to be positive in cash flow. We raised 80 million bucks for the purpose of buying SunPower for 45 million bucks and having operating expense. Going forward to build a new company. We bottomed out at $13 million of cash left out of the 80 in Q4 and we'll be going up this quarter now the so these are the bullets and now fellow shareholders, the main, the main numbers. I'm going to turn it over to Dan. Let's no, I'm not going to turn it over today and she's getting her cell phone so she can set it, she can put it in the microphone and we're not and she's got a ring on her phone. I we're not going to do that. So I'll give you the numbers again. It's my fault. I call this meeting out of phase with what we wanted to do because of the long audit revenue. Let me do non-GAAP $81.1, our gross margin you notice has been ugly and up and down, our gross margin is 37% and you notice our GAAP gross margin is the same thing. So, we're kind of flushed the ugly out of the gross margin chain. Our operating expenses are $35.7 GAAP and non-GAAP, our operating expenses less commission $19.7, GAAP and Non-GAAP. So, for our non-GAAP loss excluding extraordinary cost which blew up, the GAAP number was 5,940. So, you can say then this is, you see the small company and then there's the new company that's their first quarter. We've now been defined. We're a $324 million company that's losing money and needs not to lose money as quickly as possible. That's, that's our next goal and we got $13 million in the bank, and we expect it to grow. We acquired so far on what I call a Noah's Ark model. Explain that in a minute, I already explained the leaning up process we've gone through and the fact we're not quite yet at our goal. I've mentioned that we are going to grow next quarter and that, that number is conservative. I'm pretty confident in it. Now, what happened was, when we raised money, the $80 million with that plan. And then after we had a flurry of cancellations on the SunPower side because of the bankruptcy, we ended up with the first quarter being $80 million. I'm pretty happy for that and solid. So, we're going to move forward from that number. Now that says, if you look at our model for the company, instead of having 225 employees, we're going to have 980. So, that's the goal we're enforcing at 1,140. We're actually below our first goal and we set a new goal that was more aggressive of head count of 980. To illustrate that to employees, I actually have shown this slide. I will show it again on Friday, the Noal's ark merger theory is actually a typical Silicon Valley startup plan in the skies instead of a big company in trouble asking for and getting too much money. SunPower was trying to raise when I came in $750 million. And of course, what's worse than wanting to raise $750 million? The answer is actually getting it, then you owe interest on it, and it burdens you forever. And so that's not the right way to do it. In my opinion, the art theory which I used once back in Cypress, we did 20 acquisitions in Cypress assert. Your old company has great assets. If I look at what I what I inherited was $80 million it's enough to make the company profitable. Your old company has great assets, get venture funding for those assets. In our case, $80 million and build a new organization that can make profit with what you've got. So, Noa's Ark, which is to protect us during floods and we're having a flood of interest rate problems right now in the financial markets, got smaller and it's now got 980 seats by the way. Believe it or not, this is actually a four-inch-thick oak hull on a 500 ft long, Noah's ark model that's built in Williamsburg, KY to they claim to biblical standards, okay? A little bit more detail on revenue. This is a picture of my daily revenue report. So, the dots are 91 dots a quarter. We came in with a $100 million street number I showed you and we created our beginning of quarter plan, which is the daily plan. For example, you can see the weekends and holidays in here. So, it's a tight well-conceived plan. We took off on the plan and then we got behind right here. We said that we're not going to make the boq beginning of quarter plan. We need another plan. So, we did what we call an end of quarter plan. We decided what level we could get to and have the backlog for the next quarter after that. Hence my certainty on the $82 million this quarter, we picked that target. No more fancy. We took a straight line, and we started tracking daily to it. And this was a pretty good quarter. The troops did a great job. I was worried because it was the first test and they passed it as a matter of fact, right there, you notice it goes flat that says in the middle of this week instead of working like hell trying to get up here and not quite making it. We told him, you've worked hard. You'd like to have a four-day weekend for the vacation, have a nice weekend, bam. And we went flat and of course, the revenue that we could have accrued there became available to us quickly in the second quarter. Okay. This is for the whole company, new hopes, different kind of story. They had an aggressive plan, they got behind, they had a new plan back this way. They were spiking here. They probably could have made the original plan. But what they did was they got to where they needed to get for the street. This is their component of the street number of the $80 million number. And they also like everybody else took, took the end of the quarter off. Great quarter. Then we have Blue Raven, that was their 1st and 2nd expectation. They redefined the quarter as well. Everybody did and they stayed ahead of it for the rest of the quarter, and they also took off. And in this case, I think they probably could have made the original plan so great quarter. Here's the other story dealers. So, we have a dealer network that buys orders from dealers, and they had a modest plan of $17 million. They started slow and kept on slow and they reduced our plan a big amount. The reduction from $100million to 80 million for our plan. Half of that was, was from the small division missing as planned by a lot. So, we sized up, we're a new company. This quarter defines who we are. And we said this quarter, Q4 defines who we are. And we said we're cutting our head count from 140 to 5 in the dealer division. So instead of having two divisions coming from SunPower new homes and dealer, we had new homes only and then Blue Raven and that's now the company and we took, we took some of the stars and mercy in Blue Raven. So, here's a road chart. So, this half, the company right here is two divisions now that are the company. They have 921 people in this. Although it's got a lot more boxes, there's a lot fewer people, 219 or 19%. And I'm in, I should have drawn that circle up around me. We're all in that. We're support this. These guys make the money, we do things for them. We're CFO, Chief Administrative Legal HR Information Technology. But I would like to introduce Venki. Say it for me. Story Continues Unidentified Participant Sundaresan. T.J. Rodgers Sundaresan, I'm usually pretty good with names but his is kind of simple enough. It, Josy came from, he came from Enphase. where he ran an important division for them. And before that, he came from Cypress semiconductor, he ran all it and this is going to be transformative for our company, you to be here. He lives in Silicon Valley with me today and we have another senior VP I will write about later. We have a new quality VP, his name is Surinder Bedi, and he came from Lucid Motors. So, he actually was at SunPower very early in his career. He's also worked at Applied Materials which is a known high quality Silicon Valley company. And in Lucid, an automotive company and automotive companies have as a group of companies better quality control than I think any other group of companies, perhaps, maybe semiconductors might be up there as well. So anyway, we've done some bolstering of our, of our administrative side. We've got two divisions. These are the guys that make the numbers for us and our overhead is measured on head count is 19% of our population. Okay. Here's an important point. The board honoured our fourth quarter performance with a modest $1.14 million bonus 1.4% of revenue even in the last quarter. Which is rare. My rule number one bonuses, you never get bonus for losing money. But our performance was so good that the board agreed with me that we should do something. This is 1.14 for the entire company that is our, our loss could have been that much less, but we decided to make the loss bigger to reward the employee's management. We chose the bonus money that went to all hands equally. So, it's $1,000 a head to recognize that it was rank and file employees who made the quarter. You know, we said I sit here in Silicon Valley, and I work a lot of hours, but the rank and file made this quarter for us, the management team most significant restricted stock. I pointed out if they ever want to gripe about only $1,000 for me. And that's a tiny fraction of my salary. Managements got a lot of restricted stock and we're waiting for them to get rewarded when the market says they meet and beat the street, a bunch of quarters in a row and then they'll be well rewarded. So, this is a great way to do something for the workers now and remind management that they've still got to perform. Our $81.1 million revenue last quarter redefined our company with annualized revenue of $324 million and a loss of 5.4. When I did the bullet points up front there of them and all I could think was this is really good. It's bam, bam, bam, bam, bam. And all I could think of was Muhammad Ali in one of his first fights. He fought a bar fighter in England. The guy's name is Brian London. One of those big square jawed, mean looking guys. And Ali, the kid from Louisville, Kentucky went to London and they're all worried and they said this guy is no finesse. He will walk directly at Ali put him in a corner and he's got him in a corner. He will punch him once and he'll drop. That was the worry about the fight anyway, in the third quarter of that fight, Ali never got touched, never got touched. He was floating around and the big guy kind of couldn't keep up with him and Ali went up and went, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, 12,12 punches in two point nine eight seconds. And the big guy was standing there, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam and Ali just walked to the center of the ring. The guy fell flat in his face into the ring. So, that's how I felt about those bullet points. So, I had Ali in my mind, and I want to remind you and the employees that our $5.94 million quarterly loss will not survive in 2025 little rhyme there. Also, I want to thank shareholders. You've stuck with us; you've given us money. We are going to rebuild a classic iconic company. And I want to remind all of you how important SunPower used to be. It wasn't run well at the end by a lot. There was contention between the divisions of the company. I would have been unhappy too, but SunPower is an iconic company. They got founded in 1985. They, you can see here the black, the black squares on the wing of the airplane. This airplane's wingspan is bigger than the 747. And it's completely powered by SunPower solar cells that were made in Sunnyvale, California. It takes off under its own power, 1,414 electric motors. So, it was the Tesla of airplanes way back in 1,999. What amazes me about this airplane that really talks about the power of the sun, which I remember when Elon Musk brought out the, brought out the Tesla and everybody said, yeah, golf Court, electric car. All right. So, you bring out the test and you find out you can lay rubber for two blocks. The Tesla pled today does 0point to 61.9 point seconds. You can take the biggest muscle car GTO supercharged that of any of the older cars and, and it'll blow it off the road and these guys did the same thing way back in 1999 because this airplane flew to a record of 96,863 ft and that record still stands. And I'll point out one of the challenges to that record is the F-15 which is a fighter plane been around. It's a Mach 2.5 fighter and it's capable of accelerating. It's one of two airplanes; we have capable of accelerating while climbing vertically and its service ceiling is 72,000 ft. So, this is iconic picture of the power of the sun. It's already happened. You know, we talk about NEM Net Electricity Metering and on NEMs being cut back, meaning that the grid is no longer giving money back to people who are, who are in California anyway, for people who have solar. Well, why is that? Well, that's actually good news. Solar right now in the middle of the day produces more power than they need and they're not going to pay for it. We have; we have a solution for that. It's called the battery. I'm actually in a battery company right now in Silicon Valley, not the one that's going to make our batteries, but we have systems today that will make money and provide technology people need. Right now, we're selling solar systems, good ones, we're using good components. My background is technical and we're going to work on technology as Well, so at the end, the loss will not survive in 2025 and we're going to bring back a great tech. We're going to create a great technology company, you can say bring back but create. Okay. That's it ready for questions. Question and Answer Session Operator Thank you, TJ. As a reminder to our audience, you may send questions to us via the text box at the bottom of your screen. Our first question today comes from Derek Soderberg from Cantor Fitzgerald. Two questions. Actually, the first one is how is the portfolio churn trending in new home in the new homes business? And what's the plan to grow that business? T.J. Rodgers First of all, that businesses are most are more profitable of our two businesses. Right now, its revenues are looking flat, and we have new orders. We're getting, we had a bunch of cancellations. So, the lake went down and we're now putting filling the lake back up. We will be up by the end of the year in new homes, having survived the bankruptcy and the hardest hit part of sun power during its bankruptcy was new homes. Operator Derek's second question was how will CSLR effectively leverage the SunPower brand? Do you have any new plans? T.J. Rodgers I do and this, this little teaser here is part of it. Right now, I want to get more baggable in the corporation, but we are we are going to make use of the name. By the way, we were attacked in court to try to take the name. We want so we own the name. We have the division, the home home division of some power still with us and some other people who were in the dealer division are still with us in Blue Raven. Operator Thank you. The next question is we understand you have contracts with Starbucks. Are there any more commercial deals in the pipeline? And how do you view that business? T.J. Rodgers Okay. I don't, unfortunately, I don't have the picture here. Normally I keep an appendix with all my pictures in it. There's a fantastic picture of Starbucks and they've got an awning. So, you're looking at a 3-story high Starbucks with an awning that sticks out over the entire parking lot, all solar and its glass on glass, solar. So, some panels today are made with glass and then the silicon and then below that another layer of glass. So, when you look at them, you can see right, right through parts of them. That's Starbucks got a 50,000-watt system. We have 57 comp Starbucks we dealt with, I think it's great business, but right now I got two divisions, make a Blue Raven and there they're putting homes all over America throughout the Midwest included. And then I've got new homes. The New Homes division is capable of doing the light commercial. And that may be the place, or we may acquire a company that is in that business? Operator Thank you. The next question is the company has moved through its initial integration and cost reduction, quickly, post-acquisition of the SunPower assets. Can you discuss incremental cost reduction efforts and how much more should the market expect on that front? T.J. Rodgers How much incremental cost reduction should we expect? What you don't know is we're actually ahead of that game. The reason last quarter at a $5.9 million loss was that curve and we had the high part of the curve spending a lot of money then coming down and the average of the quarter was the high part and the low part we're entering the new quarter low. So that cost cutting is there already built in where else we're still paying some rent that we need to get rid of? We still have some software packages we need to stop paying on. But by and large, the heavy lifting is done cutting costs another 30%. Operator Thank you. In a similar vein, you announced achieving operating income break even in the first quarter of 2025 what are the risks to this? T.J. Rodgers The risk is we don't do it. And then I'm making an aggressive announcement which is atypical. As I said earlier, if you could see the spreadsheets actually are in here, but I'm not going to show them. Our, planned profit, including the ability to pay another bonus. Our planned profit is $800,000. Disappears like that if you screw something up. But, if we miss, I don't think it'll be much and if we make it and I think it's more likely than not, we will make it. It's not a given, it will be a big deal. We'll celebrate. Operator Thank you. The next question is with regards to additional acquisitions, what is your appetite? And if you are seeking them would targets, be built on to current positions or seek to expand your footprint and offerings. T.J. Rodgers Give me the choice he gave me, Unidentified Participant (inaudible -microphone inaccessible) T.J. Rodgers I heard that. What are the two choices he gave me? Okay. On expanding. I that can be good or bad problem is you've had in the last two years; you've had 70 solar companies go out of business. Now, you can argue the interest rate is directly what people pay for solar, double the interest rate, double the payment and therefore high interest rates, the inflation that we've unfortunately inflicted on ourselves. He has harmed by solar companies and that's 70. I got a list that's in alphabetical order and so far, is on list having said that solar companies are not run as tightly as other companies. 0.1 and 0.2. the backlog of solar companies. The orders are not as solid, for example, in the chip business, we would take backlog and some and we would make chips for somebody not custom, just a bigger number for another company and they didn't take them after that point in time, they would, they would pay a down payment. And therefore, backlog is pretty sacred in our company as most chip companies, you were locked in the last 30 days to take or pay. So, you had, you were informed 30 days before the order is going to ship, the order is going to ship and that was your last chance to bail out. That backlog is in. So, like that in solar, you actually have teams of people calling other people and how, how are things going and you have a real rate, like 20% of people say, I kind of changed my mind and it's a consumer thing and you can't be the big bad corporation pounding on some poor home homeowner somewhere. So, for that reason, solar companies shrink in to get bigger and smaller by huge factors. So, you can't take a solar company that, big and doing well and buy it at a high price. So, I look more at potential of companies, and I look more at people and if you've got a solid company that has good practices that has customers who love and hasn't eaten up a lot of cash like some par up. Then, then you've got something worth acquiring. So, I look for companies like that. I look for companies that we acquired a company a year ago. And I talked to the founder, and I said we were thinking about acquiring and I said, send me your deck. The guy's name is Cole Farmer. He's still with us. And he said, I don't have a deck. And I said, I'm thinking, how the hell can you not have a deck? And he said, we never raised any money. We funded our first funded our first systems and then the money from that funded the other systems. And I thought my exact thoughts in that Sunday afternoon phone call, there's a real man. He didn't run to Wall Street and get paid and gripe about the economy. He goes and makes money. So that's the kind of company if we acquire and we will acquire if we can non, non-indigenous growth is great, but extra growth through acquisition is fine. That's more like what I'm looking for. Not, some high flying company or a new capability that the consumer commercial rather you talked about earlier. That's a more stable business. You are now dealing with other companies and, and that's a business that, that if we found somebody that was good at it and that means they make bigger systems, they're not talking, not 10 kilowatts on your roof. We're talking about a million watts in a field with control of the angle of the panels to follow the sun. That could be another option. Technology is another option by getting a technology that gives us a better panel or gives us a better panel. And I'm actually working with companies on that right now and that would be something else. So we're not just going to grow. There is there are, there are companies in Salt Lake that tried that, just sort of agglomerating companies and they found out a bunch of small wheat companies equalled one big wheat company, and it didn't work out. That's long answer. Operator Thank you. I have a longer one with respect to the dealer division. It sounds like you shrank the dealer's division to create more profitable growth in the long term. Can you please discuss the strategy and your outlook for that segment? T.J. Rodgers It was a real tight call right at the end to stay in the dealer business or not? The way the dealer business works is you have people who sell orders, they go through their process which is complex, and they get a homeowner to sign a contract. I will, I will buy your system, then they can sell that deal to a company that installs and is a full-service company like ours. And amazingly enough that order is worth 30% or even more sometimes of the value of the order that is getting the order costs you 30% of revenue upfront. Then you deal with the guy who changes his mind, halfway through. Therefore, it's an unstable business and there's, there are tectonic shifts in the business where that goes into fashion goes out of fashion. And what I know from our own experience with the division, we merged into the other division and my company before that complete Solar, the mother of this company--, by the way, oddly enough, complete Solar, the mother of this company is, is grand total of maybe 60 people out of 1,000. And we're spread all over the co company, including my position and, and we're not the company anymore. We are the money and the funding and the guidance for the company. So, we're looking for solid things. It is not quite reasonable to use Warren Buffett's name here. But we're thinking that way when we look at what we can acquire and bring in and which businesses we should grow. And right now dealer does not look like one of those businesses we grow. And by the way, I want to point out that our Blue Raven division is its own dealer. It has a large group of salespeople and, and we get our own orders and therefore we get all the profit going up. So, we understand how it works. We understand what it costs that 30% is not phony. Is that it really takes that much money to get the order and keep it. So, right now, that's not where we want to be. Operator Thank you. Looks like we have two more in the queue. Just a reminder to the audience. If you have any additional questions, you can put them in the text box at the bottom of your screen and we will see them there. The next question is how do you see yourself differentiated versus your peers in the next 6 to 12 months? T.J. Rodgers We will be financially stable on a cash flow basis in tough times. So, Marine Corps, we're going to come out of this being a difficult company to compete with in a consumer business. We are going and are now we have great consumer ratings. We're going to get better on that and then the new angle is going to be technology and acquisition. Which again, I can't, I right now, I'm working on several technologies and I can't name one for you that I'm ready to move on and in acquisitions, we're always looking at acquisitions. Always. Operator Thank you. The last question I have here is, can you provide any timing on when your name change to SunPower might occur? T.J. Rodgers I'm surprised that that is a major. Well, I asked for it, right? I showed the picture of the airplane. Can't right now problem we've got is the SunPower. I knew I was the Chairman of SunPower when public in the 2000, I think it was 2004. I was Chairman of SunPower Cypress Semiconductor. My company owned them and the SunPower. I remember that conquered the world and built and put the power on that airplane. Wasn't the one that was experienced in Salt Lake. It was a something that would cause dislike if you worked with them. And so, I got half the company that doesn't remember SunPower. Well, but I got a name that's worth half a billion dollars and I got to figure out how to make all that work together. Operator Thank you very much. That looks like all the questions we have in the queue today. Thank you everyone for joining the call today. You may now disconnect.

Positive Points Guaranty Bancshares Inc ( NYSE:GNTY ) reported strong performance metrics, including robust credit metrics, liquidity, capital, and earnings. The company plans to utilize its strong capital position to aggressively buy back stock, aiming to enhance shareholder value. Net interest margin improved significantly to 3.54% in the fourth quarter, up from 3.3% in the previous quarter. Nonperforming assets remain at very low levels, with nonperforming assets to total assets at 0.16% at year-end. The company has a strong funding base of core deposits, with total deposits increasing by $23 million during the fourth quarter. Negative Points Total assets decreased by $69 million for the year, primarily due to a smaller loan portfolio. Net loans were down $5 million during the fourth quarter, and the company sold an REO property with a book value of $14 million. Equity was down slightly in the fourth quarter due to an increase in unrealized losses in the AFS securities portfolio. The company experienced a decrease in cash balances of about $17 million during the fourth quarter. Unrealized losses on investment securities increased during the fourth quarter, with total net unrealized losses at $52.2 million. Story Continues Q & A Highlights Q : The NIM expansion was really nice to see in the quarter. I wanted to start off on the loan yields. They were actually up quarter-over-quarter. Just wanted to make sure there wasn't any sort of onetime interest benefit in the quarter. And assuming not, how do you think about that loan yield going forward? A : Shalene Jacobson, CFO: We did have a small amount of nonaccrual interest that came back on, but it was less than $500,000, so it wouldn't have been real meaningful to the NIM. If the Fed keeps rates flat, we probably won't move our cost of deposits much. We have about $450 million of variable rate loans that will reprice during 2025, so we expect loan yields to continue to rise. Q : Looking at the overall NIM, is the expectation that it can continue to expand from the fourth quarter level? A : Tyson Abston, CEO: Yes, we're modeling continued growth in our NIM throughout '25. We're not giving specific guidance, but we see expansion in our NIM in different rate environments, whether rates go up, down, or stay flat. Q : Do you think we begin to see loans growing in the first quarter of 2025? Or is it going to take some time? A : Tyson Abston, CEO: We anticipate some loan growth, but we're not sure exactly how it will net out during the year. We have the capacity and liquidity to grow the loan book as we see quality opportunities, and we're more optimistic on loan growth in '25 than in the last two years. Q : How does the loan-to-deposit ratio impact your view on deposit growth in the year ahead with the potential for loan growth to pick up? A : Tyson Abston, CEO: Focusing on deposit growth as a core strategy isn't our focus for '25, but we are always focused on building core deposit relationships. We generally open about 10,000 new checking accounts a year, which is a core driver of franchise value. Q : Any color for us for the expense growth in 2025? A : Shalene Jacobson, CFO: We're expecting expenses to be up only about 1% or 2% next year. We're targeting a 2.5% expense growth relative to total assets, with some commercial loan officers built into our budget for 2025. Q : On the M&A theme, what are your updated thoughts around consolidation in Texas? A : Tyson Abston, CEO: We're open to anything that makes sense for our shareholders long term. We're primarily focused on organic growth but are in a position to be acquisitive if the right opportunity comes along. Q : Is there any reason to think that you would have any sort of provision expense in the near term? A : Shalene Jacobson, CFO: Our ACL model is based on qualitative factors and forward economic estimates. If the economy continues to improve, we may adjust those factors down and reduce our provision unless we grow significantly. Q : How aggressive would you like to be with the buyback? A : Tyson Abston, CEO: We're willing to be more aggressive with the buyback. We see a disconnect between the intrinsic value of the bank and where we're trading, so we plan to be more aggressive in utilizing our buyback capacity.

GAAP/non-GAAP reconciliation attached. Acquiring SunPower Assets In early September \u201924 Complete Solar was presented with an opportunity to hire SunPower employees and acquire SPWR assets that would scale Complete Solar and its value at a rate unachievable just weeks before. We needed to raise money ($80 million), to get approval from the SunPower board for our so-called stalking-horse chapter 11 plan in which our small company would acquire over 1,000 employees from solar icon SunPower Corporation that in effect was an IPO for the three divisions acquired from SunPower. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware approved our plan, and we began the integration. Revenue Projection The first five-quarter plan (Q4\u201924-Q4\u201925) presented to investors in the $80 million funding presentation called for $100 million in revenue in Q4\u201924 for the combined company with a sustainable operating income loss of $1.0 million, followed in Q2\u201925 by its first profitable quarter ($0.4 million). Story Continues \u201cNewCo\u201d (Complete Solar Plus \u201cOld SunPower\u201d Plus its Blue Raven Solar Subsidiary) The combined team worked throughout October and early November to reorganize into a new start-up like organization designed to be lean enough to achieve breakeven with $100 million in revenue. That organization is shown below as deployed in order of size in Utah, Rest of US, Texas and the Philippines. Certain administrative functions were centralized to provide great savings in headcount, also shown below: Org Chart Complete Solar Announces Preliminary Q3\u201924 Results Our companies were not combined until October 1, 2024, so there are no GAAP and non-GAAP results to report for the combined business for Q3\u201924, but the following chart shows preliminary and unaudited Q3\u201924 results based on a simple summing of the separate results shown on November 6 to employees and investors. Operating Income Division Charter Revenue Prior Report by Division New Homes Sales to homebuilders $53.2 N/A ($11.9) Blue Raven Solar Sales direct to customer $43.5 N/A ($6.9) Dealer (+ CSLR) Sales of jobs from dealers $ 20.6 1 N/A ($21.3) $117.3 4 ($73.8) 2 ($40.0) 3 1. Contains $5.5M in revenue from the \u201cold CSLR\u201d and $15.1M in revenue from the old SunPower \u201cDealer\u201d Division now combined as NewCo\u2019s \u201cDealer\u201d Division. 2. Contains write-offs due to the bankruptcy & acquisition. 3. High costs due to running the pre-layoff employment levels of both companies during the quarter. 4. High revenue due to accumulated backlog at SunPower when it was shut down in Q1\u201924 and Q2\u201924. Combined revenue in Q3\u201924 for NewCo was $117.3 million. On a standalone basis, Complete Solar\u2019s Q3\u201924 revenue was $5.5 million of the $20.6 reported for \u201cDealer\u201d Revenue for Q4\u201924 is now expected to be $80 million, lower sequentially due to benefits accumulated backlog in Q3 that will not carry over to Q4\u201924 The operating income loss is now expected to drop from ($40.0M) in Q3\u201924 to $2-11 million in Q4\u201924 due to the significant headcount reduction Complete Solar CEO, T.J. Rodgers said, \u201cOn Wednesday, November 6, 2024 at our Orem, Utah HQ, we presented to over 1,000 employees the details of our Rev. 5 Annual Operating Plan for cutting headcount and other costs to achieve breakeven operating income in 2025. Rodgers continued, \u201cOur Q3\u201924 results of $117 million in combined revenue overstates our current revenue rate due to the pileup of SunPower backlog in Q1 & Q2\u201924. Our current belief is that our revenue will be $80 million in Q4\u201924, as calculated by extrapolating shipments to known customers from orders in mid-process in our factory. Rodgers concluded, \u201cOur Q3\u201924 opex of $43.5 million will shrink to $17.0 million in Q4\u201924 due to actions already implemented with more to follow in each quarter of 2025.\u201d About Complete Solar With its recent acquisition of SunPower assets, Complete Solar has become a leading residential solar services provider in North America.
