[{"text": "Cabot (CBT) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy? Zacks Equity Research Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 6:00 PM 5 min read In This Article: EMN +1.14% Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Cabot (CBT) reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates. The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 3, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This chemical company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.80 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +15.4%. Revenues are expected to be $992.98 million, up 3.7% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change. Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction). The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Story Continues Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cabot? For Cabot, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.51%. On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4. So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cabot will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue? While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Cabot would post earnings of $1.82 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.80, delivering a surprise of -1.10%. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times. Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Cabot doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release. Expected Results of an Industry Player Eastman Chemical (EMN), another stock in the Zacks Chemical - Diversified industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.58 for the quarter ended December 2024. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +20.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $2.26 billion, up 2.3% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus EPS estimate for Eastman Chemical has been revised 2.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.10%. This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Eastman Chemical will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.

"Awakn Life Sciences Provides Update on R&D Programs, Progressing Novel Therapeutics for Alcohol Use Disorder and PTSD Newsfile Corp. Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 10:00 AM 8 \u5206\u9418\u95b1\u8b80\u6642\u9593 \u5728\u9019\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\u4e2d: AWKNF 0.00% Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - January 27, 2025) - Awakn Life Sciences Corp. (CSE: AWKN) (OTC Pink: AWKNF) (FSE: 954) (\"Awakn\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing therapeutics for substance use and mental health disorders, is pleased to provide an update on its research and development (R&D) programs. Awakn currently has three main R&D programs: 1. AWKN-001 An investigational, novel combination therapy, consisting of an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-modulating drug (ketamine) delivered intravenously (IV) in combination with manualized relapse prevention cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for the treatment of severe Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) in the UK and potentially the EU. Current Status: AWKN-001 is in Phase 3 in the UK. The trial is co-funded by a partnership between the UK's Medical Research Council (MRC) and the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), and Awakn Life Sciences Corp. It is managed by the University of Exeter Clinical Trials Unit. Awakn's costs for this trial are capped at GB\u00a3800,000 / CA$1.4m. Regulatory Path and Exclusivity: Awakn is targeting a Regulation 52b hybrid application in the UK for AWKN-001. If successful, this could provide 8 years of market exclusivity, with an additional 2 years of supplementary protection, preventing competitors from marketing a similar product for the same indication. 2. AWKN-002 A proprietary oral thin film (OTF) formulation of esketamine for sublingual and buccal administration, developed in combination with structured alcohol education for moderate to severe Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) in the U.S. Current Status: Awakn has in-licensed a Phase 1 program from LTS Lohmann Therapie-Systeme AG and completed two mechanistic studies in AUD with AWKN-002. These studies were used to file method-of-use patents. Awakn also completed a Pre-Investigational New Drug (Pre-IND) meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which confirmed that AWKN-002 can be reviewed under the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway. The FDA further confirmed that no additional clinical data are needed to proceed with a Phase 2b trial in patients with moderate to severe AUD. Regulatory Path and Exclusivity: Awakn plans to submit an IND Application for AWKN-002 in H2 2025, followed by a Clinical Trial Application (\"CTA\") for a Phase 2b trial in H1 2026. In due course, Awakn will submit a NDA under the 505(b)(2) pathway. The reference product for Awakn's NDA will be J&J's Spravato\u00ae, which is forecast to achieve US$1bn in sales in 2024. Subject to successful clinical trial outcomes and FDA approval, AWKN-002 could be granted up to 5 years of market exclusivity in the US for the treatment of AUD, provided its patents are granted and recognised in the US Orange Book. Awakn anticipates that the Phase 2b clinical trial application will be made in 2026. \u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80 3. AWKN-SND-14 A series of serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline modulators under pre-clinical investigation for trauma-related mental health disorders, including Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). This program was previously referred to as Awakn's aminoindane new chemical entity program. Program Focus: AWKN-SND-14 is designed to promote pro-social behavior with a potentially improved safety profile compared to current investigational PTSD treatments. By enhancing trust, empathy, and social bonding-critical elements in addressing PTSD-AWKN-SND-14 aims to help individuals rebuild relationships, overcome isolation, and engage more effectively in therapy. Anthony Tennyson, CEO of Awakn, commented: \"We are excited about the progress across our key R&D programs, particularly in the areas of Alcohol Use Disorder and PTSD. With the advancements we've made in AWKN-001 and AWKN-002, we're on track to deliver transformative therapies for patients in need of more effective solutions.\" Prof. David Nutt, Chief Research Officer of Awakn, added: \"Our ongoing work with AWKN-SND-14 is especially promising, as it targets the underlying mechanisms of PTSD. We're optimistic about its potential to offer a safer, more effective option for individuals suffering from trauma-related disorders.\" About AUD Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a chronic, relapsing brain health disorder characterized by compulsive alcohol use, loss of control over drinking, and negative emotional states when not using alcohol. It affects individuals across diverse demographics and can lead to a wide range of physical, psychological, and social consequences. AUD affects approximately 29 million 1 adults in the US with the Company estimating a current affected population of 40 million in the US and US and key European markets. Despite this high prevalence treatment success rates are very low with up to 75% of patients with AUD returning to harmful drinking within 12 months of treatment 2 . This high prevalence rate and low treatment success rate create a significant unmet medical need, a significant public health concern, and an enormous economic cost $249 billion in the US 3 . About PTSD PTSD is a debilitating mental health condition characterized by persistent and distressing symptoms resulting from exposure to traumatic events. Individuals with PTSD often experience intrusive memories, flashbacks, nightmares, hypervigilance, and avoidance behaviors, leading to significant impairment in daily functioning and overall well-being. Despite its prevalence, with an estimated 13 4 million adults in the US and with the Company estimating a current affected population of 20 million in the US and key European markets affected by PTSD, the condition remains underdiagnosed and underserved. Current treatment options often fall short in providing adequate relief, leaving many individuals without effective therapeutic solutions About Awakn Life Sciences Corp. Awakn Life Sciences Corp. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing therapeutics targeting substance use and mental health disorders. Awakn has a near-term focus on AUD, a condition affecting approximately 29 million adults in the US and approximately 40 million in the US and key European markets for which the current standard of care is inadequate. Our goal is to provide breakthrough therapeutics to addiction sufferers in desperate need and our strategy is focused on commercialising our R&D pipeline across multiple channels. www.awaknlifesciences.com | LinkedIn | X (formerly Twitter) Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information This news release contains certain forward-looking information and forward-looking statements, as defined in applicable securities laws (collectively referred to herein as \"forward-looking statements\").
