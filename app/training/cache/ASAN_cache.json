New York, USA, Jan. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glioblastoma Market, an Area With High Trial Failure And Unmet Need is Expected to Witness Significant Growth Owing to Increased Usage of Bevacizumab, Temozolimide, Optune Gio Along with Emergence of New Class of Therapies | DelveInsight The current therapeutic landscape of glioblastoma in the US is driven by the current treatment paradigm, which comprises therapies such as radiation, bevacizumab & its biosimilars, temozolimide as mono or combination therapies, Optune, along with several other systemic therapies. The glioblastoma market is estimated to change significantly during the period 2020\u20132034 owing to the expected launches of a few new classes such as vaccines and fusion proteins. DelveInsight\u2019s Glioblastoma Market Insights report includes a comprehensive understanding of current treatment practices, emerging glioblastoma drugs, market share of individual therapies, and current and forecasted glioblastoma market size from 2020 to 2034, segmented into 7MM [the United States, the EU4 (Germany, France, Italy, and Spain), the United Kingdom, and Japan]. Key Takeaways from the Glioblastoma Market Report According to DelveInsight\u2019s analysis, the market size of glioblastoma in the 7MM is expected to grow at a significant CAGR by 2034 owing to an increased usage of the current standard of care therapies along with the expected entry of a newer class of therapies Among the 7MM, the highest number of incident cases were observed in the US, which is around 14,500 in 2023. Targeted therapies for GBM often focus on molecular pathways like EGFR, mTOR, PI3K, and VEGF . AVASTIN (bevacizumab), a VEGF inhibitor, has five FDA-approved biosimilars, including MVASI, ZIRABEV, ALYMSYS, VEGZELMA (launched), and AVZIVI (approved December 2023). Drug development for brain cancer lags in comparison to other types of cancers with larger patient populations. Only 5% of new investigational drug applications submitted to the FDA for cancer therapies are successful , and for brain cancer, the rate of success has been closer to 1% over the past two decades. Prominent companies including Laminar Pharmaceuticals, BioMimetix, Enterome, Genenta Science, Medicenna Therapeutics, Bayer, Chimerix, Aivita Biomedical, Denovo Biopharma, Northwest Biotherapeutics, MedImmune, DNAtrix, Imvax, MimiVax, CNS Pharmaceuticals, Oblato, Enterome, VBI Vaccines , and others, are actively working on innovative glioblastoma drugs. Even though trial failure rate is quite high in glioblastoma space and the probability of success remains quite uncertain, few novel glioblastoma therapies are still anticipated to enter the glioblastoma market during the forecast period, Some of the key glioblastoma treatments include LAM561, BMX-001, EO2401, Temferon, MDNA55, Regorafenib, ONC201, AV-GBM-1, Enzastaurin (DB-102), DCVax-L, MEDI4736 (durvalumab), DNX-2401, IGV-001, SurVaxM, Berubicin, OKN-007, EO2401, VBI-1901 , and others. Numerous cancer vaccines for the first, second, and above line of treatment are in the development phases. Northwest Biotherapeutics, TVAX Biomedical, Aivita Biomedical, Inovio Pharmaceuticals , and many others are developing cancer vaccines for GBM. Encouraging results have sparked hope for GBM immunotherapy, including checkpoint inhibitors, CAR T cells, oncolytic virotherapy, and vaccines , with ongoing studies exploring combinations to enhance efficacy and reduce side effects. Story Continues Discover which therapies are expected to grab the glioblastoma market share @ Glioblastoma Market Report Glioblastoma Overview Glioblastoma, also known as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is a highly aggressive and malignant brain tumor that originates from glial cells, which provide support and protection for neurons. The precise causes of glioblastoma remain largely unknown, though genetic mutations, environmental factors, and certain pre-existing conditions may contribute to its development. Common glioblastoma symptoms include persistent headaches, seizures, nausea, vomiting, cognitive changes, and motor deficits, which vary depending on the tumor's location within the brain. Diagnosis typically involves neuroimaging techniques such as MRI or CT scans, which reveal the tumor's presence and its characteristics. A biopsy or surgical resection is often performed to obtain a tissue sample for histological analysis, confirming the diagnosis and guiding treatment strategies. Despite advances in treatment, glioblastoma remains challenging due to its aggressive nature and tendency to infiltrate surrounding brain tissue. Glioblastoma Epidemiology Segmentation The glioblastoma epidemiology section provides insights into the historical and current glioblastoma patient pool and forecasted trends for the 7MM. It helps recognize the causes of current and forecasted patient trends by exploring numerous studies and views of key opinion leaders. The glioblastoma market report proffers epidemiological analysis for the study period 2020\u20132034 in the 7MM segmented into: Total Incident Cases of GBM Gender-specific Incident Cases of GBM Type-specific Incident Cases of GBM Incident Cases Based on Histologic Classification of GBM Incident Cases Based on the Primary Site of GBM Age-specific Incident Cases of GBM Download the report to understand which factors are driving glioblastoma epidemiology trends @ Glioblastoma Epidemiological Insights Glioblastoma Treatment Market Treatment for glioblastoma multiforme typically involves a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or stereotactic radiosurgery. Surgery is a crucial component of the treatment but is rarely used alone. Given the rapid growth of glioblastomas, complete removal is often challenging. Thus, surgery aims for the maximum safe resection\u2014removing as much of the tumor as possible while preserving brain function and healthy tissue. After surgery, residual cancer cells are targeted with additional treatments like chemotherapy or radiation therapy. These subsequent treatments, known as adjuvant therapies, are applied once the diagnosis is confirmed. Due to the potential side effects of this comprehensive treatment approach, steroids are often prescribed to manage these side effects effectively. The FDA has recognized that current treatments for GBM are only palliative, as recurrence is unavoidable following initial radiation. Additionally, chemotherapy is not effective, and there have been no comprehensive reports of objective responses. Despite advancements in patient survival with the introduction of TEMODAR (temozolomide) and AVASTIN (bevacizumab), there is still no effective cure for GBM, resulting in persistently low survival rates for those diagnosed with the condition. Learn more about the market of glioblastoma @ Glioblastoma Treatment Glioblastoma Emerging Drugs and Companies Some of the drugs in the pipeline include BMX-001 (BioMimetix), EO2401 (Enterome), LAM561 (Laminar Pharmaceuticals), MDNA55 (Medicenna), Temferon (Genenta Science), and others. Other classes of emerging therapies include checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cells, oncolytic virotherapy, and vaccines, In fact, few Second and third-generation CAR-T cell therapies have also shown promising preclinical efficacy in extending patient survival in the treatment of GBM . LAM561 (2-hydroxyoleic acid) is a synthetic form of oleic acid that can be taken orally and has the potential to cross the Blood Brain Barrier to reach brain cells. This drug modifies the plasma membrane composition in cancer cells, decreasing the activity of membrane-associated signaling proteins that contribute to tumor growth. Initial results for LAM561 in treating aggressive brain tumors, such as glioblastomas, are promising. Currently, it is undergoing a Phase II/III clinical trial. According to the company\u2019s development plan, LAM561 is expected to receive approval for treating glioma in adults by 2024, and for pediatric glioma by 2025/2026. BMX-001 is a metalloporphyrin, a new type of small molecule with redox activity. It is designed to replicate the active site of superoxide dismutase and primarily works by modulating cellular signaling pathways. Currently, BMX-001 is undergoing a Phase II clinical trial for patients with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma. In January 2020, BMX-001 received Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) , followed by a Fast Track Designation (FTD) in May 2020. In 2022, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) to BMX-001 for use alongside standard radiotherapy and temozolomide in treating newly diagnosed high-grade glioma. The other pipeline therapies for glioblastoma include LAM561: Laminar Pharmaceuticals BMX-001: BioMimetix EO2401: Enterome Temferon: Genenta Science MDNA55: Medicenna Therapeutics Regorafenib: Bayer ONC201: Chimerix AV-GBM-1: Aivita Biomedical Enzastaurin (DB-102): Denovo Biopharma DCVax-L: Northwest Biotherapeutics MEDI4736 (durvalumab): MedImmune DNX-2401: DNAtrix IGV-001: Imvax SurVaxM: MimiVax Berubicin: CNS Pharmaceuticals OKN-007: Oblato EO2401: Enterome VBI-1901: VBI Vaccines The anticipated launch of these emerging therapies are poised to transform the glioblastoma market landscape in the coming years. As these cutting-edge therapies continue to mature and gain regulatory approval, they are expected to reshape the glioblastoma market landscape, offering new standards of care and unlocking opportunities for medical innovation and economic growth. To know more about glioblastoma clinical trials, visit @ Glioblastoma Treatment Drugs Glioblastoma Market Dynamics The glioblastoma market dynamics are anticipated to change in the coming years. Vaccine approaches, such as those developed by MimiVax (SurVaxM), Immunomic Therapeutics (ITI-1000), and IMVAX (IGV-001), offer an attractive adjuvant therapy for solid tumors by generating long-term immune surveillance against cancer cells. Nanocarrier delivery methods, including nanoparticles and prodrugs , are promising for drug transport across the blood-brain barrier. Currently, the GBM market relies on temozolomide and bevacizumab , but lacks a curative strategy, presenting an opportunity for the development of new treatments. The conditional and time-limited approval of Daiichi\u2019s DELYTACT , an intratumoral oncolytic virus therapy, has paved the way for other companies like DNAtrix and Istari Oncology to explore oncolytic virus therapies as potential future treatments for brain cancer. Furthermore, many potential therapies are being investigated for the treatment of glioblastoma, and it is safe to predict that the treatment space will significantly impact the glioblastoma market during the forecast period. Moreover, the anticipated introduction of emerging therapies with improved efficacy and a further improvement in the diagnosis rate is expected to drive the growth of the glioblastoma market in the 7MM. However, several factors may impede the growth of the glioblastoma market. Almost all GBM tumors that respond to first-line therapy eventually recur, and there is no standard approach for successfully treating recurrent GBM. The clinical trial landscape for GBM is marked by long development times, inadequate dissemination of information, suboptimal decision-making, and low patient participation , necessitating larger multicenter studies. The molecular and cellular complexity of gliomas, compounded by significant intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity, limits both diagnosis and treatment , impacting the development of effective biomarkers. Additionally, the brain\u2019s protective blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevents most new drugs from reaching brain tumors, posing a critical challenge in developing effective therapies for malignant brain tumors. Moreover, glioblastoma treatment poses a significant economic burden and disrupts patients\u2019 overall well-being and QOL. Furthermore, the glioblastoma market growth may be offset by failures and discontinuation of emerging therapies , unaffordable pricing , market access and reimbursement issues , and a shortage of healthcare specialists . In addition, the undiagnosed, unreported cases and the unawareness about the disease may also impact the glioblastoma market growth.

"LIVE The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs Asana, Inc. (ASAN): Unlocking Growth with AI-Driven Work Management Solutions Niloy Chakrabarti Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 4:16 PM 3 min read In This Article: ASAN We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street\u2019s Radar . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Asana, Inc. (NYSE:ASAN) stands against other AI stocks on Wall Street\u2019s radar. Artificial Intelligence (AI) companies are rapidly focusing on securing funding to propel R&D, roll out products and services across diverse sectors, and create interconnected ecosystems amid fierce industry competition. According to Reuters analysis of PitchBook data, AI startups have single-handedly contributed to the rebound of US venture capital funding, as total capital raised last year jumped 30% year over year. More importantly, AI startups comprised 46.4% of the total $209 billion raised in 2024, as optimism around AI-powered technology sparked a year-long market rally led by tech giants and semiconductor leaders. However, concerns remain about the rapidly evolving technology as tech leaders prioritise enforcing guardrails to ensure the best use of AI. OpenAI CEO at Davos 2024 OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said during his speech at Davos 2024: \u201cI think it\u2019s good that we and others are being held to a high standard. We can draw on lessons from the past about how technology has been made to be safe and how different stakeholders have handled negotiations about what safe means.\u201d \u201cLet society and the technology co-evolve, and sort of step-by-step with a very tight feedback loop and course correction, build these systems that deliver tremendous value while meeting safety requirements,\u201d he added. Overall, the global markets are optimistic about how leading companies are increasingly developing and integrating AI in their workflows and strategies globally. PWC\u2019s AI Global Study projected that the AI industry could contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, boosting GDP for local economies by 26% on average. Here are the top 10 AI stocks driving the transition to a new era of product development, data flow, and sustainability in 2025. For this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

MNDY shares have also underperformed its industry peer, BILL Holdings BILL which has gained 80.7% over the trailing six-months.

"LIVE The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs Rigetti Computing (RGTI) Soars 42.2%: Is Further Upside Left in the Stock? Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 6:40 PM 2 min read In This Article: RGTIW ASAN Rigetti Computing, Inc. RGTI shares soared 42.2% in the last trading session to close at $13.98. The move was backed by solid volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This compares to the stock's 10.3% loss over the past four weeks. RGTI is benefitting from an expanding clientele and its growing influence in the quantum computing space. This company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.08 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +11.1%. Revenues are expected to be $2.4 million, down 29% from the year-ago quarter. Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements. For Rigetti Computing, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions. So, make sure to keep an eye on RGTI going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

tariffs Asana (ASAN) Stock Trades Up, Here Is Why Max Juang Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 9:55 PM 3 min read In This Article: ASAN Asana (ASAN) Stock Trades Up, Here Is Why What Happened? Shares of work management software maker Asana (NYSE: ASAN) jumped 9% in the morning session as the major indices soared (Nasdaq +1.9%, S&P 500 +1.6%) after the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that core CPI (Consumer Price Index - a measure of inflation which strips out volatile food and energy prices) for December 2024 came in better than expected, rising 3.2% year over year, compared to the consensus estimate for a 3.3% increase. This means that PPI and CPI both came in slightly below expectations. It is important because the results take additional rate hikes off the table, which some investors and market participants were beginning to whisper about. As a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. The result of lower interest rates, all else equal, is higher stock valuations. This is especially true for higher-growth stocks, such as those in the technology sector, where the current value depends more on cash flows many years out in the future. In addition, the earnings season is off to a strong start: Banking giants like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs posted solid quarterly results, further lifting investor sentiment. The true test will come in the coming month or so as the bulk of large publicly-traded companies report their result. The shares closed the day at $19.68, up 5.1% from previous close. Is now the time to buy Asana? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free . What The Market Is Telling Us Asana\u2019s shares are very volatile and have had 29 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 9 days ago when the stock gained 9.2% on the news that Piper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin upgraded the stock's rating from Neutral to Overweight (Buy) and raised the price target from $19 to $27. The upgrade was based on \"the company's stabilization, cost management, and promising AI innovations.\" Asana is down 1% since the beginning of the year, and at $19.65 per share, it is trading 28.6% below its 52-week high of $27.52 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Asana\u2019s shares at the IPO in September 2020 would now be looking at an investment worth $682.29. Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefiting from the rise of AI.

news and updates on Trump's tariffs Bank of America reveals top technology stock pick for 2025 Silin Chen Thu, Jan 16, 2025, 6:33 PM 4 min read In This Article: CRM The risks are undeniable. After two years of impressive gains, the software sector could easily take a breather. But analysts aren\u2019t betting on it. \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb8 Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb8 Bank of America analysts revealed that although the U.S. software market grew 59% in 2023 and 23% in 2024, development projections still run below historical averages. \"Revenue multiples and growth expectations remain below 5-year median and pre-Covid levels,\u201d Bank of America said in its Jan. 14 report, pointing to the potential of three secular themes for 2025: Agentic AI, growing enterprise IT budgets, and sustained cloud migration. Salesforce's CEO Marc Benioff believes Agentic AI is a bold leap in the future of work.Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images Three growth themes explained Agentic AI refers to AI systems that can learn, act, and make decisions autonomously, without constant human input. Bank of America sees it as a key differentiator for software companies. \u201cAgentic AI deployments could displace workers as early as 2H25 across industries, such as contact centers, software engineering and marketing,\u201d the firm noted. Related: Analyst picks Microsoft as best stock to play AI spending surge in 2025 The second key trend is accelerated enterprise IT spending, which is expected to gather pace through 2026. Tech heavyweights like Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon are spending heavily on AI and will likely expand their investments in 2025. \u201cDemand continues to be higher than our available capacity,\u201d Amy Hood, Microsoft\u2019s finance chief, said during the company's earnings call last October. Moreover, sustained cloud migration remains a key growth driver for the software sector as optimization headwinds ease, Bank of America said. \"Although we remain selective on small caps, we are bullish on the software sector for 2025, particularly in 2H, as accelerating secular tailwinds and easing cyclical headwinds converge,\" the firm added. So, who could be the winners in this gold rush? Bank of America has its bets. Bank of America names Salesforce as its top pick for 2025 Bank of America sees potential for positive returns in undervalued names within subsectors like CRM (customer relationship management) and Infrastructure, which the firm identifies as particularly well-positioned for growth in 2025.

Story Continues Salesforce is often seen as the leader in leveraging AI to enhance customer relationship management, and BofA calls it a \"leading front office Agentic AI play.\" Salesforce unveiled Agentforce 2.0 on Dec.17, which is its latest digital labor platform that can autonomously provide customer support without preprogrammed responses. Agentforce's clients include IBM ( IBM ) , Finnair, Accenture ( ACN ) , and Heathrow Airport. They are using the platform to augment their teams, streamline operations, and unlock new growth opportunities. Salesforce reported fiscal third-quarter results on Dec. 3. Revenue surpassed Wall Street's expectations, but earnings fell slightly short. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.41, slightly missing Wall Street\u2019s expectation of $2.44. Revenue grew 8% year-over-year to $9.44 billion, beating the $9.34 billion consensus estimate. The company also raised the low end of its fiscal 2025 revenue guidance, now expecting $37.8 billion to $38 billion. This caused Salesforce's stock price to surge 11% on the next trading day following the earnings. Salesforce's chief executive Marc Benioff highlighted the company's momentum in artificial intelligence, particularly the Agentforce platform. \u201cThis is a bold leap in the future of work, where AI agents let humans unite to transform all of our customer interactions,\u201d Benioff said. Salesforce positioned for $80 AI-driven upside, Wedbush said Investment firm Wedbush is also positive about Salesforce stock into 2025. The firm is generally bullish in the broader software sector and has highlighted Salesforce as one of the biggest potential winners, along with Palantir ( PLTR ) . \"We believe CRM is a clear 2nd derivative beneficiary of the AI Revolution that could add ~$80 per share to the CRM story as this monetization story takes shape over the next 12 to 18 months,\" Wedbush's analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a December report.

This Article: HYMTF The Hyundai brand might have had an awful 2024 in China but against that, South Korea, The Americas, India and Europe were all strong. Year-on-year deliveries dipped by 1.8 per cent to 4,141,791 vehicles split 705,010 (-7.5%) for the home market and 3,436,781 (-0.5%) elsewhere. Plans for 2025 and beyond will see a record spend of 24.3 trillion won (US$16.6 bn) this year by Hyundai-Genesis-Kia plus Mobis, so the OEM\u2019s three marques and in-house Tier 1 are well placed for growth. Half of the just-announced investment will go into R&D for innovation, and as the largest brand, Hyundai should benefit the most. This report explores a selection of likely future models, the life cycles of which would extend into the mid-2030s in certain cases. EREVs coming for major markets Let\u2019s look first at China, where sales fell by more than a third from already low levels. Hyundai is well aware of the issues causing this collapse and vows to continue working on them. Notably, more hybrids, including a range extender powertrain, are promised, as are market-specific EVs. In 2024, the company retailed fewer than 150,000 locally made cars and SUVs in the world\u2019s largest market - a far cry from the years when its JV with BAIC was booming. Only the Tucson, Custo and Mufasa are selling more 1,000 units monthly, which means the Sonata, ix25 and Santa Fe will likely not be replaced when their life cycles end. Cars The i10, a small hatchback which is mainly for India and Europe, is now on its third generation and due to be replaced in 2026. Build should again be in both Chennai and Izmit (Turkey). We should also see a new i20 next year, manufactured in the same plants. One size up is the i30. Generation four is due for launch in 2027 and this model should again be mainly for European markets with build in the Czech Republic. Roughly six months before this car arrives, the follow-up to today\u2019s Avante (Elantra is many markets) is set to premiere in South Korea. An evolution of the current model\u2019s architecture should be the basis of the eighth generation car. By contrast to how it\u2019s been performing in the PRC, the Sonata has enjoyed quite a comeback in both Korea and the USA, helped by competitors leaving the size segment. Launched in 2019 and facelifted in 2023, the next Sonata is set to debut in 2026. Its platform will most probably be N4. Above the Sonata, the Grandeur is now approaching mid-life and will be facelifted later in 2025. At the same time, Hyundai is said to be planning the addition of a PHEV and/or an EREV. The replacement comes in 2028. Story Continues MPV Highly distinctive and a good seller, the Staria line-up will be expanded later in 2025 via the addition of an EV. Production will be on Line 1 at the Ulsan 4 plant. There should also be a facelift for the petrol hybrid, LPG and diesel variants this year. The replacements would be due in 2028 but the ST1 light commercial derivative might not be altered until the early 2030s. Pick-ups Not too many details are official as yet but what is known is that Hyundai has a JV pick-up on the way due in 2027. Under development with General Motors, it is understood that this model will not be related to the Kia Tasman. It is thought that the GM model will be the successor for South America\u2019s Chevrolet S-10 replacement. This means a body-on-frame chassis. There is also thought to be a separate project for an electric pick-up, potentially in two sizes. Details on this one are scarce though the Ioniq 7 and Ioniq 10 names are rumoured, following trademark applications having been lodged for both. As for the Santa Cruz, a monocoque pick-up built in the USA, it received a facelift for the 2025 model year and so will be due for replacement in CY2027. The second generation model should use HMG\u2019s forthcoming N4 architecture (FWD and AWD) and this time around a hybrid powertrain is highly likely. Crossovers & SUVs: A & B segments The Inster, which is about to be launched in Europe, is known in South Korea as the Casper Electric. There are two batteries as well as a crossover derivative. As this tiny vehicle is based on a petrol-powered model which dates to 2021, the Inster/Casper should be replaced as soon as 2028/2029. Petrol and electric powertrains are believed to be planned. Build of a special model for India (code: He1i) is also planned. Sold mainly in North America and India, the Venue comes in two lengths so as to slip beneath a tax category in the latter market: the Chennai-built model is 3,995 mm long or 45 mm shorter than the Ulsan-manufactured alternative. The second generation Venue may be revealed as soon as this year, potentially debuting at a US auto show, possibly New York in April. India\u2019s model (code: Q2Xi) likely won\u2019t be in production there until 2026 or even 2027, however. An EV will inevitably also be offered. Will there be a successor for the Bayon when its lifecycle ends in 2027? It could go either way but the small (4.2 m long) SUV hasn\u2019t been the success which Hyundai had hoped for. A competitive vehicle, the main issue is really how crowded the segment is, especially in Europe. It is more or less a special model for the region, featuring there and in certain other countries instead of the Venue. Crossovers & SUVs: C & D segments A far better performer is the larger Kona. This distinctive looking SUV can be ordered with a petrol engine or in three electrified forms: MHEV, HEV or EV. The latest model was new in 2023 so next up will be a facelift in 2026 and a third generation in 2029, though it should be revealed in late 2028. Wearing an ix25 badge in China (where it has not been too successful) and Creta in India (where it has been), a more conservative looking 4.3 m long SUV is about to be complemented by yet another Hyundai EV. The Creta Electric is for the moment mainly targeted at the Indian market, where it will offer 42 kWh Standard or 51.4 kWh Long Range batteries. As the petrol model dates to 2019, replacements are due to be revealed in 2026. The EV\u2019s follow-up might not however be manufactured at HMIL\u2019s Chennai plant until 2027. Emboldened by having seen that Maruti Suzuki can be beaten - a Tata was the Indian market\u2019s best selling model in 2024 - Hyundai is developing a sub-Tucson model especially for that market. Due to be revealed in late 2026 and on sale in mid-2027, production of the Ni1i project will take place at the former General Motors Talagaon plant outside Pune. Insiders report that there will be up to seven seats, with powertrain choices including a hybrid option. Ioniq 5 to stay EV-only for second generation? Hugely popular worldwide, the Tucson is now well into the second half of what should be a six-year manufacturing plan. In fact, the next model is due in 2026 and there should again be HEV and PHEV powertrains as well as non-electrified alternatives for relevant markets. Looking now at an electric-only crossover, the Ioniq 5 has done a great deal of heavy lifting to shift Hyundai\u2019s image in multiple countries. It also continues to convert many an EV-sceptic and the high performance N variant has been deservedly acclaimed. The follow up is due in 2027 and should be based on an evolution of E-GMP, this model having debuted that platform in 2021. Length will likely remain around the 4.6 m long mark. Santa Fe to gain a range extender in 2026 One of Hyundai\u2019s best sellers at a global level is about to celebrate a quarter of a century of build, with generation five of the Santa Fe now a year into its production cycle. That means a mid-cycle refresh is scheduled for 2026 (plus an EREV powertrain) with a successor due in late 2028 or early 2029. Existing plants in South Korea, the USA and China should produce generation six. HMG\u2019s yet to be seen N4 platform should feature. Deliveries of the brand\u2019s newest SUV commenced earlier on 15 January, production of the second generation Palisade having started at a plant in Ulsan during December. This square-styled 5.1 m long SUV comes with the choice of 207 kW (281 PS) 2.5-litre turbo or 246 kW (334 PS) 2.5-litre turbo hybrid powertrains. While South Korea is the launch market, the US will also gain the new Palisade later in 2025 as a 26MY vehicle. The life cycle should be six years, a facelift being expected in 2028. Finally, the Ioniq 9, which is the same length as the Palisade but is an EV. Debuting at the LA auto show in November (2024), this big SUV has a standard 110.3 kWh battery and is manufactured at Asan in Korea\u2019s South Chungcheong province. It will also be made at the Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America (HMGMA) in Bryan County, Georgia commencing later in 2025. Production should endure for six, possibly seven years. Hydrogen Fuel Cell vehicle While others seem to have put FCEVs on the backburner, Hyundai Motor Group continues to champion them. Soon, we should see a successor for the Nexo in the form of a fresh fuel cell-powered SUV. Likely to be called Initium, it was previewed by a prototype of this same name last October (see image). Production is due to start in May with the first examples for the Korean market, to be followed by vehicles for the US and Canada as well as selected European countries. Planned annual production is an ambitious 30,000 units or roughly triple the Nexo's volume.
