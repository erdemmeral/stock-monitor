[{"text": "Bear of the Day: AT&T (T) David Bartosiak Wed, Jan 8, 2025, 7:07 PM 2 min read In This Article: T There was a time, not too long ago, when you could buy a mega cap stock with a solid divided and ignore it for decades. You knew the dividend check was always going to clear, and the company\u2019s Board of Directors was going to ensure growth of that dividend over time. Somewhere along the way, several of these stalwarts of industry slipped up along the way. Today\u2019s Bear of the Day belongs to one of those industry titans which has sort of slipped up over the last five years or so. I\u2019m talking about Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) AT&T ( T ). AT&T provides telecommunications and technology services worldwide. The company operates through two segments, Communications and Latin America.\u00a0The company is in the Wireless National industry which ranks in the Bottom 23% of our Zacks Industry Rank. The reason for the unfavorable Zacks Rank is that 4 analysts have cut their earnings expectations for the current year. What\u2019s worse is that 7 analysts have done so for next year. The bearish moves have cut the current year Zacks Consensus Estimate from $2.22 to $2.20 over the last 30 days, while next year\u2019s number is down from $2.34 to $2.14 over the last 90 days. The stock has been moving down since the start of December. It was nearly $24 then, and is off 10% since then. This is coming after a big move higher from lows of $14 in January of last year. Investors looking for other stocks within the industry that are in the good graces of our Zacks Rank have a couple of choices to investigate further. Cambium Networks ( CMBM ) and Cogent Communications ( CCOI ) are both Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks within the Wireless National industry. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Inc. (CCOI) The Best High Dividend Stocks Under $100? Vardah Gill Sun, Jan 26, 2025, 11:58 AM 8 min read In This Article: CCOI We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best High Dividend Stocks Under $100 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CCOI) stands against the other high dividend stocks under $100. Dividend stocks hold strong appeal for income generation for two main reasons. First, their regular payouts help investors address immediate liquidity needs. Second, historical trends indicate that dividend-paying stocks can help reduce market volatility and limit losses during downturns. Companies with a track record of dividend growth often provide added stability during bearish markets. For instance, between December 31, 1999, and March 31, 2022, during periods of market decline, the High Yield Dividend Aristocrats index outperformed the Composite 1500 and the High Dividend Index, delivering an average monthly outperformance of 140 and 49 basis points, respectively. Investing in dividend stocks has always been a tug-of-war between those favoring high yields and those backing dividend growth. Analysts suggest that due to economic volatility since 2020 and ongoing market uncertainties impacting corporate earnings, high-yield companies without strong financial stability and discipline may struggle to maintain their dividend payouts. This could leave them at risk of dividend cuts or suspensions. In contrast, dividend growth strategies have proven effective in both rising and falling interest rate environments. According to a report by ProShares, the Dividend Aristocrats index, which tracks companies with at least 25 years of consistent dividend growth, achieved a 14.26% return during the period of declining interest rates from May 2005 to March 2024, outperforming high-yield stocks, which delivered just over 10%. Similarly, during periods of rising interest rates within the same timeframe, dividend growth stocks returned 10.26%, compared to 9.22% for high-yield stocks.

While analysts warn investors about the financial stability of high-yield companies, these stocks have historically delivered solid returns. The research from The Wellington study analyzed the broader market\u2019s dividend-paying stocks from 1930 to 2019, dividing them into five categories based on their dividend yields. The top 20% of dividend payers outshone the rest, with the moderate dividend group also surpassing the broader market in several periods. However, stocks with lower dividend yields showed less consistent performance compared to the broader index. Story Continues Kirsten Cabacungan, an investment strategist at Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, encouraged investors to focus on both price appreciation and dividend income when evaluating total returns. She highlighted that dividend-paying stocks bring added advantages, as their steady income can help cushion losses during market downturns, offering stability to a portfolio. Moreover, during periods of low interest rates, these stocks often provide higher income compared to options like Treasury bonds, CDs, or corporate bonds. Here are some other comments from the analyst: \u201cCompanies that have consistently increased their dividends tend to be more stable, higher quality businesses, which historically have weathered downturns and are more likely to have the ability to pay dividends consistently.\u201d Cabacungan advised that investors looking for steady income might benefit from focusing on stocks with above-average dividend yields held over the long term. On the other hand, those prioritizing growth without the need for immediate income should consider stocks with a history of steadily increasing dividends. This strategy aligns with a growth-focused approach, enabling investors to capitalize on companies that consistently enhance their dividends as their profits and cash flows expand. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best high-yield stocks under $100. Our Methodology: For this list, we first used a stock screener to identify dividend-paying stocks priced below $100 and offering dividend yields above 4% as of January 24. From that selection, we chose 12 companies with strong dividend histories and ranked them in ascending order of hedge funds\u2019 sentiment toward them, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q4 2023. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ: CCOI ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27 Dividend Yield as of January 24: 5.26% Share Price as of January 24: $75.70 Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CCOI) is a Washington-based multinational internet service provider company that offers services related to internet access and data transport. The company is close to finalizing a major network overhaul that started over 18 months ago, focused on creating a custom-designed wavelength network. This extensive project has included substantial upgrades across its entire infrastructure to support efficient any-to-any data center connectivity. A key aspect of this transformation is the integration of a ROADM-enabled network at key metro hubs and regeneration points. These Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexers (ROADMs) automate the routing of long-distance data waves between metro regions, eliminating the need for manual adjustments. Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CCOI) is a strong investment option from a dividend point of view. The company maintains a solid financial position, with its trailing twelve-month levered free cash flow exceeding $101 million. During the latest quarter, it reported an operating cash flow of $52.4 million, marking a significant increase compared to $22.2 million in the same period last year. Alphyn Capital Management, in its Q3 2024 investor letter , also highlighted the company\u2019s strong performance in its core operations. Here is what the firm has to say: \u201cIn its latest earnings release, Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CCOI) reported steady, albeit unspectacular, performance in its core operations. There has been some progress on extracting cost synergies from the Sprint acquisition, and there is some potential for value creation through monetizing \u201chidden assets\u201d from its IPv4 and data center co-location fees. The company has made progress in realizing cost synergies from the spring acquisition and may unlock additional value by monetizing \u201chidden assets\u201d such as its IPv4 holdings and data center co-location fees. However, the crux of the investment thesis remains the potential for significant revenue growth from waves. Without this catalyst, I believe the stock could drop to the low $60s, but with waves revenues materializing, the upside potential could exceed $150. Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CCOI) currently offers a quarterly dividend of C$0.995 per share, having raised it by 1% in November 2024. This was the company's 49th consecutive quarter of dividend growth, which makes CCOI one of the best dividend stocks on our list. As of January 24, the stock has a dividend yield of 5.26%.

Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 8, 2025, 8:00 PM 3 min read In This Article: CCOI Cogent Communications (CCOI) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices. The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Cogent is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price. Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock. For Cogent, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher. Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>. Story Continues Earnings Estimate Revisions for Cogent For the fiscal year ending December 2024, this internet service provider is expected to earn -$4.57 per share, which is a change of -117.2% from the year-ago reported number. Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Cogent. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 21.1%. Bottom Line Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term. You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>> The upgrade of Cogent to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.

(CCOI): A Bull Case Theory Ricardo Pillai Thu, Jan 16, 2025, 9:44 PM 3 min read In This Article: CCOI We came across a bullish thesis on Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. (CCOI) on Twitter by Aaron Chan. In this article, we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on CCOI. Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. (CCOI)'s share was trading at $73.02 as of Jan 15 th . CCOI\u2019s trailing P/E was 105.83 according to Yahoo Finance. A technician installing high-speed internet cables. Cogent Communications (CCOI) is nearing the completion of a transformative network reconfiguration project that began over 18 months ago, aimed at constructing a purpose-built wavelength network. This initiative has involved significant enhancements across its entire footprint to enable seamless any-to-any data center connectivity. The pivotal element of this transformation is the deployment of a ROADM-enabled network across major metro hubs and regeneration sites. ROADMs (Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexers) automate long-haul wave routing between metro areas, eliminating the need for manual intervention. For instance, a customer requiring connectivity from Los Angeles to Atlanta can now rely on automated routing through intermediate hubs like Phoenix, El Paso, and Dallas, with ROADMs seamlessly directing traffic at each point. Combined with standardized Ciena RLS equipment, this allows for software-driven configuration, reducing manual effort, standardizing operations, and improving scalability. This network reconfiguration aligns with Cogent\u2019s broader strategy of building operationally and financially scalable infrastructure. By leveraging a standardized ecosystem of equipment, fiber, and OSS/BSS tools, Cogent has achieved lower fixed and marginal costs while improving service installation times. These advancements underpin its ability to deliver commodity-like services at scale, supported by an aggressive sales force. Cogent\u2019s model has already made it the largest carrier of internet traffic globally, and the company is now poised to disrupt the wavelength market with its latest innovation. Cogent\u2019s new network, combining Sprint\u2019s fiber assets with its extensive data center connectivity, offers unparalleled geographic ubiquity and physical diversity, with 90% of its routes running uniquely along railroads. Hyperscale companies, known for their rigorous testing and SLA requirements, have already committed significant capacity to Cogent\u2019s network, validating its reliability and performance. These companies often demand diverse paths and providers to ensure 99.999% uptime, a need Cogent\u2019s network is well-positioned to meet. With the wavelength network now fully operational and broadly available to customers for the first time, Cogent is entering a new phase of growth, targeting both route diversity for existing customers and disruptive opportunities in the market. Story Continues As Cogent markets this state-of-the-art network, 2025 is expected to be a breakthrough year, marked by a significant acceleration in its wavelength business. This initiative not only positions Cogent as a leader in the wavelength market but also sets the stage for substantial long-term growth and value creation. Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc.

Loss, Misses Revenue Estimates Zacks Equity Research Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 4:10 PM 3 min read In This Article: CCOI Cogent Communications (CCOI) came out with a quarterly loss of $1.33 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.34. This compares to loss of $1.13 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 0.75%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this internet service provider would post a loss of $1.31 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.75, delivering a surprise of 42.75%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. Cogent , which belongs to the Zacks Wireless National industry, posted revenues of $257.2 million for the quarter ended September 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.20%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $275.43 million. The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Cogent shares have added about 11.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 24.3%. What's Next for Cogent? While Cogent has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Cogent: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Communications Holdings Inc. (CCOI) the Best Telecom Stock to Invest In Now? Maham Fatima Sat, Dec 14, 2024, 3:09 AM 6 min read In This Article: CCOI We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Telecom Stocks To Invest In Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cogent Communications Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CCOI) stands against the other telecom stocks. The global telecom services market was valued at $1.80 trillion in 2022 and is projected to grow at a 6.2% compound annual growth rate through 2030, as reported by Grand View Research. This growth is driven by factors such as 5G infrastructure investments, a rising number of mobile subscribers, increasing demand for high-speed data, and the growing need for managed services. This industry has undergone a remarkable evolution since its inception. From early forms of communication like voice and basic visual signals transmitted over wired infrastructure, it has progressed to today's sophisticated landscape of exchanging audio, video, and text content across diverse wireless networks. This evolution is marked by advancements in data speeds, transitioning from early technologies like GSM and CDMA to 3G, and 4G, and now the commercialization of 5G, enabling rapid data transfer that was once unimaginable. According to Forbes, one of the driving forces for the telecom industry in 2025 will be the continued rollout and maturation of 5G technology. 5G will deliver faster speeds and improved connectivity and also unlock a new era of possibilities, such as enabling immersive experiences like VR/AR, powering advanced industrial applications, and driving innovation across a wide range of sectors. While 5G is currently being deployed, attention is shifting to 6G, which promises to deliver significantly enhanced capabilities. IDTechEx recently reported that 6G will revolutionize communication by operating in the terahertz (THz) spectrum. This will enable unprecedented data rates (Tbps) and ultra-low latency. Beyond speed, 6G will unlock new applications like energy harvesting and advanced sensing. To achieve this, 6G will utilize higher frequency bands (7-20 GHz, W-band, D-band) for both access and backhaul. However, higher frequencies present challenges like atmospheric absorption and interference. Overcoming these requires optimizing link budgets through advancements in semiconductor technology. While CMOS may suffice for lower frequencies, SiGe and InP technologies are crucial for higher frequencies. SiGe BiCMOS offers a good balance of performance and cost, while InP provides the highest performance. Furthermore, Antenna-in-Package (AiP) technology is vital for integrating antennas directly into semiconductor packages, crucial for high-frequency communication, particularly in the mmWave and sub-THz ranges.

An aerial view of an internet exchange point, illustrating the importance of an online service provider. Cogent Communications Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: CCOI ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27 Cogent Communications Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CCOI) is a leading provider of high-speed internet, private network, and colocation services. It caters primarily to bandwidth-intensive businesses, including law firms, financial institutions, and other professional services, as well as other internet service providers. Its services include on-net and off-net internet access, private network solutions, and data center colocation space. The earlier acquisition of Sprint Global Market's wireline business by Cogent Communications Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CCOI) helped the company achieve $165 million in cost savings, representing 75% of the targeted $220 million in annual cost reductions, as of Q3 2024. The acquisition has expanded its network reach through the integration of 43 acquired Sprint facilities, increasing the total data center count to 95. It also enabled the company to expand its service offerings to include optical wavelength services, which are now available in 200+ locations and are expected to expand to 800+ locations by the end of 2024. Cogent Communications Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CCOI) is well-positioned to capitalize on emerging market opportunities and solidify its position as a leading player in the telecom industry. Alphyn Capital Management stated the following regarding Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CCOI) in its Q3 2024 investor letter : \u201cIn its latest earnings release, Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CCOI) reported steady, albeit unspectacular, performance in its core operations. There has been some progress on extracting cost synergies from the Sprint acquisition, and there is some potential for value creation through monetizing \u201chidden assets\u201d from its IPv4 and data center co-location fees. The company has made progress in realizing cost synergies from the spring acquisition and may unlock additional value by monetizing \u201chidden assets\u201d such as its IPv4 holdings and data center co-location fees. However, the crux of the investment thesis remains the potential for significant revenue growth from waves. Without this catalyst, I believe the stock could drop to the low $60s, but with waves revenues materializing, the upside potential could exceed $150. Overall CCOI ranks 6th on our list of the best telecom stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of CCOI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CCOI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock .

Highlights Verizon, United States Cellular and Cogent Communications Zacks Equity Research Wed, Dec 18, 2024, 12:26 PM 9 min read In This Article: VZ USM ^GSPC CCOI For Immediate Release Chicago, IL \u2013 December 18, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, United States Cellular Corp. USM and Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. CCOI. Industry: Wireless Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2384391/3-wireless-stocks-likely-to-thrive-against-industry-odds The Zacks Wireless National industry appears to be mired in high capital expenditures for infrastructure upgrades, supply-chain disruptions amid the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war, Middle East tensions and high customer inventory levels. However, the industry is likely to benefit in the long run from an accelerated 5G rollout and increased fiber densification. Against this backdrop, Verizon Communications Inc. , United States Cellular Corp. and Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. are likely to gain from higher demand for scalable infrastructure for sustainable networks and innovations with a wide proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT), wireless traction and solid broadband momentum. Industry Description The Zacks Wireless National industry comprises nationwide wireless firms that provide a comprehensive range of communication services and business solutions. These include wireless, wireline, local exchange, long-distance calls, data/broadband and Internet, video, managed networking, messaging, wholesale and cloud-based services to retail consumers. The firms within the industry also offer IP-based voice and data services, targeted advertising, television, streaming content, cable networks and publishing operations, multiprotocol label switching networking, fiber optic long-haul networks and hosting and communications systems to businesses and government agencies. In addition, the firms provide edge computing services that allow businesses to route application-specific traffic where required and are most effective \u2014 whether in the cloud, the network, or on their premises. What's Shaping the Future of the Wireless National Industry? Margin Pressure, Waning Legacy Services: Increased infrastructure spending for network upgrades has largely compromised short-term margins. Aggressive promotional expenses, lucrative discounts and the adoption of several low-priced service plans to attract and retain customers are eroding profits. A steady decline in linear TV subscribers and legacy services due to a challenging macroeconomic environment and high inflation adds to the margin woes. Consequently, the industry firms are increasingly seeking diversification from legacy telecom services to more business, enterprise and wholesale opportunities. Story Continues Companies are making significant investments to upgrade their network and product portfolio, including considerable advances in software-defined, wide-area network capabilities and a new Cloud Core architecture, which is affecting their profitability. Thriving 5G & Fiber Ecosystem: Most industry participants are deploying the latest 4G LTE Advanced technologies to deliver higher peak data speeds and capacity, driven by customer-focused planning, disciplined engineering and investments for infrastructure upgrades. The companies are also expanding their fiber optic networks to support 4G LTE and 5G wireless standards. Further, leading firms within the industry have been deploying the C-Band spectrum to gain additional coverage. These mid-band airwaves offer significant bandwidth with better propagation characteristics for optimum coverage in rural and urban areas compared with mmWave. As the 5G ecosystem evolves, customers are expected to experience significant enhancements in coverage and speed. Inflated Raw Material Prices: High raw material prices due to the Middle East tensions, the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war and the consequent economic sanctions against the Putin regime have affected the operation schedule of various firms. The demand-supply imbalance has crippled operations and largely affected profitability due to inflated equipment prices. Wireless operators face challenges due to the disruptive rise of over-the-top service providers in this dynamic industry.

International Revenue Performance Explored Zacks Equity Research Mon, Nov 11, 2024, 5:15 PM 5 min read In This Article: CCOI Did you analyze how Cogent Communications (CCOI) fared in its international operations for the quarter ending September 2024? Given the widespread global presence of this internet service provider, scrutinizing the trends in international revenues becomes imperative to assess its financial strength and future growth possibilities. In the current global economy, which is more interconnected than ever, a company's success in penetrating international markets is crucial for its financial health and growth journey. Investors must understand a company's dependence on overseas markets, as this offers a window into the company's earnings stability, its ability to benefit from varied economic cycles and its potential for long-term growth. Presence in international markets can act as a hedge against domestic economic downturns and provide access to faster-growing economies. However, this diversification also brings complexities due to currency fluctuations, geopolitical risks and differing market dynamics. Our review of CCOI's last quarterly performance uncovered some notable trends in the revenue contributions from its international markets, which are commonly analyzed and tracked by Wall Street experts. For the quarter, the company's total revenue amounted to $257.2 million, experiencing a decline of 6.6% year over year. Next, we'll explore the breakdown of CCOI's international revenue to understand the importance of its overseas business operations. Trends in CCOI's Revenue from International Markets Africa generated $0.15 million in revenues for the company in the last quarter, constituting 0.06% of the total. This represented a surprise of -10% compared to the $0.17 million projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively, in the previous quarter, Africa accounted for $0.16 million (0.06%), and in the year-ago quarter, it contributed $0.19 million (0.07%) to the total revenue. Europe accounted for 11.39% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $29.3 million. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of +7.05%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $27.37 million. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, Europe contributed $28.47 million (10.93%) and $27.48 million (9.98%) to the total revenue, respectively. Of the total revenue, $5.71 million came from Oceania during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 2.22%. This represented a surprise of -0.11% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $5.72 million to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $5.67 million, or 2.18%, and $5.96 million, or 2.16%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively. Story Continues International Revenue Predictions Wall Street analysts expect Cogent to report a total revenue of $261.29 million in the current fiscal quarter, which suggests a decline of 4% from the prior-year quarter. Revenue shares from Africa, Europe and Oceania are predicted to be 0.1%, 10.7% and 2.2%, corresponding to amounts of $0.17 million, $27.95 million and $5.79 million, respectively. For the full year, the company is projected to achieve a total revenue of $1.05 billion, which signifies a rise of 11.5% from the last year. The share of this revenue from various regions is expected to be: Africa at 0.1% ($0.69 million), Europe at 10.8% ($112.88 million) and Oceania at 2.2% ($23.16 million). Wrapping Up Relying on global markets for revenues presents both prospects and challenges for Cogent. Therefore, scrutinizing its international revenue trends is key to effectively forecasting the company's future outlook. In an era of growing international ties and escalating geopolitical disputes, financial analysts on Wall Street pay keen attention to these developments to fine-tune their earnings estimations for businesses operating across borders. It's important to note, however, that a range of additional variables, like a company's local market status, also play a crucial role in shaping these forecasts. At Zacks, we place significant importance on a company's evolving earnings outlook. This is based on empirical evidence demonstrating its strong influence on a stock's short -term price movements. Invariably, there exists a positive relationship -- an upward revision in earnings estimates is typically mirrored by a rise in the stock price. The Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool, comes with an externally validated impressive track record. It effectively utilizes shifts in earnings projections to act as a dependable barometer for forecasting short-term stock price trends. At present, Cogent holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). This ranking implies that its near-term performance might underperform the overall market movement.

Wireless Stocks Likely to Thrive Against Industry Odds Supriyo Bose Tue, Dec 17, 2024, 5:01 PM 7 min read In This Article: ^GSPC VZ USM The Zacks Wireless National industry appears to be mired in high capital expenditures for infrastructure upgrades, supply-chain disruptions amid the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war, Middle East tensions and high customer inventory levels. However, the industry is likely to benefit in the long run from an accelerated 5G rollout and increased fiber densification. Against this backdrop, Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, United States Cellular Corporation USM and Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc. CCOI are likely to gain from higher demand for scalable infrastructure for sustainable networks and innovations with a wide proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT), wireless traction and solid broadband momentum. Industry Description The Zacks Wireless National industry comprises nationwide wireless firms that provide a comprehensive range of communication services and business solutions. These include wireless, wireline, local exchange, long-distance calls, data/broadband and Internet, video, managed networking, messaging, wholesale and cloud-based services to retail consumers. The firms within the industry also offer IP-based voice and data services, targeted advertising, television, streaming content, cable networks and publishing operations, multiprotocol label switching networking, fiber optic long-haul networks and hosting and communications systems to businesses and government agencies. In addition, the firms provide edge computing services that allow businesses to route application-specific traffic where required and are most effective \u2014 whether in the cloud, the network, or on their premises. What's Shaping the Future of the Wireless National Industry? Margin Pressure, Waning Legacy Services: Increased infrastructure spending for network upgrades has largely compromised short-term margins. Aggressive promotional expenses, lucrative discounts and the adoption of several low-priced service plans to attract and retain customers are eroding profits. A steady decline in linear TV subscribers and legacy services due to a challenging macroeconomic environment and high inflation adds to the margin woes. Consequently, the industry firms are increasingly seeking diversification from legacy telecom services to more business, enterprise and wholesale opportunities. Companies are making significant investments to upgrade their network and product portfolio, including considerable advances in software-defined, wide-area network capabilities and a new Cloud Core architecture, which is affecting their profitability. Thriving 5G & Fiber Ecosystem: Most industry participants are deploying the latest 4G LTE Advanced technologies to deliver higher peak data speeds and capacity, driven by customer-focused planning, disciplined engineering and investments for infrastructure upgrades. The companies are also expanding their fiber optic networks to support 4G LTE and 5G wireless standards. Further, leading firms within the industry have been deploying the C-Band spectrum to gain additional coverage. These mid-band airwaves offer significant bandwidth with better propagation characteristics for optimum coverage in rural and urban areas compared with mmWave. As the 5G ecosystem evolves, customers are expected to experience significant enhancements in coverage and speed. Inflated Raw Material Prices: High raw material prices due to the Middle East tensions, the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war and the consequent economic sanctions against the Putin regime have affected the operation schedule of various firms. The demand-supply imbalance has crippled operations and largely affected profitability due to inflated equipment prices. Wireless operators face challenges due to the disruptive rise of over-the-top service providers in this dynamic industry. Price-sensitive competition for customer retention in the core business is expected to intensify in the coming days. Aggressive competition is likely to limit the ability to attract and retain customers, affecting operating and financial results. Network Simplification and Rationalization: The industry participants are realigning their wireless network toward a software-centric model to cater to increasing business demands and customer needs through remote facilities. The industry players focus on improving operational efficiencies through network simplification and rationalization, thereby boosting end-to-end provisioning time and driving standardization. Moreover, the firms are offering a variety of pathways for delivering services through a combination of network-based video transcoding, packaging, storage and compression technologies to offer new IP video formats, live TV, streaming services and home gateways to connected devices inside and outside the home.
