Wire Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 5:00 PM 5 min read In This Article: ENVB -13.40% Dose-proportional oral bioavailability without clinical signs, including those associated with hallucinogenic compounds, was demonstrated in rat and dog pharmacokinetic (PK) studies while significant brain penetration was observed in rat CAMBRIDGE, Mass., November 25, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Enveric Biosciences , Inc. (NASDAQ: ENVB) (\"Enveric\" or the \"Company\"), a biotechnology company dedicated to the development of novel neuroplastogen small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric disorders, today announced the completion of preclinical pharmacokinetic (\"PK\") studies in rat and dog further supporting the oral bioavailability and targeted non-hallucinogenic profile of EB-003. The PK studies demonstrated oral bioavailability in rat and dog studies that was dose-proportional, as was also shown previously in a mouse model. No clinical signs, including those associated with hallucination, were observed in either study. For example, in dogs, ataxia and vocalization were not observed. Additionally, significant brain penetration was demonstrated in the rat model with a brain/plasma ratio of about 5-6, which is significantly higher than was seen in the mouse model (~1.5). This increased brain/plasma ratio could translate to enhanced efficacy, lower doses, and less off-target side effects if these findings are confirmed in clinical trials. \"Completion of these animal PK studies further supports our efforts to develop conveniently delivered, orally-available drugs with the potential to harness neuroplastic properties without inducing hallucinations,\" said Joseph Tucker, Ph.D., CEO of Enveric. \"The additional data gained in these animal studies enhances our understanding of the preclinical profile of this drug candidate and brings us a step closer to finalizing the data package for the EB-003 Investigational New Drug (IND) application, which we anticipate submitting to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the second half of 2025.\" \"Mental health disorders like depression and anxiety are on the rise, with approximately one billion people globally expected to experience a neuropsychiatric disorder at some time in their lives 1 . Despite the prevalence of these conditions, currently approved treatments fail to provide adequate relief for half of the patients who try them, resulting in widespread challenges to the psychiatric community 2 . The market opportunity for neuroplastogens is estimated to exceed $35 billion by 2030, with the potential to offer low side-effects, strong efficacy, and potential synergies with current drugs, which could help drive demand for new and innovative treatment options 3 .\" Story Continues World Health Organization, \"Mental Health and Substance Use,\" accessed November 20 2024, https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-psychiatric-sciences/article/changing-trends-in-the-global-burden-of-mental-disorders-from-1990-to-2019-and-predicted-levels-in-25-years/57DCF2F39E8DC9DD19250C1CE95C24F8?utm David J.

{"text": "Enveric Biosciences Announces New U.S. Patents Supporting EVM301 Series and EVM201 Series Compounds Business Wire Mon, Dec 2, 2024, 4:00 PM 6 min read In This Article: ENVB -13.40% New patents provide additional composition of matter and methods of use claims for Enveric\u2019s EVM301 series neuroplastogenic molecules, and recently out-licensed tryptamine-derived prodrugs, including EB-002, a new chemical entity psilocin prodrug CAMBRIDGE, Mass., December 02, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Enveric Biosciences (NASDAQ: ENVB) (\"Enveric\" or the \"Company\"), a biotechnology company dedicated to the development of novel neuroplastogenic small-molecule therapeutics for the treatment of anxiety, depression, and addiction disorders, today announced that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has issued two U.S. Patents, Nos. 12,133,856 (the \u2018856 patent) and 12,138,276,(the \u2018276 patent) bringing the total number of issued patents supporting its EVM301 series molecules to 11. The claims of the \u2018856 patent and the \u2018276 patent expand the range of protection for novel, non-obvious multi-substituent and halogenated psilocybin derivative compounds and pharmaceutical formulations containing such compounds, respectively. Enveric\u2019s EB-003 compound emerged as Enveric\u2019s lead candidate from its EVM301 series of molecules and was generated from its molecular library, Psybrary\u2122, a proprietary catalogue of over 1,000 tryptamine derivatives that incorporates receptor engagement and functional data to correlate structure with biological activity. EB-003 is intended to target anxiety, depression, and addiction disorders. Recent announcements have highlighted the promising pre-clinical data demonstrating the potential for the EB-003 compound to promote neuroplasticity and be orally administered at doses believed to be efficacious without hallucinogenic effect, both of which we believe to be key criteria of commercial and regulatory interest. In addition, Enveric announced that the USPTO has issued two other U.S. Patents, No. 12,065,404 (the \u2018404 patent) and 12,077,498 (the \u2019498 patent), related to its EVM201 series prodrug molecules. The claims of the \u2018404 patent and \u2018498 patent protect novel, non-obvious C4-carboxylic acid-substituted tryptamine derivative compounds and pharmaceutical drug formulations containing such compounds, and methods of making such compounds, respectively. These compounds are prodrugs intended to treat neurological disorders. Enveric recently announced that it licensed its EVM201 Series to MycoMedica Life Sciences (MycoMedica). These additional patents strengthen and underscore the potential value to Enveric and MycoMedica, which plans to develop the lead EVM201 Series compound EB-002. Story Continues \"These patent issuances from the USPTO add important pillars to Enveric\u2019s intellectual property portfolio as we continue to distinguish the pre-clinical performance of our tryptamine-based molecules under development for the treatment of mental health disorders from others on the market or under development,\" said Joseph Tucker, Ph.D., Director and CEO of Enveric. \"Importantly, with our focus squarely on our EVM301 Series, we expect to continue uncovering positive data highlighting the promising properties of EB-003, which is designed to capitalize on the potential for inducing neuroplasticity without causing hallucinations that can meet key commercial and regulatory criteria to advance to clinical trials.\" Enveric has announced out-licensing deals with MycoMedica and Aries Science & Technology, which positions Enveric to focus its resources on development of its lead compound EB-003. These deals establish potential future income streams to support the development and commercialization of Enveric\u2019s pipeline candidates. About Enveric Biosciences Enveric Biosciences (NASDAQ: ENVB) is a biotechnology company dedicated to the development of novel neuroplastogenic small-molecule therapeutics for the treatment of depression, anxiety, and addiction disorders. Leveraging its unique discovery and development platform, Psybrary\u2122, Enveric has created a robust intellectual property portfolio of new chemical entities for specific mental health indications. Enveric\u2019s lead molecule, EB-003, is a potential first-in-class neuroplastogen designed to promote neuroplasticity, without inducing hallucinations, in patients suffering from difficult-to-address mental health disorders.

-13.40% Agreement includes development and sales milestones payments potentially totaling up to $62 million as well as tiered single digit royalties on future sales CAMBRIDGE, Mass., November 12, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Enveric Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: ENVB) (\"Enveric\" or the \"Company\"), a biotechnology company dedicated to the development of novel neuroplastogen small-molecule therapeutics for the treatment of depression, anxiety, and addiction disorders, today announced that the Company has executed a licensing agreement with MycoMedica Life Sciences, out-licensing the Company\u2019s EVM201 program, including drug candidate EB-002. Pursuant to the terms of licensing agreement, MycoMedica will seek to develop EB-002, formerly EB-373, a synthetic prodrug of the active metabolite psilocin, in treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression. MycoMedica will receive an exclusive, global license to the formulations, drugs, method of use, and medical devices developed by Enveric to utilize the compound. MycoMedica would assume responsibility for all future preclinical, clinical, and commercial development on a royalty-bearing basis for all human and animal pharmaceutical applications. As part of the license agreement, if certain conditions are met, Enveric is eligible to receive upfront, development, and sales milestones potentially totaling up to $62 million, plus tiered single digit royalties on all future sales. The license grants sublicensing rights and cash buyout options to MycoMedica. Enveric has established a strong foundation of intellectual property supporting the value potential for the EVM201 program, including EB-002, with numerous patents issued in the U.S. and applied for internationally. \"Given Enveric\u2019s strategic decision to prioritize EB-003, our novel, non-hallucinogenic neuroplastogen drug candidate, we have entered into a definitive license agreement with MycoMedica to out-license EB-002 with modest upfront payments that allow the EB-002 technology to move forward, followed by potentially transformational milestone and royalty payments. Doing so enables Enveric to fully allocate its operations and development resources to the advancement of EB-003, while creating excellent potential for realization of longer-term revenue from EB-002,\" said Joseph Tucker, Ph.D., CEO of Enveric. \"We are excited to enter into this licensing agreement with Enveric and continue the development of EB-002 as we seek to advance new treatment options for patients with neuropsychiatric disorders,\" said Sanjay Dub\u00e9 M.D., MycoMedica\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Medical Officer.

and research for lead candidate, EB-003, a novel neuroplastogenic molecule designed to treat severe mental health disorders Announced the expansion of patent protection for a broad range of molecules in its EVM301 portfolio, including five previously unannounced US patents Out-licensed patented radiation dermatitis topical product to Aries Science & Technology Out-licensed EVM201 Program including EB-002 Candidate to MycoMedica Life Sciences CAMBRIDGE, Mass., November 14, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Enveric Biosciences (NASDAQ: ENVB) (\"Enveric\" or the \"Company\"), a biotechnology company dedicated to the development of novel neuroplastogenic small-molecule therapeutics for the treatment of depression, anxiety, and addiction disorders, today provided a corporate update and reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \"The third quarter of 2024 was highlighted by important progress in the development of EB-003, our neuroplastogenic molecule that is designed to address difficult-to-treat mental health disorders without inducing the hallucinogenic effect common to N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and related analogs,\" said Joseph Tucker, Ph.D., Director and CEO of Enveric. \"Among the key achievements, data confirmed that EB-003 has the potential to be delivered via oral administration and penetrate the brain at levels expected to elicit the desired therapeutic effect. Additionally, preclinical safety and pharmacology studies confirmed that EB-003 targets desired serotonergic receptors while minimizing potentially harmful, off-target interactions common to serotonin-like drug compounds. These are clear differentiators for EB-003, which we believe will add to its value potential.\" Dr. Tucker added: \"Since the June FDA Advisory Committee hearing that raised numerous questions around the potential to approve MDMA for post-traumatic stress disorder, Enveric helped lead the discussion for how neuroplastogens with no or limited hallucinogenic effects might safely progress through clinical trials and gain approval for these patients in need while avoiding the challenges and complexities inherent to running trials with hallucination-inducing compounds. We chose to focus Enveric\u2019s AI-backed drug development platform on reducing and removing hallucinations for our various candidates to mitigate these challenges during clinical development and to reduce barriers to wide adoption by physicians post approval.\" Dr. Tucker continued: \"In our opinion, drug technologies that minimize or eliminate the hallucinogenic effect in molecules targeting the 5-HT2A receptor have the potential to become the gold standard in one or more neuropsychiatric indications, given the advantages such compounds would offer, including the ability to conduct truly blinded placebo-controlled clinical trials and the potential to administer the therapy in an outpatient setting without psychotherapy support. Recognizing this, we are working to finalize the data package for the EB-003 Investigational New Drug (IND) application, which we anticipate submitting to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the second half of 2025.\" Story Continues Dr. Tucker concluded: \"In parallel with our EB-003 development efforts, Enveric continues to seek to identify opportunities to secure out-licensing agreements for our other proprietary drug candidates. On this front, we were pleased to enter into separate licensing agreements with Aries Science & Technology and MycoMedica Life Sciences, and we anticipate announcing additional agreements over the coming months. These agreements not only validate the Company\u2019s platform but also generate non-dilutive revenue to support the development of EB-003 and further building stockholder value.\" THIRD QUARTER AND RECENT UPDATES Corporate, Product and Business Development Highlights: Confirmed oral bioavailability and significant brain exposure in preclinical studies of EB-003, supporting expedited development with IND filing and first patient dosed expected in 2025 Announced positive results from preclinical safety and pharmacology studies of EB-003, confirming the drug\u2019s selective activity with desired serotonergic neuroreceptors and ability to minimize potential adverse cardiovascular and CNS events Presented foundational research involving EB-003 at the 7 th Neuropsychiatric Drug Summit and the European Behavioral Pharmacology Society Biennial Workshop Strengthened intellectual property estate for EVM301 portfolio and announced the issuance of five additional U.S. patents Executed licensing agreement with Aries Science & Technology to clinically develop and market Enveric\u2019s patented product for radiation dermatitis Executed licensing agreement with MycoMedica Life Sciences to clinically develop and market Enveric\u2019s EB-002 drug candidate THIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS Net loss attributable to stockholders was $2.1 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, including $0.5 million in net non-cash expense, with a basic and diluted loss per share of $0.24, as compared to a net loss of $2.8 million, including $0.2 million in net non-cash income, with a basic and diluted loss per share of $1.30 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.
