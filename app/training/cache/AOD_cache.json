Rapper Laylow, Merged Design With Hip-hop Culture Sofia Celeste Thu, Dec 26, 2024, 7:16 PM 5 min read MILAN \u2014 French-born visual artist and a key character on the trap world, Osman Mercan has crossed the Rubicon from the world of music to the world of design. This month Osman debuted his own design studio, Age of Digital, unveiling its first chair. In 2015, the self-taught visual artist established a video production company, which set out to create its own disruptive aesthetic. For 13 years the 33-year-old has been the artistic director for Laylow, a French trap artist. He\u2019s now leveraging his directorial eye to create otherworldly pieces inspired by digital art. His first aluminum furniture piece was created with a 3D tool that is normally used in film. More from WWD The Most Famous Debutante Balls of All Time The Six Biggest Breakout Stars of 2024 Camila Cabello Goes Backless in Bejeweled Georges Hobeika Gown for Jingle Ball 2024 Red Carpet in Miami In an interview, Osman explained why he has made a foray into the world of design. WWD:\u00a0You entered the world of visual arts without any formal training \u2014 who were your mentors and how did you teach yourself the trade? Osman Mercan: I have always been passionate about cinema, fascinated by how movies are made. Over the years I have spent days at the Film Library Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut in Les Halles [France]. Every time I discovered a film, I would analyze it in-depth, try to deconstruct it,\u00a0through articles, decoding videos on YouTube, as well as by reading essays and reviews. What interested me most was how to create and tell stories through the moving image. The Chair by Age of Digital by Osman Mercan. WWD:\u00a0Is this your first furniture piece ever ? Do you have other designs that were more experimental? O.M.: This is my first real piece of furniture.\u00a0Before I started on this project, while working as the artistic director for Laylow, I was already creating original environments for his videos and onstage at concerts. Then when I started to develop the chair, the idea was to conceive a decor for larger scenes \u2014 starting with the chair and then adding other elements, which are in progress. WWD: \u00a0What is the next step? Design shows? Galleries? O.M.: This coming year will be punctuated by different drops, each time including an object along with ready-to-wear. This first chapter of AOD will definitely involve an event where people can discover the complete decor.\u00a0More broadly, I am building a bridge between design and hip-hop culture\u00a0in order to attract a greater number of people in these disciplines and to encourage the engagement of an already curious community. WWD: How do the worlds of music, rap, intertwine with the world of design? O.M.: There\u2019s a bridge across the creation of props and objects that create a visual universe within these musical worlds (videos, concerts), since aesthetic codes are an integral part of hip-hop. Personally, I think it\u2019s important to establish who you are and what your visual world looks like in order to really dive into the world of design. Story Continues WWD: Do you actively do both visual art for the trap music industry and design, or has one sacrificed for the other and how? O.M.: It\u2019s entirely possible to do both as one inspires the other \u2014 they speak to each other, challenge each other and feed each other.\u00a0Rather than sacrificing each other, they complement each other, allowing for the development of a more harmonious and stimulating artistic universe. WWD: Kanye West\u2019s circle gave birth to a fashion meets design zeitgeist, which included Virgil Abloh and would later include Samuel Ross , who crossed over to the design world from fashion. How are your endeavors different or similar? O.M.: Kanye and Virgil have been very inspiring \u2014 they confirmed to our generation that it is possible to be yourself and that you can stay true to your values. Getting outside of my comfort zone was my starting point and how I began to reflect on this project. I always loved the concept of the director Marcio Kogan , who became an architect and created each house thinking about the decor as though it were a set. The scale, the planning \u2014 everything was conceived to appear perfect in the image. I love the idea of merging skills to arrive at something hybrid that overturns the rules while injecting a sense of spontaneity. WWD:\u00a0I saw the AOD video \u2014 likening the production and molding of the chair to the relationship between fire and ice and rebirth. What does this all signify for you? O.M.: The video is a fictional representation of the fantastical process of creation. Since I come from the world of video, I wanted to use this medium to communicate about the chair. The idea was that I would be a sculptor who almost tears away at this material with a lot of spontaneity \u2014 and without even knowing the outcome. This video is the first expression of AOD and for which everything is possible. That fact that the video about the making of a design object could generate 600,000 views in just 24 hours confirms the idea that these kids understand the subject \u2014 that design arouses their interest. So we are defeating the elitist side of design. WWD:\u00a0When did you have the epiphany to jump from music to design? O.M.: In 2021, I ended a big chapter of my career with the project \u201cThe Strange Story of Mr. Anderson,\u201d a short film of the album, the video clips and the concert set design for Laylow, the artist and friend with whom I work as artistic director. During this project I realized objects and d\u00e9cor. When it was all over, I really wanted to immerse myself completely in the design world \u2014 to understand the different techniques and master the processes from A to Z. I wanted to understand the subtlety and efficiency to tell even better those stories that people could discover. Sign up for WWD's Newsletter .

Each Fund's distribution policy is subject to modification by the respective Board of Directors/Trustees at any time, and there can be no guarantee that the policy will continue. You should not draw any conclusions about any of these Funds' investment performance from the amount of the distributions. MANAGED DISTRIBUTION POLICY FUNDS ANNOUNCE DISTRIBUTION PAYMENT DETAILS abrdn Global Infrastructure Income Fund (\"ASGI\") abrdn Healthcare Opportunities Fund (\"THQ\") The above-noted abrdn U.S. Closed-End Funds (the \"Funds\" or individually the \"Fund\"), today announced that the Funds will pay the distributions noted in the chart above on January 31, 2025 to all shareholders of record as of January 24, 2025 (ex-dividend date January 24, 2025). Each Fund has adopted a distribution policy to provide investors with a stable distribution out of current income, supplemented by realized capital gains and, to the extent necessary, paid-in capital in reliance on an exemptive order granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under applicable U.S. tax rules, the amount and character of distributable income for each Fund's fiscal year can be finally determined only as of the end of the Fund's fiscal year. However, under Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\") and related rules, the Funds may be required to indicate to shareholders the estimated source of certain distributions to shareholders. Story Continues The following tables set forth the estimated amounts of the sources of the distributions for purposes of Section 19 of the 1940 Act and the rules adopted thereunder. The tables have been computed based on generally accepted accounting principles. The tables include estimated amounts and percentages for the current distributions to be paid as well as for the cumulative distributions paid relating to fiscal year to date, from the following sources: net investment income; net realized short-term capital gains; net realized long-term capital gains; and return of capital. The estimated compositions of the distributions may vary because the estimated composition may be impacted by future income, expenses and realized gains and losses on securities and currencies. The Funds' estimated sources of the current distributions to be paid and for its current fiscal year to date are as follows: Estimated Amounts of Current Distribution per Share Fund Distribution Amount Net Investment Income Net Realized Short-Term Gains* Net Realized Long-Term Gains Return of Capital ASGI $0.2000 $0.0080 4% $0.0020 1% $0.0820 41% $0.1080 54% THQ $0.1800 - - - - - - $0.1800 100% Estimated Amounts of Fiscal Year to Date Cumulative Distributions per Share Fund Fiscal Year** to Date Distribution Amount Net Investment Income Net Realized Short-Term Gains* Net Realized Long-Term Gains Return of Capital ASGI $0.8200 $0.0328 4% $0.0082 1% $0.3362 41% $0.4428 54% THQ $0.7200 - - - - - - $0.7200 100% * includes currency gains ** ASGI and THQ have a 9/30 fiscal year end. Where the estimated amounts above show a portion of the distribution to be a \"Return of Capital,\" it means that Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur for example, when some or all the money that you invested in a Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with \"yield\" or \"income.\" As of January 2, 2025, after giving effect to this payment ASGI estimates it has a net deficit of $29,396,000. A net deficit results when the Fund has net unrealized losses that are in excess of any net realized gains that have not yet been distributed. The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source of all distributions for the current year will only be made after year-end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. After the end of each calendar year, a Form 1099-DIV will be sent to shareholders for the prior calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. The following table provides the Funds' total return performance based on net asset value (NAV) over various time periods compared to the Funds' annualized and cumulative distribution rates. Fund Performance and Distribution Rate Information Fund Average Annual Total Return on NAV for the 5 Year Period Ending 12/31/2024\u00b9 Current Fiscal Period's Annualized Distribution Rate on NAV\u00b2 Cumulative Total Return on NAV\u00b9 Cumulative Distribution Rate on NAV\u00b2 ASGI 3 7.36% 3 12.60% -6.65% 3.19% THQ 6.73% 10.84% -10.35% 2.71% 1 Return data is net of all fund expenses and fees and assumes the reinvestment of all distributions reinvested at prices obtained under the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan, with the exception of the most recent distribution. 2 Based on the Fund's NAV as of December 31, 2024. 3 The Fund launched within the past 5 years; the performance and distribution rate information presented reflects data from inception (July 29, 2020) through December 31, 2024. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about a Fund's investment performance from the amount of the Fund's current distributions or from the terms of the distribution policy (the \"Distribution Policy\"). While NAV performance may be indicative of the Fund's investment performance, it does not measure the value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund. The value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund is determined by the Fund's market price, which is based on the supply and demand for the Fund's shares in the open market. Pursuant to an exemptive order granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Funds may distribute any long-term capital gains more frequently than the limits provided in Section 19(b) under the 1940 Act and Rule 19b-1 thereunder. Therefore, distributions paid by the Funds during the year may include net income, short-term capital gains, long-term capital gains and/or a return of capital. Net income dividends and short-term capital gain dividends, while generally taxable at ordinary income rates, may be eligible, to the extent of qualified dividend income earned by the Funds, to be taxed at a lower rate not to exceed the maximum rate applicable to your long-term capital gains. Distributions made in any calendar year in excess of investment company taxable income and net capital gain are treated as taxable ordinary dividends to the extent of undistributed earnings and profits, and then as a return of capital that reduces the adjusted basis in the shares held. To the extent return of capital distributions exceed the adjusted basis in the shares held, capital gain is recognized with a holding period based on the period the shares have been held at the date such amount is received. The payment of distributions in accordance with the Distribution Policy may result in a decrease in the Fund's net assets. A decrease in the Fund's net assets may cause an increase in the Fund's annual operating expense ratio and a decrease in the Fund's market price per share to the extent the market price correlates closely to the Fund's net asset value per share. The Distribution Policy may also negatively affect the Fund's investment activities to the extent that the Fund is required to hold larger cash positions than it typically would hold or to the extent that the Fund must liquidate securities that it would not have sold, for the purpose of paying the distribution. Each Fund's Board has the right to amend, suspend or terminate the Distribution Policy at any time. The amendment, suspension or termination of the Distribution Policy may affect the Fund's market price per share. Investors should consult their tax advisor regarding federal, state, and local tax considerations that may be applicable in their particular circumstances.

the highly-anticipated 77-inch LG SIGNATURE OLED T, LG's world-first transparent OLED TV with True Wireless Video & Audio Transfer. The groundbreaking TV is now available at select LG-authorized retailers including Best Buy, Video & Audio Center and via LG.com with an SRP of $59,999 . Availability in additional markets will be announced at a later date. LG Electronics (LG) announced the U.S. launch and immediate availability of the highly-anticipated 77-inch LG SIGNATURE OLED T, LG\u2019s world-first transparent OLED TV with True Wireless Video & Audio Transfer. The LG SIGNATURE OLED T will be demonstrated later this evening at a gala at Video & Audio Center in Century City where the first-ever purchase will be made.\u00a0 Unveiled at CES \u00ae 2024, the LG OLED T has received numerous honors including the coveted CES \"Best of Innovation\" award and was recently recognized by TIME as one of the \"Best Inventions of 2024.\" The LG SIGNATURE OLED T represents a monumental leap in both technology and design innovation, reflecting LG's relentless drive to delivering new and better . Its cutting-edge self-lit screen can transform from transparent to opaque; a unique ability that provides the OLED viewing experience while offering greater freedom in living space. Users can effortlessly switch between transparent and opaque modes at the touch of a button, unlocking unique possibilities for entertainment and space design. When in transparent mode, the OLED T offers a futuristic content experience that must be seen to be believed. The screen not only creates the illusion of content floating in mid-air but also produces a mesmerizing effect by \"merging\" the on-screen visuals with the surrounding space. LG OLED T further elevates the user experience with a suite of versatile features that optimally leverage the unique advantages of a transparent OLED screen, enhancing its distinctive value. One standout feature is T- Objet , an Always-On-Display (AOD) mode that transforms the screen into a transparent digital canvas, ideal for showcasing artwork, videos or photos in outstanding color and clarity. Complementing this is T-Bar, a sleek info-ticker that appears along the bottom edge of the screen, providing sports results, IoT device statuses, weather forecasts or song title information. The rest of the screen remains unused when T-Bar is active, presenting a clean, uncluttered look and a clear view of the space behind LG's \"virtually invisible\" display. For added convenience, T-Home offers a user-friendly interface that delivers a well-organized overview of available services, as well as quick access to apps, settings and other features. Story Continues Despite its stunning 77-inch screen size, the LG OLED T enhances the feeling of space within a room, providing a sense of openness that conventional TVs simply cannot. Its transparency allows it to be placed centrally without being obtrusive or positioned in front of windows without blocking natural light or views of the outdoors. The transparent 4K OLED screen, combined with LG's true wireless video and audio transmission technology, promises not only the aesthetic value but also an enhanced home entertainment experience. Free from tangled cables, the device delivers an immersive, distraction-free viewing environment. The OLED T advances innovation with LG's proprietary Zero Connect Box, a visually lossless wireless video and audio transmission solution* without latency ensuring a seamless viewing experience. By supporting 4K at 120Hz variable refresh rate, OLED T has been certified by NVIDIA G-SYNC \u00ae Compatible and AMD FreeSync Premium to eliminate tearing and stuttering for the most dynamic, true-to-life gaming experience. The LG SIGNATURE OLED T carries forward LG's legacy of providing superior picture quality and immersive viewing experiences \u2013 hallmarks of LG OLED TVs since the very first model hit the market in 2013. Building on over a decade of OLED innovation, LG's one-of-a-kind TV brings images fully to life with vibrant, precisely reproduced colors and incredible contrast. Powered by LG's advanced \u03b1 (Alpha) 11 AI processor, the OLED T intelligently optimizes both picture and sound quality, delivering unparalleled visual and auditory experiences. \"LG SIGNATURE OLED T is an exceptional user-focused innovation that offers a distinctive, multi-faceted viewing experience and unprecedented spatial flexibility,\" said Park Hyoung -sei, president of the LG Media Entertainment Solution Company. \"LG remains at the forefront of innovation by combining its industry-leading OLED technology with unique form factors, transparent screens, wireless connectivity and more, delivering unparalleled, life-enriching advancements no other TV maker can replicate.\" * Wireless transmission refers to the transferring of video and audio signals between a TV screen and the Zero Connect Box. Visually lossless, based on internal test results with ISO/IEC 29170-2 and measurement results may vary depending on connection status.

has removed a helpful lock screen feature from its One UI 7 beta Bryan M. Wolfe Tue, Dec 10, 2024, 6:25 PM 2 min read Support for lock screen widgets may soon come to an end on Samsung devices. As discovered by a Reddit user (via Android Authority ), this feature is missing in the latest One UI 7 beta version . If this change is carried over into the first public release of One UI 7, it would align Samsung\u2019s customized user interface more closely with Google Android, which removed native support for lock screen widgets starting with Android 5.0 Lollipop. Currently, in One UI 6, Samsung users can add full-size widgets to a dedicated carousel on the lock screen by tapping the clock. This carousel exists alongside mini widgets that can also be used. However, in the current One UI 7 beta, users can only utilize mini widgets, as the carousel feature has been removed. Before the One UI 7 beta, you could find information about lock screen widgets by navigating to Settings > Lock screen and AOD . In One UI 6.1.1 and earlier versions, this section allowed you to \u201cchoose useful information to display when you tap the clock on the lock screen.\u201d From here, it presented a list of full-size widgets such as Weather, Calendar, and Digital Wellbeing. Lock screen widgets in One UI 6.1.1 Android Authority After months of development, One UI 7 is anticipated to launch alongside Android 15 with Samsung\u2019s upcoming Galaxy S25 lineup . This new user interface will first be available on the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra, which the company is expected to announce next month. Following that, it will be rolled out to existing devices, including the company\u2019s current flagship, the Galaxy S24 Ultra . Interestingly, while Samsung may remove full-size lock screen widgets on One UI 7, Google may re-add them in Android. They were a part of Android 15 QPR1 and have been carried over to Android 15 QPR2 \u2014 at least for tablets.

What's that going into the former Masonic Building on G.E. Patterson in Downtown Memphis? Neil Strebig, Memphis Commercial Appeal Mon, Dec 16, 2024, 2:02 PM 2 min read If you've come Downtown lately, you might have noticed some construction near Central BBQ and the National Civil Rights Museum at the former Masonic Building Association site on G.E. Patterson Avenue. The historic building, located at 154 G.E. Patterson Ave., dates back to the early 1900s. Memphis-based AOD Properties, LLC purchased the building in May 2022 for $520,000, according to the Shelby County Register of Deeds. (The building was most recently known as the Prince Hall Masonic Lodge.) AOD Properties is an affiliate of Memphis-based architecture firm UrbanARCH Associates. UrbanARCH co-owner Brian Bullard has overseen the project and in 2022 and 2023 applied for incentives with the Downtown Memphis Commission (DMC). Plans are to renovate the three-story building into a mixed-use space. Memphis Light, Gas and Water (MLGW) crews work outside 154 G.E. Patterson Ave. on Thursday, Dec. 12, 2024. The historic building is being converted into a mixed-use building with office space on the first floor and 10 apartments on the upper two floors. In June 2022, the Center City Development Corp., an affiliate board of the DMC, approved a $60,000 development grant to AOD Properties for redeveloping the site. In July 2023, the Center City Revenue Finance Corp., a DMC-affiliated board, approved a 10-year payment-in-lieu-of-taxes (PILOT) for the $4.6 million project. Plans for the site would convert the 13,083-square-foot building into a mixed-use space. The first floor would be an office space, with plans for UrbanARCH to relocate its offices there. (Currently, the architecture firm is located nearby at 498 S. Main St.) The upper two floors would be converted into 10 apartment units, the residential component is called DeSoto Lofts, according to the PILOT application. The building will have a controlled access parking lot with 13 parking spaces for residents and guests. The DeSoto Lofts name is derived from the building's history \u2014 it was built in 1913 as the DeSoto Hotel, according to the PILOT application. It was converted into a Masonic Lodge in the 1970s. MANE STREET MEMPHIS: 2 notable Downtown projects awarded historic development grants A rendering of DeSoto Lofts at 154 G.E.

UrbanARCH was founded in 2002 and recently oversaw the design of Concourse B at Memphis International Airport . Susannah Herring and Gabe Velasquez of November 6 Investments are also involved in the DeSoto Lofts project.

Dive Brief: Geico and Travelers were fined a combined $11.3 million for poor data security practices that allowed hackers to steal personal data on 120,000 people, New York officials said Monday. New York Attorney General Letitia James and New York State Department of Financial Services Superintendent Adrienne Harris issued penalties against the auto insurance companies for failing to protect customers\u2019 private information. The settlement calls for Geico to pay a total fine of $9.75 million and Travelers will pay $1.55 million. \u201cGeico and Travelers offer drivers protection during times of emergencies, but these companies failed to protect consumers\u2019 personal information,\u201d James said in a statement. \u201cData breaches can lead to serious fraud, and that is why it is important for all companies to take cybersecurity and data protection seriously.\u201d Dive Insight: The penalties stem from a series of cyberattacks targeting Geico\u2019s auto insurance quoting tools in late 2020 and an attack on a similar Travelers tool early 2021. New York officials allege Geico failed to protect prospective customers\u2019 driver\u2019s license numbers on its internal systems. Attackers exploited vulnerabilities in Geico\u2019s insurance agent\u2019s quoting tool and ultimately stole personal information of 116,000 New York residents, the state officials said. Hackers used compromised credentials in April 2021 to access Travelers\u2019 agent portal, which was not protected by multifactor authentication. The breach went undetected for more than seven months, according to state officials, and resulted in the theft of personal information on about 4,000 New York residents. The attackers used some of the stolen driver\u2019s license numbers to file fraudulent unemployment claims during the COVID-19 pandemic, New York state officials said. Geico and Travelers, as part of the settlement, agreed to strengthen their cybersecurity practices by maintaining logs, safeguarding private information with authentication and enhancing threat response procedures. \u201cProtecting the information of all our stakeholders is a top priority, and we will continue to partner with our independent agents to prevent similar incidents in the future,\u201d a Travelers spokesperson said. Travelers\u2019 internal systems were not impacted by this incident, the spokesperson added. Geico said it is also working to prevent future attacks. Story Continues \u201cWhen this issue was identified, Geico self-reported it to New York state officials and the company made improvements to its systems to prevent additional exploitation by these fraudsters,\u201d a Geico spokesperson said. \u201cGeico takes data security very seriously and has since committed significant resources to further strengthen its cybersecurity program.\u201d

order: 2014\u20132024 Christine Romero-Chan Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 12:00 AM 13 min read Like the iPhone did for cell phones, the Apple Watch has changed the market of health and fitness trackers forever. While the iPhone was the biggest product launch under Steve Jobs, the Apple Watch has become Tim Cook\u2019s biggest product launch since taking over after Jobs\u2019 death in 2011. The original Apple Watch was first announced in September 2014, and since that time, we\u2019ve had a decade of Apple Watch models for every budget and person. That decade has seen a lot of changes in the Apple Watch, and while the general shape hasn\u2019t changed, we\u2019ve seen many new features, slimmer bezels, and even a new rugged outlook for certain models. Join us in a walk down memory lane as we visit every Apple Watch release and reminisce about what made each one special and how we got to the current Apple Watch Series 10. Every Apple Watch release in order Apple Watch model Release date Apple Watch Series 0 April 24, 2015 Apple Watch Series 1 September 16, 2016 Apple Watch Series 2 September 16, 2016 Apple Watch Series 3 September 22, 2017 Apple Watch Series 4 September 21, 2018 Apple Watch Series 5 September 20, 2019 Apple Watch Series 6 September 18, 2020 Apple Watch SE September 18, 2020 Apple Watch Series 7 October 15, 2021 Apple Watch Series 8 September 16, 2022 Apple Watch SE 2 September 16, 2022 Apple Watch Ultra September 23, 2022 Apple Watch Series 9 September 22, 2023 Apple Watch Ultra 2 September 22, 2023 Apple Watch Series 10 September 20, 2024 Apple Watch Series 0 (April 2015) Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Like the original iPhone , which was announced on January 9, 2007, but released on June 29, 2007, the first Apple Watch was announced quite a few months before it hit store shelves. The original Apple Watch was announced on September 9, 2014, but didn\u2019t go on sale until April 24, 2015. The Apple Watch was billed as Apple\u2019s \u201cmost personal device ever.\u201d Like Fitbit devices, which were number one at the time, the Apple Watch had a built-in heart rate sensor and an accelerometer, and it used your paired iPhone for location data to help track key metrics during your workout sessions. But the first Apple Watch was so much more than just another health tracker. It was the first wearable to get iPhone notifications, utilize Apple Pay, and crucially, it was the first to really allow users to communicate through their wrist by sending and receiving calls and messages. The small display was perfectly optimized to be a special user interface to give you information at a glance. It also offered unique watch faces and the Digital Crown, which has since become as iconic as the iPod Click Wheel. Story Continues Apple introduced the Apple Watch in three varieties: the Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport, and the infamous Apple Watch Edition, which was made with pure 18-karat gold and started at $10,000 and went up to $17,000. The regular non-Edition models started at $349. Though the original Apple Watch was revolutionary at the time, it also had one problem: speed. The Series 0 was often slow to act, to the point where it would have been faster to simply launch the app on your iPhone. Apple Watch Series 1 and Series 2 (September 2016) Julian Chokkattu / Digital Trends In 2017, Apple released the Apple Watch Series 1, which was a slightly improved version of the original that fixed a few issues with the original. The Series 1 had a new dual-core processor, which improved the overall performance speed by 50%, and the price was reduced to $269. Apple also released the Apple Watch Series 2 alongside the Series 1. The Series 2 was a big deal because it added vital features to the wearable, including GPS and waterproofing. GPS meant the Apple Watch didn\u2019t need an iPhone for location data, and waterproofing meant being able to wear it during water activities like swimming. These remain key features of the Apple Watch to this day. Apple also added the Breathe app to the Apple Watch Series 2, which encouraged users to take a moment to do breathing exercises. This was the first step toward improving mental and physical health with the wearable. The Series 2 was also the first Apple Watch to offer a white ceramic case option, though it was more expensive than stainless steel. Apple Watch Series 3 (September 2017) Julian Chokkattu / Digital Trends The Apple Watch Series 3 was a big leap forward for Apple\u2019s wearable, which was now on an annual update cycle. This was the first Apple Watch to add a standalone cellular connection, though you would have to purchase a separate monthly plan to use it. However, with an independent cellular connection, you could finally take and make calls on the Apple Watch without relying on a paired iPhone. Apple also upgraded the Apple Watch Series 3 with the new and much faster S3 chip, more RAM, and a barometric altimeter for tracking elevation during workouts. The Series 3 also included Siri on the Apple Watch for the first time. Apple Watch Series 4 (September 2018) Julian Chokkattu / Digital Trends The Apple Watch Series 4 was one of the biggest and most important versions of the Apple Watch. For the first three iterations, Apple had been using the 38mm and 42mm sizes, but the Apple Watch Series 4 brought bigger screen sizes, going up to 40mm and 44mm, respectively. Apple also optimized speed and performance, and introduced the W3 chip for Bluetooth connectivity. The Series 4 was the first Apple Watch to include ECG sensors, which allowed the wearer to take an electrocardiogram from their wrist. This functionality provided vital information on their heart rate, as well as warnings about potential health issues. And don\u2019t forget about Fall Detection, which also debuted on the Series 4. This utilizes the Apple Watch\u2019s accelerometers to detect sudden falls or drops that are followed by short periods of motionlessness. If detected, the Apple Watch displays a message on the screen to check if the wearer is OK or if they require medical assistance. If the message is not dismissed or there is still no movement after a minute, emergency services and emergency contacts will be contacted and the wearer\u2019s GPS location will be provided. While Fall Detection may have been initially targeted to an elderly and infirm demographic, it has actually helped many users of all ages, and even saved their lives. Apple Watch Series 5 (September 2019) Julian Chokkattu / Digital Trends Like it\u2019s predecessor, the Apple Watch Series 5 was also a very big deal, as it paved the road for future mainline Apple Watches. The big feature debuting with the Series 5 was the always-on display (AOD) that was requested by many users. For this, Apple needed to use LTPO displays, which are low-temperature polysilicone and oxide panels that make it possible for the screen to refresh slowly when not in use (1Hz) and then return to a normal 60Hz rate when active. The Series 5 was also the last Apple Watch to offer the white ceramic case option, but the first to introduce titanium cases. These came in natural and Space Black finishes. The Series 5 was also the first to add a compass app for better navigation, emergency calling, more storage (32GB), and a better ambient light sensor. Apple Watch Series 6 (September 2020) Apple Watch Artist face Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Apple continued its trend toward making a viable health wearable with the Apple Watch Series 6 . Though it didn\u2019t look much different from its predecessor, it did finally add SpO2 monitoring, allowing users to measure their blood oxygen levels. This was beneficial because it could help spot any potential health issues or illnesses before it was too late. The Apple Watch Series 6 also added basic sleep tracking and a brighter display, and had slightly faster performance than its predecessor. Apple even added two new colors to the lineup: red and blue. Apple Watch SE (September 2020) Andy Boxall / Digital Trends The Apple Watch SE launched alongside the Series 6. However, it didn\u2019t offer the same features as the mainline Apple Watch \u2014 in fact, it offered less. So what made the Apple Watch SE special? It was the Apple Watch to get if you were on a tight budget, as it was much more affordable. The SE started at just $280, instead of $400 like the regular Apple Watch. But of course, it sacrificed features for affordability. It didn\u2019t have an always-on display, ECG, and blood oxygen monitoring. But it was still a very good basic smartwatch. Apple Watch Series 7 (October 2021) Andy Boxall / Digital Trends While there were plenty of rumors that the Apple Watch Series 7 would have a brand new design, they did not come to fruition. Instead, the Apple Watch Series 7 retained the same overall design as previous models. However, Apple did increase the display size yet again, so it now measured 41mm and 45mm. The new curved display appeared to \u201cwrap around\u201d the sides, which meant it could retain the same dimensions as the previous model, while also having a larger display. The new Series 7 also included 33% faster charging so that one could have enough power to wear the Apple Watch to bed for sleep tracking, though this did require a brand new puck charger. The Series 7 was also the first time Apple added an onscreen keyboard for typing, right on the Apple Watch. Apple Watch Series 8 (September 2022) Joe Maring / Digital Trends While the Apple Watch Series 8 could be considered a smaller update in the Apple Watch lineup, it did have some nice additions. It was the first Apple Watch to introduce body temperature monitoring, which helps with ovulation tracking and was especially useful for women who are planning a family. Apple also improved the sleep-tracking functionality to provide more in-depth details, such as sleep stages and other vital information. Apple also added car crash detection to the Apple Watch Series 8, which was first introduced with the iPhone 14 line. This feature will detect if you are in a car crash using the sensors in the watch. It will ask if you are OK and then inquire if you need to call emergency services. It\u2019s a feature that is great to have, but one you don\u2019t want to use. Apple Watch SE 2 (September 2022) Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Apple\u2019s budget-friendly smartwatch made a return with a new-and-improved version. Again, the Apple Watch SE is an affordable option for those who want an Apple Watch, but don\u2019t need all the fancy features. The Apple Watch SE 2 brought an upgraded S8 processor for faster performance and functionality, Fall Detection, and Car Crash Detection, both of which offer extra peace of mind in case the worst happens. Apple Watch Ultra (September 2022) Andy Boxall / Digital Trends The Apple Watch Ultra was Apple\u2019s first rugged smartwatch, designed for those who love outdoor and \u201cextreme\u201d activities. This was also the biggest design change in the history of the Apple Watch. The Apple Watch Ultra introduced a thicker, bulkier 49mm body, a titanium frame, and a flat display with sapphire glass. The Digital Crown and side button are also more prominently raised on the side. Apple also introduced the Action button with this model. Significant features of the Apple Watch Ultra included being waterproof up to 100 meters and the addition of an integrated dive computer that can monitor water pressure and temperature. The battery life hit around 36 hours on a single charge, and the brightness could get up to 2,000 nits. There\u2019s also an 86-decibel siren for emergencies, which is useful in remote locations. Apple Watch Series 9 (September 2023) Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Though the Apple Watch Series 9 looks a lot like its predecessor, it did bring some big improvements on the inside. The Apple Watch Series 9\u2019s new S9 chip has enough power for the then-new Double Tap gesture. This is a one-handed gesture that lets users answer calls, turn off alarms, or even make selections in menus just by tapping their index finger and thumb together twice. Thanks to the sensors in the Series 9, it can detect when there is a change in blood flow and muscle tension, thus allowing for the Double Tap gesture. The S9 chip also brought some big improvements to Siri. Thanks to the new processor, all Siri requests are localized and don\u2019t require a data connection, so it\u2019s much faster. Siri can even access your Health information. The Apple Watch Series 9 could also reach 2,000 nits of peak brightness, which is the same as the original Apple Watch Ultra. Apple Watch Ultra 2 (September 2023) Apple Like the Series 9, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 wasn\u2019t a big upgrade. But that wasn\u2019t really needed, not when the original Ultra was so good. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 also got the S9 chip, allowing for Double Tap, on-device localized Siri requests, and Siri access to Health information. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 got an improved display with brightness peaking at 3,000 nits. In September 2024, Apple released the Apple Watch Ultra 2 in a brand new Black Titanium color. Other than the color, there were no other new features. Apple Watch Series 10 (September 2024) Joe Maring / Digital Trends And here we are, the latest and greatest Apple Watch: the Apple Watch Series 10 . That\u2019s a decade of Apple Watches. Though the Series 10 did not have a huge redesign like many were thinking it might, it is a big leap forward. While the Series 10 looks very similar to its predecessors, Apple did make some very nice improvements to the body and display. The Series 10 is about 10% thinner and lighter. Though it may not sound like a big deal, you can actually feel the difference when wearing it. There\u2019s also a new Jet Black aluminum, which has a polished finish, and it\u2019s made with all metal. The display of the Series 10 also got major upgrades. It now uses a wide-angle OLED display, so the edges of the display kind of wrap around the sides of the body. It\u2019s also 40% brighter when looking at the watch from an angle. It\u2019s bigger as well, with the small size now being 42mm, while the large one is 46mm. It\u2019s actually equivalent to the Apple Watch Ultra display size. Though the battery life still is just about a full day, the charging speeds have been improved. You can now get about 80% battery in 30 minutes.
