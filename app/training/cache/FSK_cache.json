In the world of investing, reaching high returns is a goal for both new and seasoned investors. The journey toward this outcome often involves a portfolio with a mix of dividend-paying stocks and growth-focused stocks. While dividend-focused stocks provide steady cash flow, growth-focused stocks aspire toward substantial capital appreciation. The former mostly appeals to those seeking a reliable source of income, while the latter attracts investors who prioritize long-term wealth accumulation.

For one Reddit poster, deciding how to start with a $10K rollover IRA has sparked a lively debate. The investor, eager to dive into the dividends paradise, hopes to build a good foundation for financial abundance. Still, because of his limited experience with investing, he\u2019s turned to Reddit for advice. His main question, \u201cIf you had $10k to invest, how would you personally make the most of it?\u201d has triggered various suggestions and bold recommendations. The poster\u2019s goal is to achieve a reliable income through dividends, but he\u2019s also open to advice on maximizing his returns.

I\u2019d be investing in index funds, trying to grow my pile of cash,\u201d a Redditor says. \u201cBuy index funds and hold them,\u201d another comment reads. Story Continues One Reddit member of the r/dividends community suggested the S&P 500 fund, saying that the $10K would generate cash in the long run. \u201cS&P 500 stock. I would not worry about dividends if I started over! If you were 20 years old and put in $10,000, that would be worth a crapload of money!\u201d the Redditor says. Focus on Time in the Market, not Timing the Market A recurring piece of advice in the comments was that staying invested over the long term is more crucial than trying to predict the market\u2019s highs and lows and invest based on these fluctuations. \u201cTime in the market, not timing the market. It\u2019s an expensive lesson I learned,\u201d an investor wrote in the thread. One comment highlighted that investing in stocks is a long-term game and should be considered so to be successful. \u201cHistorical return over the full life is all we can focus on. Meaning the longer you're in the market, the better chance of success. It's not a 15-year game. I say it's a 30-year play,\u201d the comment says.

Instead of taxable accounts, investors in the r/dividends community recommended tax-efficient funds and/or growth stocks. \u201cIn a taxable account, theoretically growth stocks have the advantage of not recognizing annual taxable income as much as you have with dividends,\u201d a comment says.

A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years. Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements. Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for FS KKR Capital basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price. Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock. Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for FS KKR Capital imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher. Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Story Continues Earnings Estimate Revisions for FS KKR Capital This business development company is expected to earn $2.89 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2024, which represents a year-over-year change of -7.1%. Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for FS KKR Capital. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1.1%. Bottom Line Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.

(FSK) a Great Value Stock Right Now? Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 1, 2025, 5:40 PM 2 min read In This Article: FSK -0.77% The proven Zacks Rank system focuses on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find winning stocks. Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks. Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks. Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's \"Value\" category. Stocks with both \"A\" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now. One company to watch right now is FS KKR Capital Corp. (FSK) . FSK is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 8.34 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 8.52. Over the last 12 months, FSK's Forward P/E has been as high as 8.49 and as low as 6.19, with a median of 7.29. Another valuation metric that we should highlight is FSK's P/B ratio of 0.91. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 0.99. FSK's P/B has been as high as 0.93 and as low as 0.75, with a median of 0.83, over the past year. Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. FSK has a P/S ratio of 3.45. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 3.54. These are just a handful of the figures considered in FS KKR Capital Corp.'s great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that FSK is an impressive value stock right now. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' Portfolio This Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock? Indeed, an investment in a BDC is not suitable for every investor. Inherently, these are a portfolio of predominantly debt instruments packed into public equities. However, yield-seeking investors tend to be interested in these instruments due to the high dividend yields and dividend growth they offer. BDCs pay a high dividend because they are obligated to pay out 90% of their taxable income as a dividend to avoid corporate tax, just like a REIT. Therefore, the leveraged free cash flow and distributions are higher with a tax benefit. For someone close to retirement or retired, BDCs are great because they offer a generous dividend, and the stock price volatility tends to be lower compared to equity blue-chips, for example. Based on a stock price of $21.75 and adding the last four dividends of 48 cents paid in 2024, ARCC's dividend yield is 8.82%. The regular dividend has been relatively stable throughout the years and was only cut in 2019 during the financial crisis. At the same time, Ares Capital has occasionally distributed special dividends , as was the case in 2022 and 2019. Overall, the attractiveness of ARCC's dividend lies not solely in its yieldsince FSK and BXSL offer higher yieldsbut in its superior five-year CAGR of 4% . Portfolio of BDC Ares Capital: A Well Diversified Portfolio And An 8% Dividend Yield Source: ARCC Investor Relations In essence, ARCC's asset allocation consists of first-lien secured loans, which account for more than half of the portfolio. After that, they hold more risky asset types, such as subordinated loans and equities. Nonetheless, the issuer concentration is pretty insignificant, with an average position size of 0.2% and moderate portfolio leverage. Simultaneously, the diversification among industries is robust and consists predominantly of non-cyclical industries with attractive growth prospects and high free cash flows. Ares Capital: A Well Diversified Portfolio And An 8% Dividend Yield Source: YCharts From a volatility perspective, net asset value per share proxied by book value per share is a proper metric for analyzing the ups and downs of the financials of a business development company. Overall, pre-covid, the book value of Ares Capital was stable. Of course, it was affected during Covid and mid-2022 due to high inflation, which caused credit instruments to drop, but generally, the book value per share has been on a solid rising trend. Story Continues Ares Capital: A Well Diversified Portfolio And An 8% Dividend Yield Source: ARCC Investor Relations Ares Capital's investments are mainly financed with borrowed funds in revolving credits, securitizations, and unsecured loans. Here, ARCC has a competitive edge over other BDCs as it has the highest credit ratings among the three leading raters. Simultaneously, S&P Global increased its long-term debt to BBB from BBB- in Q3. On the other hand, Fitch maintained the BBB rating, and Moody's maintained the Baa2 rating. Outlook and Risks For the most part, ARCC's debt portfolio is floating, meaning that the quarterly interest received combines the previous period's SOFR rate and a fixed credit spread. The SOFR rate is highly correlated with the federal funds rate, and technically, the time in which the company would receive the most interest is when rates are high. With the ongoing rate cut environment (although the FED has hinted at lower rate cut expectations), Ares is exposed to receiving a lower income from its investments and simultaneously re-investing them at less attractive rates. Nonetheless, the dividend's safety is more than covered by the $5.407 billion excess borrowing capacity from revolving credit and a spillover income that was 2x higher than the quarterly dividend in Q3. \"Should market interest rates decline, we believe the value of our attractive dividend yield that is well covered by core earnings and supported by a strong level of spillover income will become even more valued by equity investors.\" Kipp DeVeer CEO Valuation Ares Capital: A Well Diversified Portfolio And An 8% Dividend Yield ARCC Data by GuruFocus Unlike most American banks, business development companies report their investments at fair value. Therefore, book value per share is a reasonable indicator of the company's fair value or net asset value. With a price-to-book of 1.1x, the stock price seems slightly above compared to the average level of 1.03x. Despite this, it is a low-volatility stock as most of the core assets are first-lien debt, and waiting for the stock price to drop is a missed opportunity for accruing the dividend payments. Conclusion Ares Capital has had a tremendous total return of approximately 254% over the last decade. The company owns a well-diversified portfolio with predominantly middle-market companies that generate higher yields and dividend payments than traditional public investments. These investment characteristics are attractive for an investor close to retirement looking for a high dividend payment. Simultaneously, the company has a strong capital position and credit ratings on their debt. Although the interest rate cuts are a headwind to the portfolio, the yields received would most likely still be higher than the historical average of the past 15 years. Finally, the valuation at 1.1x book value is still decent for an investor not to be concerned about overvaluation. This article first appeared on GuruFocus .

Yield Financial ETF (KBWD) a Strong ETF Right Now? Zacks Equity Research Mon, Dec 30, 2024, 2:20 PM 4 min read In This Article: VFH -0.60% A smart beta exchange traded fund, the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD) debuted on 12/02/2010, and offers broad exposure to the Financials ETFs category of the market. What Are Smart Beta ETFs? The ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on market capitalization weighted indexes that are designed to represent the market or a particular segment of the market. Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way. If you're the kind of investor who would rather try and beat the market through good stock selection, then smart beta funds are your best choice; this fund class is known for tracking non-cap weighted strategies. By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such. Even though this space provides many choices to investors--think one of the simplest methodologies like equal-weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting--not all have been able to deliver first-rate results. Fund Sponsor & Index The fund is managed by Invesco. KBWD has been able to amass assets over $396.13 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Financials ETFs. Before fees and expenses, KBWD seeks to match the performance of the KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index. The KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index is a dividend yield weighted index seeking to reflect the performance of approximately 24 to 40 publicly listed financial companies engaged in the business of providing financial services and products, including banking, insurance and diversified financial services, in the US. Cost & Other Expenses Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same. Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 2.02%, making it one of the most expensive products in the space. It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 12.49%. Sector Exposure and Top Holdings Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis. Representing 100% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector. Story Continues Looking at individual holdings, Blackrock Tcp Capital Corp (TCPC) accounts for about 3.93% of total assets, followed by Trinity Capital Inc (TRIN) and Fs Kkr Capital Corp (FSK). KBWD's top 10 holdings account for about 35.54% of its total assets under management. Performance and Risk The ETF has added about 3.70% so far this year and is up roughly 2.02% in the last one year (as of 12/30/2024). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $14.54 and $16.26. The fund has a beta of 1.42 and standard deviation of 20.93% for the trailing three-year period, which makes KBWD a medium risk choice in this particular space. With about 41 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers. Alternatives Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF is not a suitable option for investors seeking to outperform the Financials ETFs segment of the market. Instead, there are other ETFs in the space which investors should consider. Vanguard Financials ETF (VFH) tracks MSCI US Investable Market Financials 25/50 Index and the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF) tracks Financial Select Sector Index. Vanguard Financials ETF has $11.33 billion in assets, Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF has $48.75 billion. VFH has an expense ratio of 0.10% and XLF charges 0.09%. Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Financials ETFs.
