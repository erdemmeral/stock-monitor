[{"text": "If EPS Growth Is Important To You, NewMarket (NYSE:NEU) Presents An Opportunity editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 3:40 PM 4 min read In This Article: NEU -2.68% The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should. Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like NewMarket ( NYSE:NEU ). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. View our latest analysis for NewMarket How Fast Is NewMarket Growing? Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Shareholders will be happy to know that NewMarket's EPS has grown 27% each year, compound, over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming. One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. This approach makes NewMarket look pretty good, on balance; although revenue is flattish, EBIT margins improved from 19% to 22% in the last year. Which is a great look for the company. The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers. NYSE:NEU Earnings and Revenue History January 23rd 2025 While profitability drives the upside, prudent investors always check the balance sheet, too . Are NewMarket Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders? It should give investors a sense of security owning shares in a company if insiders also own shares, creating a close alignment their interests. NewMarket followers will find comfort in knowing that insiders have a significant amount of capital that aligns their best interests with the wider shareholder group. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$801m. That equates to 17% of the company, making insiders powerful and aligned with other shareholders. So there is opportunity here to invest in a company whose management have tangible incentives to deliver. Story Continues It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. For companies with market capitalisations between US$2.0b and US$6.4b, like NewMarket, the median CEO pay is around US$6.6m. The NewMarket CEO received total compensation of just US$3.2m in the year to December 2023. That looks like a modest pay packet, and may hint at a certain respect for the interests of shareholders. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making. Does NewMarket Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist? If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into NewMarket's strong EPS growth. If you need more convincing beyond that EPS growth rate, don't forget about the reasonable remuneration and the high insider ownership. Everyone has their own preferences when it comes to investing but it definitely makes NewMarket look rather interesting indeed. Don't forget that there may still be risks.

(\"First Mining\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: FF) (OTCQX: FFMGF) (FRANKFURT: FMG) is pleased to announce new drilling results\u00a0from the 2024 Phase 3 diamond drilling program at its Duparquet Gold Project (\" Duparquet Project \" or the \" Project \") located in Quebec, Canada . First Mining has identified two new discovery gold zones during the expansion drilling at the Valentre target. Assay results for the newly discovered \"Miroir Zone\", located north of the Valentre target, returned 3.12 g/t Au over 19.35 m , including 5.47 g/t Au over 9.6 m . Further drill results from the program identified a second discovery, the \"Aiguille Zone\", occurring south of the Valentre target, returning 8.99 g/t Au over 3.1 m . In total, 142* unique mineralized intercepts in 16 drill holes have been encountered in the Valentre expansion area, including the new discoveries at Miroir and Aiguille. These new drill results support a strong continuity in mineralization within the Central Duparquet , Valentre and Dumico (\" CVD \") area, while highlighting an affinity for additional discovery zones with increasing exploration at the Duparquet Project. \"The discovery of these two new gold zones at our Duparquet Gold Project demonstrates the continued success of our exploration program at the Project,\" stated Dan Wilton , CEO of First Mining. \"With more than two full exploration seasons now under our belt at Duparquet , our team is producing exceptional drill results with a degree of predictability supported by a robust geoscience foundation. \u00a0On top of the existing mineral resource base of 3.44 Moz of Measured & Indicated resource and 2.64 Moz of Inferred resource, these results demonstrate that Duparquet is well positioned to achieve significant resource growth, demonstrating that Duparquet is one of the strongest gold-endowed assets in Canada , strategically located in the heart of the Abitibi gold belt in Quebec .\" A map highlighting the target locations in the CVD area, including Miroir and Aiguille, as well as locations of recent drill holes is presented in Figure 1, and corresponding assay highlights are presented in Table 1, with full assay results listed in Table 2 and drill hole locations in Table 3.

Further drilling will also provide advancement at the highly prospective Buzz target and North Zone with a focus on growth as well as the top regional targets delineated in 2024, further supporting opportunity for new discoveries. Figure 2: Representative long section through the Central Duparquet, Valentre, and Dumico targets, highlighting the multiple significant intercepts returned in 2023 and in the 2024 Phase 3 program, as well as upcoming drill hole targets aimed at unlocking exploration opportunities. (CNW Group/First Mining Gold Corp.) \"For 2025, our team is planning for increased drilling programs that will capitalize on our momentum through a continued opening of the exploration space at Duparquet ,\" stated James Maxwell , VP Exploration and Project Operations of First Mining. \"We anticipate expanded outcomes with each additional drill metre by leveraging our foundational geoscience platforms to establish the Duparquet Project as a top-tier gold endowment in the Abitibi Greenstone Belt.\" Central Duparquet , Valentre and Dumico (\"CVD\") The 2024 drilling program at the CVD area totalled 16 holes and 4,644 m . The CVD drilling campaign was aimed at testing approximately 200 m of strike length at the targeted area, which has demonstrated significant potential for resource expansion through on-strike extension drilling and north and south step-outs within the CVD area (Figure 2). Expanding the exploration search space is a core aspect of the growth strategy for the Project, including the evaluation of areas that have never been drill tested. Recent results in the CVD area have demonstrated a high degree of mineralization continuity, along with two new gold discoveries (Miroir and Aiguille), located to the north and south of the Valentre target. These results have expanded the CVD target area, which now boasts a gold mineralization footprint extending 1,700 m east-west in a corridor approximately 500 m wide. The depth potential remains largely underexplored, presenting significant opportunities for further evaluation. Additional Details on CVD, Aiguille, and Miroir Drilling CVD The Valentre portion of the CVD drilling strategy has been focused on targeting the mineralization continuity of multiple gold zones that occur within an underexplored area east of the main Duparquet resource centre where the opportunity for significant strike extension has been identified. The Valentre target area spans approximately 200 m along strike between two established centres of mineral resource wireframes ( Central Duparquet and Dumico), where drilling aims to support continuity and ultimately provide a new centre for resource growth. First Mining completed an initial drill test to derisk this opportunity during their Phase 1 drill program conducted in 2023 ( see press release date September 5, 2023 ) that returned a total of six discrete gold intercepts central to the area, which prompted additional drilling. Recent results from the 2024 drilling programs have returned further supporting intercepts which include 3.27 g/t Au over 10.2 m from 215.2 m to 225.4 m in drill hole DUP24-036, 2.11 g/t Au over 10.15 m from 72.75 m to 82.9 m in drill hole DUP24-037, and 2.16 g/t Au over 17.48 m including 3.96 g/t Au over 4 m from 314.56 m to 318.52 m , and including 11.80 g/t Au over 0.53 m from 325.79 m to 326.32 m in drill hole DUP24-043 (Figure 3). \u00a0The drill data collected to date is now being integrated into updated geoscience models, aimed at developing new and refined wireframes within the trend. These updates will support potential resource additions while targeting higher-grade zones for exploration at depth where the target remains open. The Central Duparquet and Dumico portion of the CVD drilling strategy was focused on potential resource expansion at depth and increasing the geoscience confidence of the controls on mineralization along strike between the Central Duparquet , Valentre, and Dumico areas. In 2024, the Central Duparquet drill program comprised three holes - DUP24-027 ( see press release date August 28, 2024 ), DUP24-041, and DUP24-044, with \u00a0DUP24-041 returning 3.54 g/t Au over 15.1 m from 169.9 m to 185.0 m . This program was successful in testing the secondary plunge to the higher-grade zones in the Central Duparquet area. The higher-grade zones are theorized to plunge steeply to the west or near-vertical along the main mineralization trend, and in this area they remain open at depth. The 2024 Dumico drill program comprised one drillhole (DUP24-047) which returned 1.56 g/t Au over 10.80 m from 235.2 m to 246.0 m , including 1 m at 6.84 g/t Au from 238.0 m to 239 m . This program was successful in further expanding and confirming the resource potential at depth in the Dumico area. Gold mineralization at the CVD area is hosted within mineralized silica- and sericite-altered syenite units with very fine-grained disseminated pyrite ranging from 0.5 - 3%. Gold mineralization is also coincident with dark smokey quartz veins and veinlets, with up to 3% fine-grained disseminated pyrite mineralization. The gold-mineralized quartz veins are hosted within syenite units, and intervals of alternating syenite and mafic and ultramafic volcanic units. Figure 3: Valentre Target \u2013 DUP24-026, DUP24-034, DUP24-035, DUP24-036, DUP24-037, DUP24-038, DUP24-043 are holes targeting the potential mineralization continuity between Central Duparquet and Dumico. Significant intercepts are highlighted downhole, with higher-grade zones identified along altered mineralized syenite units. These drill holes are also a test of mineralization continuity up and down-dip of previously drilled hole DUP23-006.The cross section is looking west. (CNW Group/First Mining Gold Corp.) Miroir The new gold discovery, Miroir, was identified during the recent Valentre expansion drilling. Drill hole DUP24-048 was collared 250 metres to the north of Valentre in an effort to step back and drill under areas of previous drilling success at Valentre ( see press release dated August 28, 2024 ), and to intersect the underexplored northern contact of the mafic volcanic-syenite contact area which has demonstrated a stronger affinity for higher-grade mineralization in the North Zone target area of the Project. The Miroir zone is located 225 m to the north of the Valentre target and is initially intercepted at bedrock level, making it an extremely encouraging shallow exploration opportunity for further advancement (Figure 5). Assays from drill hole DUP24-048 in the Miroir zone returned 3.12 g/t Au over 19.35 m from 6.75 m to 26.10 m , including 5.47 g/t Au over 9.60 m from 15.5 m to 25.1 m (Figure 4). Miroir mineralization is hosted within a silica-altered basalt unit with up to 5% very fine-grained fracture-controlled pyrite mineralization and fine-grained disseminated pyrite mineralization that occurs immediately adjacent to the contact with the CVD syenite. Rheologic contrast between the geochemically favourable volcanic host rock units and the syenite are interpreted as favourable settings for gold mineralization and are being prioritized as high-value exploration drilling targets at the Duparquet Project.\u00a0 Strong grade and width accompanied by these factors are similar to that seen at the North Zone target and are thought to \"mirror\" recent success in drilling at the North Zone where results included 5.97 g/t Au over 33.0 m in hole DUP24-024 ( see press release dated June 18, 2024 ) and which is located approximately 1,500 m to the northwest of the Miroir Discovery. Figure 4: Valentre, Dumico Target and Miroir \u2013 Holes DUP24-039, DUP24-040, DUP24-047 and DUP24-048 are holes designed to target the potential mineralization continuity between Valentre and Dumico as well as at depth. Significant intercepts are highlighted downhole, with higher-grade zones identified along altered mineralized syenite units. These drill holes are also a test of mineralization continuity up and down-dip of previously reported DUP24-025. The cross section is looking west. (CNW Group/First Mining Gold Corp.) Figure 5: Representative long section through Miroir target, highlighting the significant intercepts returned in 2023 and 2024, and the 2025 upcoming drill hole targets aimed at defining and unlocking the exploration opportunity. (CNW Group/First Mining Gold Corp.) Aiguille The second new gold discovery, Aiguille, was also identified during the 2024 follow-up drilling at Valentre. \u00a0Drill hole DUP24-041 was extended beyond the target depth by site geologists, owing to a change in the expected geology surrounding Valentre identified during the drilling. Lithologies intersected were syenite units with favourable sericite alteration and fine-grained disseminated pyrite sulphide mineralization, which were fairly continuous in an area where volcanic lithologies are typically intruded by lesser syenite units and bounded by gabbro. \u00a0A geoscience-driven extension of this drill hole resulted in the discovery of the Aiguille zone, with hole DUP24-041 returning 1.87 g/t Au over 11.05 m from 353.1 m to 364.15 m , including 8.35 g/t Au over 0.7 m from 359.1 m to 359.8 m . \u00a0An adjustment in the next CVD hole delivered even more favourable results, with hole DUP24-044 returning 8.99 g/t Au over 3.10 m from 545.9 m to 549.0 m , including 15.5 g/t Au over 1.0 m from 548 m to 549 m (Figure 6). The discovery zone is located 150 m south of the main Valentre area and remains significantly underexplored, promoting positive opportunities for further drilling at Aiguille with a focus on delineating additional zones and an area for further expansion, at relatively higher grades for the Project. Aiguille mineralization is hosted within silica- and sericite-altered syenite units and graphitic argillite, with fine-grained disseminated pyrite mineralization up to 5% and dark smokey quartz veining. Increased volume and scale in combination with the mineralization styles including sulphides and veins is interpreted as being attributable to the returned higher Au grades, in comparison to the conventional CVD mineralization overall. First Mining will follow up with additional drilling at this target area in 2025, with an opportunity to expand and extend the mineralization up-dip and along strike. Figure 6: Central Duparquet Target and Aiguille \u2013 drill holes DUP24-041 and DUP24-044 are targeting the potential mineralization continuity between Central Duparquet and Valentre, and testing the mineralization along the southern contact of the syenite (Aiguille).

The Project benefits from easy access and proximity to an existing workforce and infrastructure, including road, rail and hydroelectric grid power. The Duparquet Project currently hosts an NI 43-101 compliant gold resource of 3.44 million ounces in the Measured & Indicated category, grading 1.55 g/t Au, and an additional 2.64 million ounces in the Inferred category, grading 1.62 g/t Au. First Mining completed a Preliminary Economic Assessment 1 (\"PEA\") on the Project in 2023 (see news releases dated September 7, 2023 and October 23, 2023 ). The Duparquet Project totals approximately 5,800 hectares focused on an area of 19 km of strike length along the prolific Destor-Porcupine Fault Zone, along with numerous mineralized splays and influential secondary lineaments. The Duparquet Project includes the past-producing Beattie, Donchester and Duquesne mines as well as the Central Duparquet , Dumico and Pitt Gold deposits. 1 Further details on the Duparquet PEA can be found in the technical report entitled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report: Preliminary Economic Assessment, Duparquet Gold Project, Quebec, Canada\" dated October 20, 2023, which was prepared for First Mining by G Mining Services Inc. in accordance with NI 43-101 and is available under First Mining's SEDAR profile at www.sedarplus.ca Analytical Laboratory and QA/QC Procedures All sampling completed by First Mining within its exploration programs is subject to a Company standard of internal quality control and quality assurance (QA/QC) programs which include the insertion of certified reference materials, blank materials and a level of duplicate analysis. Core samples from the 2024 drilling program at Duparquet were sent to AGAT Laboratories, with sample preparation in Val d'Or and analysis in Thunder Bay , where they were processed for gold analysis by 50 gram fire assay with an atomic absorption finish. Samples from selected holes were sent to AGAT Laboratories in Calgary, Alberta , for multi-element analysis (including silver) by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) method with a four acid digest. AGAT Laboratories systems conform to requirements of ISO/IEC Standard 17025 guidelines and meets assay requirements outlined for NI 43-101.
