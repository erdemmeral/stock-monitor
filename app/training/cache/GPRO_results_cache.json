Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 5 Quality Compounder Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Stocks to Gain From Strengthening Industry Trends Vaishali Doshi Thu, Jan 16, 2025, 4:31 PM 9 min read In This Article: DLB +0.49% GPRO -8.65% ^GSPC -0.76% The Zacks Audio Video Production industry participants are concentrating on the premium segment of the branded products market for business growth. Sony Group Corporation SONY, Dolby Laboratories DLB and GoPro GPRO are likely to benefit from investments in cutting-edge technology solutions that create better communication experiences. The players also stand to gain as they increase focus on direct-to-customer sales channels. Rapid technological advances like 4K, 8K, and immersive audio formats are boosting demand for new devices, which bodes well for participants like GoPro and Dolby. Moreover, with streaming platforms becoming a way of life, these are driving the need for better home sound systems. This is likely to benefit participants like Dolby. However, muted consumer discretionary spending amid weak global macroeconomic conditions is a concern. A highly promotional environment and stiff competition from importers of comparatively low-priced devices are denting margins. Online accessibility of recording equipment and the availability of distribution channels on the Internet are additional headwinds. Industry Description The Zacks Audio Video Production industry comprises television, speaker, video player and camcorder manufacturers. It includes companies that offer gaming consoles, drones, and high-end cameras for individuals and industrial markets. These firms provide state-of-the-art audio, imaging, and voice technologies that enhance entertainment and communication experiences. Some industry participants develop audio and imaging products, including digital cinema servers and products for film production and entertainment industries. Apart from providing theatrical and television production services for cinema exhibitions, broadcast and home entertainment, these companies work with film studios, content creators, broadcasters and video game designers. Some prominent players are present in the music and image-based software markets worldwide. 4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Audio-Video Production Industry Technological Advancement to Spur Growth : Over the years, the shift to digital technology catered to the demand for high-resolution video and reduced the problems of radio frequency and electromagnetic interference, making audio-visual systems more data-network friendly. Wireless transmission has enabled the seamless broadcast of audio and video signals through wireless data networks while enhancing productivity. Industry players have been offering services to diverse media producers. That said, easy online accessibility of recording equipment and the widespread availability of distribution channels on the Internet are hurdles. Increasing Demand for Premium Entertainment : The industry performed well despite drastic changes in how media is consumed and distributed. The rise in demand for premium entertainment from record labels, TV producers and advertisers is likely to stoke profitable growth. Strong demand across all regions with a more direct-to-consumer, subscription-centric model bodes well for the industry participants. Macroeconomic Headwinds Likely to Hurt Consumer Demand : The global macroeconomic weakness and inflationary pressure are likely to keep consumer spending, especially discretionary purchases, in check. While the companies keep investing for market share gains and supply chain resilience, a shortage of critical hardware components due to volatile supply chain dynamics is expected to hurt revenues in the near term. Fluctuations in commodity pricing for different components are additional concerns. Elevated promotional activity to boost sales amid weak spending is also affecting the performance of these industry participants. Aggressive Competition : In the United States, smart-connected televisions, microphones, and speaker enclosures are the most popular electronic devices among customers. However, U.S.-based manufacturers of audio and video systems face intense competition from importers of comparatively low-priced devices, particularly from China, Vietnam and Mexico. These firms face stiff competition across all end markets, often leading to intense price wars and margin contraction.

Price-to-Sales TTM Ratio (Past Five Years) 3 Audio Video Production Stocks Keep an Eye on Dolby : San Francisco-based Dolby Laboratories specializes in audio noise reduction and audio encoding/compression technologies to transform entertainment and communications at theaters, home, work and mobile devices. Continued momentum in Dolby Atmos, imaging patents and Dolby Vision is driving Dolby\u2019s performance. Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos technologies are witnessing rapid adoption in automotive, TV and mobile verticals. The company continues to focus on strategic acquisitions. In June 2024, it announced the buyout of GE Licensing from GE Aerospace for $429 million in an all-cash transaction. GE Licensing, a leading innovator in patent licensing and management, is a subsidiary of GE Aerospace. With this acquisition, Dolby expects to bolster its intellectual property portfolio through the strategic integration between its existing licensing businesses and GE Licensing's portfolio of video codec technologies (HEVC and VVC). Dolby settled the acquisition of GE Licensing in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, strengthening its imaging patent portfolio. Management anticipates the GE Licensing acquisition to add roughly $55 million to total revenues and boost non-GAAP operating margins and earnings in fiscal 2025. Apart from this, the acquisition of THEO Technologies in July 2024, worth $55 million, is aiding its Dolby.io offerings. With THEO, the company plans to address the growing demand for designing customized experiences in sports and entertainment. For fiscal 2025, the company projects Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision to achieve approximately 15% organic growth, while imaging patents are expected to grow around 15%, as tougher comparisons in the imaging patents segment partly offset the revenues from the GE Licensing acquisition. Declining box office performance and weak global consumer electronics sales continue to weigh on Dolby\u2019s performance. Core audio revenues are expected to remain flat, aligning closely with market trends for device shipments. At present, Dolby sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Price and Consensus: DLB GoPro : Headquartered in San Mateo, CA, GoPro is one of the leading manufacturers of the world's most handy cameras, as well as mountable and wearable accessories. GoPro is committed to driving growth through a strategic overhaul. This includes expanding its retail presence, introducing more affordable entry-level cameras and implementing strict cost management measures. Though the company expects 2024 operating expenses to be approximately $360 million (+/- $2 million), it is forecasting a $110 million (at the midpoint of the guidance) reduction in expenses in 2025. Operating expenses in 2025 are expected to be $250 million (+/- $5 million), stemming from a 26% reduction in headcount and other expenses undertaken in 2024. It recorded 2.56 million subscribers (including 54,000 Premium+ subscribers), marking 2% year-over-year growth at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Management envisions subscribers at 2024-end to be up 2% to 2.55 million. To boost its subscriber base, it enhanced its subscription service through benefits and user awareness and aims to work more closely with its retail partners, both in North America and abroad. Delays in the launch of new products, muted consumer spending in the absence of promotional activity and declining camera sales at GoPro.com remain concerns. At present, GPRO carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2025 bottom line is pegged at earnings of 5 cents per share, unchanged in the past seven days. Price and Consensus: GPRO Sony Group Corporation : Headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, Sony Group Corporation designs, manufactures, and sells several consumer and industrial electronic equipment. The company\u2019s product roster comprises audio and video equipment, televisions, network services, game hardware and software, mobile phones, and image sensors. Sony is also active in producing, acquiring, and distributing recorded music and managing and licensing lyrics and music for songs. Sony is well-poised to gain from healthy demand across Games & Network Services (G&NS) and Music and Imaging & Sensing Solutions units amid softness in the financial services unit. The G&NS unit is benefiting from favorable forex impact, higher sales from network services (PlayStation Plus) and rising sales of non-first-party titles. Momentum in recorded music and music publishing sales is aiding the Music unit. Steady growth in operating income bodes well. It has raised its revenue outlook for fiscal 2024 from \u00a512,610 billion projected earlier to \u00a512,710 billion due to the strengthening of the G&NS unit. For fiscal 2024, sales from G&NS are likely to be \u00a54,490 billion compared with the prior view of \u00a54,320 billion. Lower hardware sales and stiff rivalry are woes. Demand for mobile sensors is likely to be affected by changes in the production plan of a key customer. At present, SONY carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2024 bottom line is pegged at earnings of $1.20 per share, unchanged in the past seven days.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

(NASDAQ:GPRO) investors has not been profitable editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Wed, Jan 8, 2025, 2:12 PM 3 min read In This Article: GPRO -8.65% Every investor on earth makes bad calls sometimes. But you want to avoid the really big losses like the plague. So spare a thought for the long term shareholders of GoPro, Inc. ( NASDAQ:GPRO ); the share price is down a whopping 89% in the last three years. That would be a disturbing experience. The more recent news is of little comfort, with the share price down 64% in a year. Furthermore, it's down 12% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders. While a drop like that is definitely a body blow, money isn't as important as health and happiness. Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. See our latest analysis for GoPro Because GoPro made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally hope to see good revenue growth. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one would hope for good top-line growth to make up for the lack of earnings. Over the last three years, GoPro's revenue dropped 8.5% per year. That is not a good result. Having said that the 24% annualized share price decline highlights the risk of investing in unprofitable companies. We're generally averse to companies with declining revenues, but we're not alone in that. There's no more than a snowball's chance in hell that share price will head back to its old highs, in the short term. You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). NasdaqGS:GPRO Earnings and Revenue Growth January 8th 2025 Take a more thorough look at GoPro's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet . A Different Perspective While the broader market gained around 26% in the last year, GoPro shareholders lost 64%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 12% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should \"buy when there is blood on the streets\", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for GoPro that you should be aware of before investing here.

{"text": "GoPro Stock Plummets 65% in the Past Year: What Should Investors Do? Zacks Equity Research Mon, Jan 6, 2025, 4:38 PM 5 min read In This Article: GPRO -8.65% QCOM -1.56% GoPro, Inc. GPRO stock has tumbled 65% in the past year against the S&P 500 composite and the sub-industry\u2019s growth of 24.4% and 12.9%, respectively. The decline can be attributed to sluggish sales in both its retail stores and GoPro.com online channel. Loss estimates for 2024 have widened to $2.44 per share from a loss of $1.05 over the past 60 days. One-Year Stock Performance Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Cut-Throat Competition, Macro Woes Hurt GPRO\u2019s Prospects San Mateo, CA-based GoPro manufactures mountable and wearable capture devices, such as action cameras and related accessories. Its core product is the HERO line of capture devices, which was initially launched in 2004. The company's latest innovations include cloud-connected HERO13 Black and the HERO, and MAX, a 360-degree waterproof camera. GPRO has been dealing with multiple challenges over the past year. Global macroeconomic uncertainty and lack of promotional efforts have led to subdued consumer spending behavior. These factors have adversely impacted discretionary spending on non-essential items like action cameras, further reducing GoPro\u2019s sales. Fierce competition in the camera and camcorder market and the delayed launch of its new 360-degree camera are added management concerns. All these have led to lower expectations of units and revenue growth in 2025 than in 2024. Revenues for 2024 are now estimated to be $800 million (+/- $10 million), down from the previous forecast of $850-$870 million. Unit sales are projected to reach 2.45 million, lower than the earlier estimate of 2.6-2.7 million. Furthermore, to maintain its market share, the company invests heavily in research and development (R&D), which puts pressure on its profit margins. While this has improved the efficiency of its R&D efforts, rising competition has led to pricing challenges, reflected in its recent price adjustments. Operating in the consumer goods sector, GoPro must also make significant investments in advertising and marketing, as inadequate spending in these areas negatively affects consumer demand. Expansion of Retail Footprint & Subscribers Aid GPRO In May 2023, the company unveiled its global retail expansion plan. Since then, it has added more than 6,300 new retail doors, bringing the total doors count to 25,000 till now. GoPro added 1,200 new retail doors across all regions in the last reported quarter, including roughly 500 Sam's Club stores in the United States. It earlier stated that it targeted adding another 3,000-6,000 new doors by the end of 2025 to boost its go-to-market capabilities for its product roadmap. GoPro has been focusing on building its subscription business, which includes unlimited cloud storage, live streaming, no-questions-asked camera replacement, discounts on cameras and a unique line of accessories. In the third quarter, subscription and service revenue grew 11% year over year to $27.5 million, driven by better retention and growth in Premium+ subscribers, leading to a 9% rise in ARPU. GoPro had 2.56 million subscribers (54,000 Premium+) at quarter-end, a 2% increase from last year. By the end of 2024, management expects subscriber numbers to remain steady at 2.55 million. To grow its base, GoPro enhanced its subscription benefits and partnered more closely with retailers in North America and globally. To drive profitability and growth, GPRO is targeting an operating cost of $250 million (+/- $5 million) for 2025, a reduction of nearly $110 million from the prior year, driven by a 26% reduction in headcount and other expenses undertaken in 2024. Story Continues End Note With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), GPRO appears to be treading in the middle of the road, and new investors could be better off if they trade with caution. The stock has been trading below both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, indicating that investors are bearish on the stock. 50 &100-Day Moving Average Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks from the broader technology space are InterDigital, Inc.

GPRO is Risky and One Stock to Buy Instead Jabin Bastian Fri, Dec 20, 2024, 12:08 PM 4 min read In This Article: GPRO -8.65% Three Reasons Why GPRO is Risky and One Stock to Buy Instead Over the last six months, GoPro\u2019s shares have sunk to $1.10, producing a disappointing 19.7% loss - a stark contrast to the S&P 500\u2019s 6% gain. This might have investors contemplating their next move. Is there a buying opportunity in GoPro, or does it present a risk to your portfolio? Dive into our full research report to see our analyst team\u2019s opinion, it\u2019s free . Even with the cheaper entry price, we don't have much confidence in GoPro. Here are three reasons why you should be careful with GPRO and a stock we'd rather own. Why Do We Think GoPro Will Underperform? Known for sponsoring extreme athletes, GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) is a camera company known for its POV videos and editing software. 1. Decline in Cameras Sold Points to Weak Demand Revenue growth can be broken down into changes in price and volume (for companies like GoPro, our preferred volume metric is cameras sold). While both are important, the latter is the most critical to analyze because prices have a ceiling. GoPro\u2019s cameras sold came in at 881,000 in the latest quarter, and over the last two years, averaged 4.5% year-on-year declines. This performance was underwhelming and implies there may be increasing competition or market saturation. It also suggests GoPro might have to lower prices or invest in product improvements to grow, factors that can hinder near-term profitability. GoPro Cameras Sold 2. New Investments Fail to Bear Fruit as ROIC Declines A company\u2019s ROIC, or return on invested capital, shows how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity). We typically prefer to invest in companies with high returns because it means they have viable business models, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is often what surprises the market and moves the stock price. Unfortunately, GoPro\u2019s ROIC has decreased significantly over the last few years. We like what management has done in the past, but its declining returns are perhaps a symptom of fewer profitable growth opportunities. GoPro Trailing 12-Month Return On Invested Capital 3. Short Cash Runway Exposes Shareholders to Potential Dilution As long-term investors, the risk we care about most is the permanent loss of capital, which can happen when a company goes bankrupt or raises money from a disadvantaged position. This is separate from short-term stock price volatility, something we are much less bothered by. GoPro burned through $60.47 million of cash over the last year. With $130.2 million of cash on its balance sheet, the company has around 26 months of runway left (assuming its $93.05 million of debt isn\u2019t due right away). GoPro Net Cash Position Unless the GoPro\u2019s fundamentals change quickly, it might find itself in a position where it must raise capital from investors to continue operating. Whether that would be favorable is unclear because dilution is a headwind for shareholder returns. Story Continues We remain cautious of GoPro until it generates consistent free cash flow or any of its announced financing plans materialize on its balance sheet. Final Judgment We see the value of companies helping consumers, but in the case of GoPro, we\u2019re out. After the recent drawdown, the stock trades at 22.6\u00d7 forward EV-to-EBITDA (or $1.10 per share). This multiple tells us a lot of good news is priced in - we think there are better investment opportunities out there. We\u2019d recommend looking at Yum! Brands, an all-weather company that owns household favorite Taco Bell . Stocks We Would Buy Instead of GoPro With rates dropping, inflation stabilizing, and the elections in the rearview mirror, all signs point to the start of a new bull run - and we\u2019re laser-focused on finding the best stocks for this upcoming cycle.

GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Nov 07, 2024 , 5:00 p.m. ET Contents: Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants Prepared Remarks: Operator Good afternoon. Thank you for attending today's GoPro third quarter 2024 earnings call. My name is Cameron, and I will be your moderator for today. All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call with an opportunity for questions and answers at the end. [Operator instructions] And I would now like to pass the conference over to your host, Christopher Clark, vice president of corporate communications. You may proceed. Christopher Clark -- Vice President of Corporate Communications Thank you, Cameron. Good afternoon and welcome to GoPro's third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. With me today are GoPro's CEO, Nicholas Woodman; and CFO and COO, Brian McGee. Today's agenda will include brief commentary from Nick, followed by Q&A. For detailed information about our third quarter 2024 performance, as well as outlook, please read our Q3 2024 earnings press release and the management commentary we've posted to the Investor Relations section of GoPro's website. Before I pass the call to Nick, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements and all other statements that are not historical facts are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially. Additionally, any forward-looking statements made today are based on assumptions as of today. Should you invest $1,000 in GoPro right now? Before you buy stock in GoPro, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and GoPro wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years. Consider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $892,313 !* Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than quadrupled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*. See the 10 stocks \u00bb *Stock Advisor returns as of November 4, 2024 This means that results could change at any time, and we do not undertake any obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. To better understand the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from our commentary, we refer you to our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and as updated in filings with the SEC, including the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Today, we may discuss margin, operating expense, net profit and loss, adjusted EBITDA, as well as basic and diluted net profit and loss per share in accordance with GAAP and on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP operating expenses can be found in the press release that was issued this afternoon, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. Story Continues Unless otherwise noted, all income statement-related numbers that are discussed in the management commentary and remarks today, other than revenue, are non-GAAP. Now, I'll turn the call over to GoPro's founder and CEO, Nicholas Woodman. Nicholas Woodman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Chris, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. Today, Brian and I will share brief remarks before going into Q&A. And I want to encourage all on the call to read the detailed management commentary we posted to our Investor Relations website. In Q3, GoPro exceeded guidance with revenue of $259 million. Subscription and service revenue grew 11% year over year to $27.5 million, primarily driven by ARPU growth of 9% and overall subscriber growth of 2%. EPS was breakeven on a non-GAAP basis, and EBITDA was $5 million, a $39 million improvement sequentially. Despite these directionally positive Q3 results, this continues to be a challenging year for GoPro as we navigate global macroeconomic headwinds impacting consumer discretionary spending, the previously mentioned delay of our new 360-degree camera, and competition. While GoPro welcomes fair competition as it encourages innovation and fosters a vibrant market for consumers, the principles of fair competition are not served by companies that seek to profit from the hard work, investment, and innovation of others. We will litigate in the interest of protecting our inventions, and we understand the time and cost associated with defending our IP. GoPro has invested substantial time, effort, and money into a culture of innovation over the past 20 years, researching and developing leading-edge technologies that have enabled new ways of capturing and new categories of cameras, whether that's being the first to enable ultrawide-angle perspectives in consumer cameras, inventing market-leading in-camera video stabilization or pioneering convenient 360-degree capture. This culture of innovation has allowed us to build a patent portfolio consistently recognized by industry experts for its quality, depth, and variety. Our patent portfolio is in place to protect our inventions and IP, and we are committed to taking action to protect these assets when necessary. Earlier this year, we filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission and a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against one of our competitors, with the goal to enforce certain GoPro patents related to our cameras and digital imaging technology. Again, GoPro welcomes fair competition, but we will litigate to protect our IP when we believe it is being infringed. As we shared in our Q2 earnings, the consumer digital imaging market is growing, driven by new products catering to consumers' growing interest in alternative forms of capture beyond the phone. We are seeing growth in the action camera market, 360-degree cameras, and other new types of cameras. We believe our product road map positions us to participate in these growth areas and more. To better position ourselves to participate in this growth as a profitable company in 2025 and beyond, we've taken a more aggressive approach to reduce 2025 operating expenses significantly below what we shared on our last earnings call. We are now targeting 2025 operating expenses of $250 million, a reduction of approximately $110 million from 2024. I want to be clear. We are not cutting our way to profitability. We are changing our approach to operate in a leaner, more focused manner that we believe will be sustainable and strategic for long-term success and improved financial performance. We are reducing our operating expenses to the lowest level since before going public while pursuing a product road map we believe will drive innovation, differentiation, and growth. In September, we launched two new products. Our flagship HERO13 Black is loaded with leading-edge technology, performance, and convenience that includes a suite of innovative new lens mods that massively enhance a user's creative potential. We also launched our new entry-level camera, the tiny HERO camera. Priced at $199, HERO is our most affordable camera, making it ideal for travelers, creators, families, kids, adventure seekers, and gift-givers looking for the simplest, lightest 4K GoPro. And importantly, HERO has been newly designed from the ground up to yield a better profit margin than our previous entry-level cameras. And we continue to execute on the global retail expansion strategy we announced in May 2023, having added approximately 6,300 new doors since then, bringing our total doors to over 25,000. In Q3, we added more than 1,200 doors globally, including approximately 500 Sam's Clubs doors in the U.S. Expanding our global retail footprint to this level not only allows us to reach more consumers with our current products but also serves as an important foundation for future launches as we expand our product offerings. In summary, we are working through our business challenges and feel good about our go-forward strategy. We are reducing 2025 operating expenses to the lowest level since before going public while pursuing a product road map we believe will drive innovation, differentiation, and growth. We are excited to operate GoPro in a leaner manner as we believe it will yield better execution, efficiency, and improved financial performance. Now, I'll pass the call to Brian to share some details on our financials and outlook. Brian McGee -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Operating Officer Thanks, Nick. I'd like to first share some notable business highlights. In Q3, subscription and service revenue grew 11% year over year to $27.5 million, primarily from 9% ARPU growth, driven by improving our aggregate retention rate, which was up 4% year over year to 67%, as well as growth of our Premium+ subscribers. Also, in Q3, subscribers grew 2% year over year to 2.56 million, including 54,000 Premium+ subscribers and subscription attach rate from cameras sold across all channels was 45%, in line with prior year attach rates. Third quarter EBITDA was positive $5 million, a $39 million sequential improvement. For the second half of 2024, gross margin is expected to be 36%, a 250-basis-point improvement year over year, as we have outlined in the first half of 2024. Turning to the balance sheet. We expect cash to be approximately $125 million at the end of the year. We recently conducted a restructuring to reduce operating expenses by $110 million to approximately $250 million in 2025, down from $360 million in 2024. Looking ahead to 2025, we expect units and revenue to be lower than 2024, primarily driven by macroeconomic headwinds, competition, and the delay of our new 360-degree camera, which we expect to launch in 2025. We anticipate Street ASP to be in a range of $335 to $345 in 2025, a 5% improvement over 2024. We expect gross margin to improve from 34% in 2024 to a range of 35% to 36% in 2025. We expect our operating expenses to be between $245 million and $255 million as a result of the 26% reduction in headcount and other expense reductions taken in 2024. This represents an annual reduction of $110 million from projected 2024 spending and represents the lowest level of operating expenses since before becoming a publicly listed company. In addition, our expectation is for first quarter of 2025 operating expense level of approximately $60 million, or down nearly 30% year over year. We believe this annual level of spend enables us to pursue a diversified and innovative road map that we believe will extend GoPro's leadership in the markets we serve and restore unit and revenue growth in 2026. In summary, as we work through our business challenges, we are adjusting GoPro's operating model to be more efficient to yield improved financial results. We are excited about 2025 where we expect to launch new products while preserving cash to repay our debt, and importantly, position ourselves for profitability in 2025. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Questions & Answers: Operator We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] And we will pause here briefly as questions are registered. The first question is from the line of Martin Yang with Oppenheimer. You may proceed. Martin Yang -- Analyst Thank you for taking my question. My first question is about the litigation. What do you consider as the ideal outcome of the USITC investigation? Nicholas Woodman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hi, Martin. Thanks for that. The litigation is to defend our IP, which we believe is being infringed. And what I can say is that the ideal outcome is that the ITC would recognize this infringement and validate the validity of our patents and our IP and that any products that are being sold into the United States market that are infringing, sold in by the company in question, that they would no longer be able to sell those products in the United States market. Martin Yang -- Analyst Got it. Is there any timeline or expected date for the investigation to conclude? Nicholas Woodman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer We expect, in general terms, a conclusion in 2025. Martin Yang -- Analyst Got it. Thank you. My next question is on the 2025 outlook. If you were to rank the different headwinds you outlined, what would be the most impactful to the 2025 outlook? What would be the least impactful? And how do you reconcile the number of retail doors that you have grown over the year to that reduced outlook? Brian McGee -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Operating Officer Yeah. Maybe I'll start, and Nick, you can come over the top. Macroeconomic is probably one of the biggest. We're seeing that here in the U.S. China in the third quarter was down significantly as a market. They're having their issues. We finally saw a little bit of sliding in Europe. Europe has been a stronger market for us, followed by we have to get our new 360 camera out, Martin. So, that's a market that's growing. You see that across Circana and GfK. So, we need to get that product in the market and resume selling. And of course, there's competition. So, I would put them in that order. We got to get products out into the market. Martin Yang -- Analyst Got it. My final question on competition, do you see most of the share erosion happening on the 360-degree camera category? Or do you see more happening for the main camera, the action camera category? Brian McGee -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Operating Officer I'll start. Nick, if you want to chime in. Nicholas Woodman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I think the biggest -- Brian McGee -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Operating Officer Go ahead. Sure. Nicholas Woodman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer No, no, you go ahead. Brian McGee -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Operating Officer Yeah. I would say that the action camera category one is actually growing slightly. And we're seeing -- if you think about alternative capture, 360, it's definitely been a growth category. Again, I'll reiterate, that's why we need to get a product back in the market. And there's other forms of capture that are growing as well, particularly in blogging. So, those are areas of opportunity for us to grow into those markets. Nicholas Woodman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I would say the biggest share hit, Martin, is in 360 due to the delay of the launch of our new camera. We are seeing some share erosion in the HERO camera category -- action category as well. The biggest revenue impact, though, is coming from us not launching our MAX 2 360 camera. And as it relates to reconciliating the new door growth globally with sell-through and some of the challenges that we're facing, be it macroeconomic, not having launched our 360 camera or some competition, I'd say that while we're really excited about the 25,000-plus doors that we're in now and all of the new merchandising that's gone out, it's obviously very helpful. But when we don't have our full suite of products out in the market, then obviously, we're not fully exploiting that retail network and that really strong in-store presence. So, while that's something that's hurting us in 2024, that's something we believe is going to help us in 2025 when we get our full suite of new products out, including MAX 2 in 2025. So, unfortunately, we're not realizing the full benefit of the 25,000-plus doors today, but we expect to realize the full benefit in 2025. So, there's a number of positive factors that we believe are going to contribute to a stronger 2025, that 25,000-plus door count that will continue to grow, the launch of new products to fill those doors, including our new 360 camera MAX 2, and more. So, quite a bit to look forward to. But yes, there's no denying that we've got a bit of a path between here and there. Martin Yang -- Analyst Got it. That's it for me. Thank you, Nick. Thank you, Brian. Nicholas Woodman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Martin. Operator There are currently no questions registered. [Operator instructions] There are no additional questions waiting at this time. I would like to pass the conference over to the management team for any closing remarks. Nicholas Woodman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, operator. Well, thanks for joining the call today, everybody. I'd like to remind everyone that while we are facing some business challenges, we're actually quite excited about the future. The opex reductions that we've made and the opex target that we have in 2025 of approximately $250 million is a sustainable, strategic effort to operate GoPro in a much leaner, more efficient, and more effective manner that we think is not only going to help improve execution and yield better financial results, but we're confident that it's going to enable us to continue to drive innovation, differentiation into our product road map to allow us to participate in the growth that we're seeing in the digital imaging market. Our market opportunity is in what we consider alternative capture cameras. That is cameras that go beyond the capabilities of the phone, go beyond the capabilities of traditional cameras, and our innovations and product development is really focused at helping people capture, document their lives, their experiences either for personal enjoyment or for their careers, for professional, commercial purposes in ways that just simply would be convenient with a traditional phone or a camera. And these categories of cameras are growing. The proliferation of cameras, be they as stand-alone cameras or cameras that are embedded into other devices or equipment or gear, or vehicles, is growing. And GoPro's tech stack, expertise, and brand are uniquely well-positioned for us to develop as an enabler of these types of capture use cases. Historically, we've been known as the HERO camera company. And while that's been terrific for growing our business and our brand over time, it's a subset of what GoPro is capable of. It's a subset of what our product development and engineering teams are capable of. It's a subset of what our existing distribution is capable of getting in front of consumers. And ultimately, it's been a subset of the greater opportunity for our brand and business to exploit all of the incredible people, the incredible talent, the incredible technology that we've developed over the years, including, as I mentioned, the incredible patent portfolio that we have that we're now defending, and we will put to use going forward in new ways. So, the opportunity ahead is very significant for us. We've moved through the challenges of 2024, and we're really looking forward to executing in 2025 as a leaner, meaner organization that's really focused on efficiency and execution in the process of getting out exciting new products that we believe are going to help us grow our business. So, while this is a challenging, immediate moment in GoPro's history, we're really looking forward to the changes that we've made in the business and putting those changes to use in a more efficient operating model in 2025. So, with that, thank you, everybody, for joining today's call. We're looking forward to our next one with you at the beginning of next year. And until then, this is Team GoPro signing off.

Article: GPRO -8.65% DLB +0.49% GoPro (GPRO) reported break-even quarterly earnings per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.04. This compares to earnings of $0.04 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 100%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this action video camera maker would post a loss of $0.25 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.24, delivering a surprise of 4%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. GoPro , which belongs to the Zacks Audio Video Production industry, posted revenues of $258.9 million for the quarter ended September 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.56%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $294.3 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. GoPro shares have lost about 58.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 24.3%. What's Next for GoPro? While GoPro has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for GoPro: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) reported Q3 CY2024 results topping the market\u2019s revenue expectations , but sales fell 12% year on year to $258.9 million. Its non-GAAP loss of $0 per share was also 100% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy GoPro? Find out in our full research report . GoPro (GPRO) Q3 CY2024 Highlights: Revenue: $258.9 million vs analyst estimates of $255 million (1.5% beat) Adjusted EPS: $0 vs analyst estimates of -$0.04 ($0.04 beat) EBITDA: $5.45 million vs analyst estimates of -$3.97 million (237% beat) Gross Margin (GAAP): 35.5%, up from 32% in the same quarter last year Operating Margin: -3.1%, down from -1.3% in the same quarter last year EBITDA Margin: 2.1%, in line with the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow was -$4.19 million compared to -$1.66 million in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $219.9 million \"While 2024 has been a challenging year for GoPro, the consumer digital imaging market is growing, and we believe our product roadmap will enable us to grow with it. And we believe our reduced operating expenses in 2025 to approximately $250 million will position us to pursue this growth opportunity as a profitable company,\" said Nicholas Woodman, GoPro's founder and CEO. Company Overview Known for sponsoring extreme athletes, GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) is a camera company known for its POV videos and editing software. Consumer Electronics Consumer electronics companies aim to address the evolving leisure and entertainment needs of consumers, who are increasingly familiar with technology in everyday life. Whether it\u2019s speakers for the home or specialized cameras to document everything from a surfing session to a wedding reception, these businesses are trying to provide innovative, high-quality products that are both useful and cool to own. Adding to the degree of difficulty for these companies is technological change, where the latest smartphone could disintermediate a whole category of consumer electronics. Companies that successfully serve customers and innovate can enjoy high customer loyalty and pricing power, while those that struggle with these may go the way of the VHS tape. Sales Growth A company\u2019s long-term performance can indicate its business quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. GoPro\u2019s demand was weak over the last five years as its sales fell by 3% annually, a rough starting point for our analysis. GoPro Total Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within consumer discretionary, a stretched historical view may miss a company riding a successful new product or emerging trend. GoPro\u2019s recent history shows its demand has stayed suppressed as its revenue has declined by 12.3% annually over the last two years. Story Continues GoPro Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, GoPro\u2019s revenue fell 12% year on year to $258.9 million but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 1.5%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 2.8% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus the last two years. While this projection illustrates the market believes its newer products and services will spur better performance, it is still below average for the sector. When a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares. Click here to claim your Special Free Report on a fallen angel growth story that is already recovering from a setback . Cash Is King Free cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king. Over the last two years, GoPro\u2019s demanding reinvestments to stay relevant have drained its resources. Its free cash flow margin averaged negative 5.8%, meaning it lit $5.85 of cash on fire for every $100 in revenue. GoPro Free Cash Flow Margin GoPro burned through $4.19 million of cash in Q3, equivalent to a negative 1.6% margin. The company\u2019s cash burn was similar to its $1.66 million of lost cash in the same quarter last year. Over the next year, analysts predict GoPro\u2019s cash conversion will improve to break even. Their consensus estimates imply its free cash flow margin of negative 6.7% for the last 12 months will increase by 6.6 percentage points. Key Takeaways from GoPro\u2019s Q3 Results We were impressed by how significantly GoPro blew past analysts\u2019 EPS expectations this quarter. We were also excited its revenue and EBITDA outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Zooming out, we think this was a good quarter with some key areas of upside. The stock remained flat at $1.46 immediately after reporting. GoPro put up rock-solid earnings, but one quarter doesn\u2019t necessarily make the stock a buy. Let\u2019s see if this is a good investment. When making that decision, it\u2019s important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it\u2019s free .

{"text": "Time To Worry? Analysts Just Downgraded Their GoPro, Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRO) Outlook editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 2:04 PM 2 min read In This Article: GPRO -8.65% The latest analyst coverage could presage a bad day for GoPro, Inc. ( NASDAQ:GPRO ), with the analysts making across-the-board cuts to their statutory estimates that might leave shareholders a little shell-shocked. This report focused on revenue estimates, and it looks as though the consensus view of the business has become substantially more conservative. Bidders are definitely seeing a different story, with the stock price of US$1.65 reflecting a 23% rise in the past week. With such a sharp increase, it seems brokers may have seen something that is not yet being priced in by the wider market. Following the downgrade, the consensus from three analysts covering GoPro is for revenues of US$753m in 2025, implying a chunky 16% decline in sales compared to the last 12 months. Before the latest update, the analysts were foreseeing US$920m of revenue in 2025. The consensus view seems to have become more pessimistic on GoPro, noting the measurable cut to revenue estimates in this update. See our latest analysis for GoPro NasdaqGS:GPRO Earnings and Revenue Growth November 12th 2024 Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. One more thing stood out to us about these estimates, and it's the idea that GoPro's decline is expected to accelerate, with revenues forecast to fall at an annualised rate of 13% to the end of 2025. This tops off a historical decline of 1.4% a year over the past five years. Compare this against analyst estimates for companies in the broader industry, which suggest that revenues (in aggregate) are expected to grow 5.8% annually. So it's pretty clear that, while it does have declining revenues, the analysts also expect GoPro to suffer worse than the wider industry. The Bottom Line The most important thing to take away is that analysts cut their revenue estimates for next year. They also expect company revenue to perform worse than the wider market. Overall, given the drastic downgrade to next year's forecasts, we'd be feeling a little more wary of GoPro going forwards. Need some more information?
