in documentary on vegan dog food PR Newswire Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 10:00 PM 3 min read POMONA, Calif. , Jan. 22, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- A study led by two Western University of Health Sciences College of Veterinary Medicine professors demonstrated that dogs fed nutritionally-sound vegan diets maintain health outcomes as well as dogs fed meat. This study is now the subject of a documentary by Academy Award-winning director Louie Psihoyos , produced by the Oceanic Preservation Society (OPS) and streaming on Netflix Tudum. Stream here: Can Dogs Live on a Plant-Based Diet? You Are What You Eat Explores the Answer - Netflix Tudum Western University of Health Sciences College of Veterinary Medicine Professor Tonatiuh Melgarejo, DVM, MS, PhD, (left) and CVM Associate Professor Annika Linde, DVM, PhD, MPH, published a study examining the health effects of a plant-based diet on dogs. That study is now the subject of a documentary featured on Netflix Tudum. (Jeff Malet, WesternU) The short film, \"Can Dogs Live on a Plant-based Diet?\" explores the clinical study by WesternU College of Veterinary Medicine Associate Professor Annika Linde , DVM, PhD, MPH, and CVM Professor Tonatiuh Melgarejo , DVM, MS, PhD, presented at the 2023 Western Veterinary Conference and published in April 2024 in PLOS One. Domestic dogs maintain clinical, nutritional, and hematological health outcomes when fed a commercial plant-based diet for a year | PLOS ONE The study examined the effects of a plant-based diet on 15 dogs over the course of one year. The dogs were given complete physical examinations, extensive blood and urine analyses, including nutritional and cardiac biomarkers \u2013 more than 3,000 parameters. Overweight or obese dogs lost weight, while the remainder maintained normal weight over the course of a year. No clinically significant changes occurred within blood and urine. The documentary reveals some surprising results. Vitamin D is very important for bone metabolism and immunity. Seven of the 15 dogs entered the study with vitamin D insufficiency. At the end of the study, all 15 dogs were within normal limits for vitamin D. The documentary also delves into the potential environmental impacts of shifting dogs (and cats) to a plant-based diet. The amount of meat used to feed dogs and cats in the U.S. is equivalent to the meat consumption in Italy \u2013 4.3 million tons, Dr. Melgarejo says in the film. If all dogs and cats in the U.S. had their own country, they would be the fifth largest meat-eating country in the world. An estimated 30% of the total carbon footprint for food production in the U.S. comes from dog and cat food, he said. \"To make matters worse, we are seeing dogs with similar health problems as people have on a diet that is heavy on animal products, like obesity and certain cancers,\" Melgarejo said. \"Dogs and cats are not going to go away, and we need to provide a sustainable, healthier food, not only for the dogs, but for our planet.\" Story Continues About Western University of Health Sciences Western University of Health Sciences ( www.westernu.edu ), located in Pomona, Calif. and Lebanon, Ore. , is an independent nonprofit health professions university, conferring degrees in biotechnology and pharmaceutical sciences, dental medicine, medical sciences, nursing, optometry, osteopathic medicine, pharmacy, \u00a0physical therapy, physician assistant studies, podiatric medicine and veterinary medicine.

detecting bird flu in raw pet food Eduardo Cuevas, USA TODAY Sat, Jan 18, 2025, 3:28 AM 2 min read Manufacturers of raw dog and cat food must do a better job detecting bird flu in products sold to pet owners, federal regulators announced Friday. Several cats , wild and domestic, in the U.S. have contracted H5N1 avian influenza and died from eating raw food contaminated with bird flu. Raw foods include unpasteurized milk, uncooked meat or unpasteurized eggs. The raw pet food industry has grown rapidly despite recalls and health warnings, according to USA TODAY reporting. Pasteurization , the established process of heat treatment, can inactivate viruses, including H5N1 and other pathogens in food. Under the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s update Friday , officials said regulated cat and dog food manufacturers who sell uncooked or unpasteurized products must reanalyze food safety plans to include bird flu as a threat. The update is meant \u201cto ensure that cat and dog food manufacturers are aware of information about the new H5N1 hazard associated with their pet food products,\u201d FDA officials said. A concern from pets getting sick with bird flu is that they can potentially infect people. Humans infected with bird flu have largely had mild infections , with no spread between others. Research suggests cats , who can carry bird flu and human influenza viruses, can serve as mixing vessels that would allow the bird flu virus to mutate and become more likely to infect people. In some cases it could even cause more severe disease. Cats especially can have severe illness and death from bird flu. In Washington, 20 wild cats died at an animal sanctuary from raw food. Domestic cats have died in California , Colorado and Oregon from their owners giving them raw meat or milk products that were subsequently recalled. Dogs can also contract H5N1, though no cases have been identified in the U.S. so far. Under an FDA rule, certain animal food companies must have a food safety plan identifying and evaluating hazards for foods they manufacture, process, pack or hold at their facilities. The rule requires regulated companies to re-analyze their food safety plans when FDA determines it\u2019s necessary, which is the case with the known transmission with bird flu for raw food products. FDA encouraged pet food manufacturers and others in supply chains to use practices to \u201csignificantly minimize or prevent\u201d bird flu transmission via animal food, including with pasteurization . Companies should obtain meat, milk or eggs from flocks or herds that are healthy.

Morgan Healthcare Conference PR Newswire Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 2:00 AM 7 min read In This Article: IVBIY -12.95% IVBXF +0.95% Advancing into new stage of sustainable growth and global innovation SAN FRANCISCO and SUZHOU, China , Jan. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Innovent Biologics, Inc. (\"Innovent\") (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology, cardiovascular and metabolic, autoimmune, ophthalmology and other major diseases, participated in the 43 rd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. During the conference, Dr. De- Chao Michael Yu , Founder, Chairman and CEO of Innovent , delivered a presentation highlighting 2025 as a pivotal year for significantly business growth and concreate steps in global innovation. These efforts will further strengthen the foundation for Innovent's vision of becoming a global premier biopharma company. Clear path to sustainable growth Innovent has established itself as a leading brand in oncology, consistently gaining momentum with an expanding portfolio of synergistic products. Additionally, another key growth driver, the general biomedicine segment, features a highly competitive product lineup, poised to unlock the substantial opportunities in chronic disease areas. The company remains confident in achieving its domestic product revenue target of 20 billion RMB by 2027. Alongside rapid business growth, Innovent continues to enhance operational efficiency through effective and lean management practices, ensuring sustainable and healthy operating model. Focus on world-class technology platforms and key therapeutic areas Innovent Academy, the company's innovation engine, has built a world-class technology platform, encompassing ScFv engineering, T cell engager (TCE), VHH bispecific antibodies, Topo1i ADC, dual payload ADC, and antibody peptide conjugates (APC). These platforms have consistently delivered innovative molecules, providing a driving force for the company's long-term development. In particular, Innovent combines its world-class antibody engineering and multiple sets of differentiated linker payload technologies to create the TOPO1i ADC technology platform (SoloTx) and dual payload ADC technology platform (DuetTx), producing a pipeline of potential best-in-class (BIC) or first-in-class ( FIC) ADC candidates. The company has so far advanced 8 ADC candidates into clinic trials, supported by efficacy and safety data from over 600 patients, with multiple ADCs receiving breakthrough therapy designation (BTD). This further validates the differentiated advantage of the company's ADC platform technology and its strong clinical execution. Story Continues Innovent continues to focus on high-potential therapeutic areas in oncology and general biomedicine. The \"PD-1+precision therapies\" pipeline strengthens its leadership in oncology, while the \"IO+ADC\" strategy is set to transform cancer treatment. Meanwhile, its general biomedicine pipeline covers next generation treatments for autoimmune, cardiovascular and metabolic, and ophthalmic diseases, aiming to elevate treatment standards for diverse patient populations. Embracing new opportunities in global innovation Innovent Academy's advancements have paved the way for a globally competitive pipeline of next generation IO and ADC candidates. The company plans to expand into innovative ADCs, bispecific (multi-specific) antibodies, and next-generation autoimmune and CVM therapies for global development. IBI343 (CLDN18.2\u00a0ADC): Phase 3 multi-regional clinical trial (MRCT) has been initiated in China and Japan for gastric cancer. Pancreatic cancer MRCT clinical Phase 1 data shows positive efficacy and safety signals in Chinese patients and has started patient enrollment in the U.S. Pivotal clinical trials are anticipated in 2025, subject to PoC validation. IBI363\uff1aThis first-in-class PD-1/IL-2\u03b1-biased\u00a0bispecific antibody has shown promising Phase 1 clinical data, obtained from hundreds of patients in IO resistant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, and IO unresponsive \"cold tumor\" colorectal cancer (CRC). This points to its potential as the next generation IO cornerstone drug. Innovent is following up on the Phase 1b /2 expansion cohorts of these cancer types. Pivotal clinical studies in IO-resistant advanced squamous NSCLC and IO-na\u00efve advanced melanoma are planned to launch in China in 2025, subject to PoC data and regulatory communication. A Phase 2 clinical study is ongoing in the U.S. and will further expand into cohorts for NSCLC, CRC, and melanoma. IBI3009 (DLL3\u00a0ADC): Through global licensing collaboration with Roche, Innovent aims to accelerate the development of this potentially best-in-class DLL3 ADC for small cell lung cancer patients worldwide. 2025 outlook: unlocking growth opportunities Looking ahead in 2025, the company anticipates a year of rapid growth, driven by six new drug launches and further advancements in commercialization across oncology and general biomedicine. Key highlights include: Mazdutide (GCG/GLP-1): Expected approvals for weight loss and type 2 diabetes indications in the first and second half of 2025, respectively, will provide a best-in-class GCG/GLP-1 dual agonist drug offering robust weight loss and glucose reduction, substantial liver fat reduction as well as comprehensive metabolic benefits for the vast obese, overweight and diabetes population; Teprotumumab (IGF-1R): Anticipated launch as China's first anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody for thyroid eye disease (TED), addressing a 60-year treatment gap. Picankibart (IL-23p19): Approval anticipated by late 2025. Picankibart is the first globally to report that over 80% of subjects achieved PASI 90 (\u226590% improvement in psoriasis area and severity index) within 16 weeks of treatment. It also demonstrates clear advantages, including sustained long-term efficacy, effective in patients resistant to IL-17 inhibitors, and flexibility with seasonal dosing intervals. Picankibart is poised to deliver exceptional comprehensive benefits to psoriasis patients in China . As the company advances key cornerstone products in its pipeline, we are actively expanding the development of mazdutide, teprotumumab, and picankibart into additional indications to maximize the portfolio's value. Building on this solid foundation, next-generation candidates are gradually entering clinical development, aiming to address global challenges related to aging and chronic disease burden. These innovations focus on extending dosing intervals, oral delivery, and novel mechanisms of action. Looking ahead to 2025, the company plans to submit NDAs or conduct ongoing registrational trials for seven drugs, while initiating pivotal or registrational trials for seven innovative pipeline candidates, pending PoC results. Additionally, molecules with global potential and novel mechanisms of action (MoAs) will progress into PoC and first-in-human studies.

2028 issued by the Issuer (CUSIP: 05501W AC6 / U0551Y AC9, ISIN: US05501WAC64/USU0551YAC94) (the \"Existing Notes\") for newly issued 11.930% Senior Secured First Out Notes due 2028 to be issued by

5:00 PM 7 min read In This Article: CVM -3.16% A 212-patient Confirmatory Registration Study for Multikine in PD-L1 low newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients is currently in final stage of start-up preparations - full enrollment expected by Q2 2026 Plans to seek early approval based on pre-surgical response rates A positive study outcome will position Multikine as the first treatment in over 50 years for newly diagnosed locally advanced head and neck cancer patients \u2013 a population with a severe unmet medical need Development of Multikine in other cancers is planned VIENNA, Va., January 14, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--CEL-SCI Corporation (NYSE American: CVM) reported financial results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, as well as key clinical and corporate developments. \"We are very optimistic about the prospects of our investigational drug Multikine in 2025 and 2026. We look ahead to Multikine being able to deliver much needed relief to a patient population with a severe unmet medical need. We see several very important milestones and value drivers upcoming. Positive data on presurgical response rates, previously shown to be indicative of overall survival, could enable us to apply for early approval,\" stated CEL-SCI CEO, Geert Kersten. \"This confirmatory Registration Study is designed to do two things: create a new standard of care for newly diagnosed treatment na\u00efve locally advanced head and neck cancer patients; and provide survival benefit for the population of patients with low/negative tumor expression of PD-L1, those patients who have historically not responded well to widely used checkpoint inhibitors such as Keytruda and Opdivo.\" Clinical and Corporate Developments: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave CEL-SCI the \u2018go-ahead\u2019 to conduct a confirmatory 212-patient Registration Study of Multikine in the treatment of locally advanced head and neck cancer based on strong safety and efficacy data from the completed Phase 3 study which enrolled 928 patients. The FDA agreed with the pre-surgical selection of patients most likely to benefit from Multikine\u2014those with newly diagnosed locally advanced primary head and neck cancer with no lymph node involvement (determined via PET scan) and with low PD-L1 tumor expression (determined via biopsy). In this target population in the completed Phase 3 study, Multikine demonstrated a 5-year survival of 73% vs a 45% survival in the control patients and a hazard ratio of 0.35. A report on the FDA\u2019s agreement and Multikine\u2019s path forward is available on CEL-SCI\u2019s website and at the following LINK . Story Continues CEL-SCI selected Ergomed, a clinical research organization (CRO) with a strong track record of fast enrollment and high-quality study delivery, as the CRO for its relatively small registration study. Ergomed has been a strategic partner and collaborator for over 10 years and was instrumental in successfully completing the Phase 3 study. Data from an analysis of CEL-SCI\u2019s Phase 3 study were shared at the International Drug Discovery Science & Technology (IDDST) 20th Annual Congress in a presentation titled \"Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy for Head and Neck Cancer: Low Tumor PD-L1 Expression - IT-MATTERS \u2013 RCT\". Highlights of the presentation include: Multikine significantly increases overall survival in patients with low levels of tumor cell PD-L1 expression, a population in which approved checkpoint inhibitors, which inhibit PD-L1, are generally not successful 73% survival for Multikine vs 45% in the control arm at 5 years Statistically significant log rank p = 0.0015 5-year risk of death reduced in half from 55% to 27% Hazard ratio = 0.35 (95% CIs [0.19, 0.66], Wald p=0.0015) The presentation may be accessed on CEL-SCI\u2019s website at the following LINK New data from the Phase 3 study were also presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2024 Congress in a poster titled \"Prognostic significance of diagnostic staging in treatment na\u00efve, resectable locally advanced primary oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma for neoadjuvant Leukocyte Interleukin Injection immunotherapy\". Positive regulatory decision letters were received from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Paediatric Committee and the United Kingdom\u2019s Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) granting Multikine a product-specific waiver for the treatment of head and neck cancer in a pediatric population up to 18 years of age. As a result, CEL-SCI is not required to evaluate Multikine in a pediatric population as part of its license and marketing clearance review in the UK and in the European Union (EU). A patient population analysis of CEL-SCI\u2019s Phase 3 study demonstrated well-balanced populations for both overall population and the selected population for the upcoming Registration Study (N0, PD-L1 low) , providing greater confidence in the clinical results of the confirmatory Registration Study. This bias analysis, a standard process to ensure a trial\u2019s findings are reliable, analyzed detailed data on parameters including patient age, sex, race, tumor locations, and staging, demonstrating a balance between the treatment and control arms. No bias favoring Multikine treated patients was found, lending confidence that Multikine is the reason for the large increase in patient survival. CEL-SCI\u2019s cGMP state-of-the-art dedicated manufacturing facility commissioning was completed , a significant milestone toward regulatory approval of Multikine. Financial Results During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses were $18.2 million, which decreased by approximately $4.3 million, or 19%, compared to the year ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative expenses in fiscal 2024 were $8.2 million, which decreased by approximately $0.8 million, or 9%, compared to the year ended September 30, 2023. Net loss decreased by $4.6 million to approximately $26.9 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 from $32.2 million in fiscal 2023. The operating cash expenditures for the year were approximately $18.8 million. CEL-SCI\u2019s audited financial statements contained an audit opinion from its independent registered public accounting firm that included an explanatory paragraph related to CEL-SCI\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. About CEL-SCI Corporation CEL-SCI believes that boosting a patient\u2019s immune system while it is still intact should provide the greatest possible impact on survival. Multikine is designed to help the immune system \"target\" the tumor at a time when the immune system is still relatively intact and thereby thought to be better able to mount an attack on the tumor. Multikine (Leukocyte Interleukin, Injection), a true first-line cancer therapy, has been dosed in over 740 patients and received Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for neoadjuvant therapy in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (cancer) of the head and neck. Based on the data from the completed randomized controlled Phase 3 study, the FDA concurred with CEL-SCI\u2019s target patient selection criteria and gave the go-ahead to conduct a confirmatory Registration Study which will enroll 212 patients. CEL-SCI will enroll newly diagnosed locally advanced primary treatment na\u00efve resectable head and neck cancer patients with no lymph node involvement (determined via PET scan) and with low PD-L1 tumor expression (determined via biopsy), representing about 100,000 patients annually. The Company has operations in Vienna, Virginia, and near/in Baltimore, Maryland.
