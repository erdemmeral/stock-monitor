Ainos' AI Nose Programs and Strategic Milestones for 2025 Ainos, Inc. Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 6:00 PM 6 min read In This Article: AIMD -6.62% AIMDW 0.00% SAN DIEGO, CA / ACCESS Newswire / January 21, 2025 / Ainos, Inc. (NASDAQ:AIMD)(NASDAQ:AIMDW) (\"Ainos\" or the \"Company\"), a pioneer of digiting scent and low-dose interferon therapeutics, today announced that Water Tower Research (\"WTR\") has published a report projecting increased visibility for the Company's transformative AI Nose programs. The report emphasizes anticipated progress for AI Nose across multiple sectors, including robotics, smart manufacturing, elderly care, and women's health. Key Highlights from the Report: AI Nose Technology: Ainos' Flagship Innovation Robotics Integration: WTR noted that Ainos's strategic focus on positioning its AI Nose technology as a critical sensory enhancement for robotics and humanoid applications. The Company is actively seeking partnerships to integrate olfactory capabilities, addressing a pivotal gap in robot functionality. Smart Manufacturing: In collaboration with Japanese partners, Ainos has developed a Volatile Organic Compounds (\"VOC\") sensing program with nearly 80% accuracy in identifying 22 VOCs across 761 test samples at semiconductor factories. WTR highlighted Ainos' plans for mass production by 1H2025, signaling significant potential in smart factory applications. Elderly Care Monitoring: The report emphasizes Ainos' efforts to address Japan's aging population with an AI-driven telehealth system for long-term care facilities. The system monitors the elderly's hygiene and health by detecting VOCs linked to bowel movements and urine, with mass production also targeted for 1H2025. This program could facilitate the growing elderly care challenges in Japan's aging population. By 2040, Japan is projected to face a shortfall of approximately 570,000 caregivers, with a third of its population aged 65 and older. Ainos Flora: Transforming Women's Health Testing The first-generation Ainos Flora device, featuring non-invasive, handheld, portable, and reusable characteristics, demonstrated up to 94% accuracy in detecting vaginal infections and common sexually transmitted infections (\"STIs\") during clinical trials. The second-generation Ainos Flora, optimized for at-home testing, is slated to begin clinical studies in 1H25. This development aligns with the growing demand for POCT, which currently represents approximately 31% of all STI tests, reflecting a large market opportunity. VELDONA \u00ae Clinical Trials Remain on Track Clinical trials in Taiwan on Sjogren's syndrome and HIV-related oral warts are expected to begin in 1H25, with completion anticipated in 2026. Animal health application for feline chronic gingivostomatitis (\"FCGS\") is on track for completion in 1H25. Ainos plans to submit Investigational New Drug (\"IND\") applications for U.S. trials by 2H25, paving the way for global therapeutic expansion. Story Continues Strategic Partnerships and Business Model WTR highlighted Ainos' commitment to driving innovation while leveraging partnerships for manufacturing, distribution, and commercialization. This approach enables Ainos to focus its capital on product design and development. Ainos is actively engaging in discussions to establish partnerships for the Veldona program to advance the regulatory process and expand development across additional countries.
