[{"text": "3 Reasons to Avoid HAIN and 1 Stock to Buy Instead Petr Hu\u0159\u0165\u00e1k Tue, Jan 28, 2025, 12:03 PM 3 min read In This Article: HAIN -5.14% 3 Reasons to Avoid HAIN and 1 Stock to Buy Instead What a brutal six months it\u2019s been for Hain Celestial. The stock has dropped 26.5% and now trades at $5.45, rattling many shareholders. This was partly driven by its softer quarterly results and might have investors contemplating their next move. Is there a buying opportunity in Hain Celestial, or does it present a risk to your portfolio? Get the full breakdown from our expert analysts, it\u2019s free . Despite the more favorable entry price, we don't have much confidence in Hain Celestial. Here are three reasons why you should be careful with HAIN and a stock we'd rather own. Why Do We Think Hain Celestial Will Underperform? Sold in over 75 countries around the world, Hain Celestial (NASDAQ:HAIN) is a natural and organic food company whose products range from snacks to teas to baby food. 1. Core Business Falling Behind as Demand Declines When analyzing revenue growth, we care most about organic revenue growth. This metric captures a business\u2019s performance excluding one-time events such as mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures as well as foreign currency fluctuations. Hain Celestial\u2019s demand has been falling over the last eight quarters, and on average, its organic sales have declined by 3.1% year on year. Hain Celestial Year-On-Year Organic Revenue Growth 2. Projected Revenue Growth Shows Limited Upside Forecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company\u2019s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite. Over the next 12 months, sell-side analysts expect Hain Celestial\u2019s revenue to stall. While this projection suggests its newer products will fuel better top-line performance, it is still below the sector average. 3. EPS Trending Down We track the change in earnings per share (EPS) because it highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable. Sadly for Hain Celestial, its EPS declined by more than its revenue over the last three years, dropping 38.5% annually. This tells us the company struggled because its fixed cost base made it difficult to adjust to shrinking demand. Hain Celestial Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) Final Judgment We see the value of companies helping consumers, but in the case of Hain Celestial, we\u2019re out. Following the recent decline, the stock trades at 11.2\u00d7 forward price-to-earnings (or $5.45 per share). This valuation multiple is fair, but we don\u2019t have much confidence in the company. There are better investments elsewhere. Let us point you toward one of the fastest-growing restaurant franchises with an A+ ranch dressing sauce .

With rates dropping and inflation cooling, many analysts expect a breakout market - and we\u2019re zeroing in on the stocks that could benefit immensely.

- Garner Insights The global organic snacks market size was valued at USD 8.45 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow to USD 9.22 billion in 2025, reaching USD 16.35 billion by 2033, expanding at a robust CAGR of 7.5% during the forecast period (2025-2033). New York, United States, Jan. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The organic snacks industry consists of food from organic materials devoid of synthetic additives, chemicals, or genetically modified organisms (GMOs). These snacks target health-conscious consumers desiring clean-label items that correspond with their lifestyle choices. The expansion of the worldwide organic snacks market is propelled by heightened consumer awareness regarding health and sustainability. In 2024, the international food corporation Nestl\u00e9 enhanced its line by introducing organic snack bars branded as \"Organic Harvest,\" aimed at millennial and Gen Z demographics. Additionally, the increase in disposable incomes and evolving dietary preferences for organic and natural foods enhance market demand. There are prospects for creating new and practical\u00a0organic snack\u00a0products that address specific nutritional requirements, including keto and gluten-free options. Download Free Sample\u00a0Report PDF @ https://straitsresearch.com/report/organic-snacks-market/request-sample Market Dynamics Increasing Health Awareness Among Consumers Drives the Global Market The growing knowledge of the detrimental health impacts of processed snacks has led to a transition towards organic alternatives. The Organic Trade Association (OTA) reported a 14% increase in sales of organic packaged snacks in 2024, as consumers pursued items devoid of artificial tastes and additives. Furthermore, the increasing incidence of lifestyle disorders such as obesity and diabetes has compelled consumers to emphasize better snacking practices. Moreover, prominent entities such as PepsiCo are leveraging this trend by introducing organic variants of their core brands. In 2024, PepsiCo's \"Simply Organic Cheetos\" achieved a 25% market share in the U.S. organic snack sector, propelled by vigorous marketing initiatives highlighting natural ingredients. In addition, school nutrition initiatives in nations such as Germany promote incorporating organic snacks in cafeterias, thereby fostering worldwide market expansion. Expansion into Developing Markets and Collaborations Creates Tremendous Opportunities The global organic snacks market possesses significant untapped potential in emerging economies, where consumer interest in health-conscious lifestyles is increasing. In 2024, India's organic food sector experienced a growth of 19%, with snacks representing 23% of total organic sales. Domestic firms like \"Organic India\" are innovating with culturally pertinent snack alternatives such as organic lentil crisps, catering to local preferences. Story Continues Furthermore, strategic alliances and acquisitions are influencing market dynamics. In April 2025, Mondelez International purchased the company \"Green Eats\" for USD 150 million, including its organic snack offerings into Mondelez's worldwide distribution network. These collaborations allow smaller entities to enhance output while leveraging existing market channels. Technological improvements represent an additional area of possibility. Utilizing blockchain for traceability in the organic supply chain guarantees product authenticity, hence fostering consumer trust. Moreover, sustainable packaging solutions enhance the expansion of organic snacks by attracting ecologically aware consumers. Companies utilizing biodegradable and recyclable packaging exemplified as \"Nature\u2019s Path Organic,\" experience elevated customer retention rates. Investments in these developments promote brand loyalty and correspond with global sustainability objectives. Regional Analysis North America possesses the predominant share of the worldwide organic snacks market due to elevated consumer awareness and extensive acceptance of organic food products. The United States dominates the region, with states such as California and Oregon serving as centers for organic agriculture and innovation. Government programs, such as the USDA Organic Certification Program, have promoted the manufacture and consumption of organic snacks. In June 2024, the U.S. Department of Agriculture allocated USD 50 million for organic research and agriculture, thus indirectly enhancing the organic snacks industry. Moreover, firms such as General Mills and Hain Celestial Group persist in innovating within this industry by introducing new product lines, including gluten-free organic cookies. The Canadian market considerably contributes through expanding retail alliances and consumer education initiatives that promote organic products. Nonetheless, high pricing poses a challenge, restricting accessibility for specific demographics. The Asia-Pacific region is the most rapidly expanding worldwide organic snacks market, driven by increasing disposable incomes and heightened health consciousness. Countries like China, India, and Japan are leading, with urbanization and evolving dietary habits propelling consumption. The Green Food Development Project of the Chinese government seeks to enhance organic agriculture, so indirectly bolstering the organic snacking market. Indian firms like Yoga Bar and Soulfull are gaining popularity with millet-based organic snacks designed for local preferences. Nevertheless, the substantial expense of organic certification and the restricted customer awareness in rural regions persist as impediments. In addition, in Japan, emphasis is placed on technological innovation, with firms such as Calbee Inc. investing in organic product lines and automation to improve production efficiency. The region benefits from trade agreements that facilitate the import of premium organic components, enhancing market growth.

With soaring birth counts and deeper parental engagement in precise nutrient balance, today\u2019s infant food landscape embraces specialized formulations, rapid distribution evolutions, and robust brand commitments to constant product refinements. New Delhi, Jan. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global Infant food market was valued at US$ 76.10 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 126.40 billion 2033, growing at a CAGR of 5.8% during the forecast period 2025-2033. The infant food market currently presents a dynamic landscape shaped by varied consumer preferences, evolving nutritional standards, and diligent oversight from pediatric associations. Providers are exploring new formulations that rely on specialized proteins, fortified cereals, and carefully sourced materials to address concerns around allergenicity and digestibility. Brands in different regions are focusing on distinctive recipes that reflect cultural tastes, while also prioritizing clean-label ingredients and rigorous quality checks. Gerber, owned by Nestl\u00e9, introduced a single-ingredient cereal campaign in 2024 featuring only minimally processed grains. R For Rabbit, based in India, unveiled stage-specific cereal blends derived from sprouted grains, receiving endorsements from five pediatric associations.

Download Free Sample PDF Copy @ https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/infant-food-market Demand analysis of the infant food market reveals that parents increasingly seek products free from synthetic additives, with end users demonstrating heightened attention to formula composition and cereals enriched with functional nutrients. Such demand fosters strong competition among established brands, smaller specialized producers, and digitally-savvy providers marketing directly to consumers. This environment is also shaped by innovations in material sourcing and improved supply chain standards. Plastic packaging has given way to BPA-free alternatives, and there is a measurable leaning toward glass or eco-friendly pouches. However, the market continues to face challenges in ensuring product affordability, maintaining strict safety guidelines, and dealing with recalls prompted by unexpected contamination. Moreover, meeting diverse regional regulations often hinders swift product rollouts. Despite these obstacles, robust interest in specialized formulations, along with an increase in direct-to-consumer channels, helps maintain the market\u2019s momentum.

Nestl\u00e9\u2019s NAN Supreme Pro series, featuring advanced probiotic technologies, is sold in over 35 countries with specialized shelf placements in pediatric-focused pharmacies. Gerber Purees, another Nestl\u00e9-owned brand, continues to expand fruit-and-vegetable blends in regulated markets such as Germany and Japan. Nutrition journals cite Nestl\u00e9\u2019s trademarked hydrolyzed-protein formulas as pioneering solutions for infants with acute digestive complications. Nestl\u00e9 also operates five dedicated research centers, each testing novel ingredients like partially hydrolyzed whey for potential tolerance benefits. In 2024, Nestl\u00e9 reported revenue specifically from infant cereals surpassing its revenues from standard dairy-based offerings, indicating a shift in purchasing preferences in the infant food market. Certain Nestl\u00e9 production sites, including the facility in Konolfingen, Switzerland, focus exclusively on infant nutrition, facilitating rigorous quality control. The brand\u2019s dominance arises from its deep R&D investments, historically rooted presence in numerous pediatric circles, and continued cooperation with distribution chains that prioritize premium infant formulas. Cow & Gate, originating from the United Kingdom and now under the Danone umbrella, specializes in milk-based products, cereals, and follow-on formulas crafted for toddlers transitioning to solid foods. Cow & Gate\u2019s Comfort Range, frequently credited for reducing colic symptoms, carries endorsements from pediatricians in France, Italy, and Spain. Its fruit-and-yogurt pouches are widely recognized in domestic British retail networks, found in more than 600 family-oriented supermarket locations. The company\u2019s Good Night Milk, known for thicker consistency, has gained traction for bedtime feeding routines in many child nutrition forums in the infant food market. Cow & Gate sustains a notable presence in Ireland and Poland, with distribution teams focusing on local pediatric conferences to promote new product variations. Revenue from Cow & Gate infant formulas consistently strengthens Danone\u2019s overall specialized nutrition division, showing stable year-on-year rise in product-specific sales. A dedicated facility in Macroom, Ireland, refines raw dairy inputs for Cow & Gate formulas, ensuring careful oversight of lactose content and protein profiles. The brand\u2019s longstanding reputation for easily digestible formulas and supportive relationships with maternity wards underpins its enduring authority in the infant food market. Analyzing Complex Consumer Behavior Patterns In Modern Contemporary Infant Feeding Choices Parents often prioritize health, convenience, and transparent labeling when purchasing infant food, leading to nuanced buying preferences that differ across demographic groups. Busy urban families may look for single-serve pouches and formulas requiring minimal preparation, while rural consumers sometimes prefer traditional cereals and extra-thick consistencies. A 2024 consumer diary study in Singapore found that brand loyalty shifts quickly for parents of newborns, especially if new product lines feature gentler lacto-fermented grains. At least six major e-commerce platforms, including Mothercare Online and Baby Supermart, report that parents compare ingredient lists before making bulk purchases. A leading parenting forum in Australia documented rigorous discussions about products containing palm oil, prompting some families to adopt alternative vegetable fat-based formulas. At a pediatric expo in Vancouver, five prominent dieticians recommended cereal brands free from maltodextrin, sparking heightened demand in local organic shops. Chinese consumers in tier-one cities actively avoid formulas containing carrageenan, fueling growth for brands that highlight additive-free blending. In the Middle East, specialized date puree variants gain traction in faith-based communities, underscoring cultural influences on infant feeding decisions. Emotional factors also affect consumer behavior in the infant food market. Many parents see feeding routines as a foundation for long-term wellbeing, encouraging strong attachment to products considered wholesome and safe. This trend leads to intensified scrutiny of product labels, with special attention to potential allergens and synthetic fortifications. Ethical concerns about testing, ingredient sourcing, and brand reputation can prompt sudden product boycotts if any negative press emerges. Equally, emotional reassurance from pediatric endorsements often cements consumer loyalty. Such patterns generate fierce competition, as providers strive to distinguish themselves by highlighting purity claims, proven benefits, and transparency in their manufacturing processes. Purchase specific sections of the report directly from the Table of Contents: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/industry-report/toc/infant-food-market Rising Organic Preferences and their Vibrant Appeal For Infant Foods Organic infant food market has captured significant attention among parents seeking wholesome nourishment for their children, prompting both large corporations and small-scale producers to diversify their offerings. Many families choose organic ingredients to minimize synthetic pesticides, hormones, and artificial additives, driving an ongoing wave of specialized cereal blends, fruit purees, and plant-based formulas. Organix, a UK-headquartered brand, launched an entire product line of single-origin cereals in 2024, each grown on dedicated organic farmland. In Austria, the Holle brand maintains a specialized dairy range produced under Demeter biodynamic standards, attracting environmentally aware consumers seeking simpler, minimally processed milk sources. Certain local cooperatives in the United States, including Kalona SuperNatural, have begun supplying smaller infant food makers with grass-fed dairy. The Pediatric Nutrition Council in Norway highlights an organic spelt-and-oat blend from local producers, citing reduced exposure to conventional agricultural chemicals. An emerging brand in Brazil, BemOrg\u00e2nico, uses responsibly grown tropical fruits for infant purees, ensuring traceability from orchard to jar. Several e-commerce grocery portals prominently position organic baby cereals on their top recommendation lists, reflecting robust shopper demand. This popularity stems from a broader perception that organic foods align with holistic child health, encouraging balanced development while potentially lowering the risk of allergic reactions. Many organic labels in the infant food market emphasize short, recognizable ingredient lists, often bolstered by entire genealogies of farm sourcing. Parents find such transparency reassuring, believing that fewer additives may lessen digestive stress and support better nutrient absorption. Furthermore, product labeling that displays established organic certification logos, like USDA Organic or EU Organic, builds trust. Producers focused on this niche benefit from consistent consumer loyalty, often sustained by word-of-mouth endorsements from parent communities. Although differences in taste and texture can exist among organic lines, the promise of minimal intervention resonates strongly, reinforcing the growing preference for organic infant food choices. Investigating Fruit Focused Infant Foods For Heightened Demand and Market Relevance Fruit-based infant food market enjoy enthusiastic acceptance from caregivers who prioritize natural sweetness and vitamins in early diets. Pouches, jars, and freeze-dried snacks featuring fruits such as apples, bananas, and blueberries help introduce infants to new flavors while meeting parental expectations for balanced nutrition. Gerber\u2019s Apple-Banana blend continues to be stocked by child nutrition clinics in major urban centers across the United States, illustrating robust placement for convenient single-serve packages. Ella\u2019s Kitchen, a prominent UK-based brand, maintains a dedicated fruit range with soft textures suitable for weaning stages, which are tested for taste acceptance in multiple pediatric feeding trials. German brand Hipps recently introduced a peach-and-apricot puree line that underwent sensor analysis to ensure minimal sugar content derived only from fruit sources. Beech-Nut\u2019s fruit-infused cereals remain popular in Canada, containing finely milled apple powder verified by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency for purity. A local Indian venture, TummyFriendly, crafts freeze-dried mango snacks for infants transitioning to solids, winning mentions from pediatric circles in Mumbai. Heinz, while well-known for savory offerings, added a tropical fruit medley in Latin American markets that includes papaya and guava to expand feeding variety. Such demand stems from a belief that fruit blends can supplement essential vitamins without the need for artificial enhancers. Parents often favor fruit-based products for introducing solid textures, as these items typically boast recognizable ingredient lists and are gentle on developing palates. Additionally, the natural sweetness of fruit can serve as an appealing gateway to broader culinary exploration, soothing infant acceptance during the transition from milk-only diets. Brands that thoroughly test their fruit selections for pesticide residues and heavy metals, as required by various national agencies, earn confidence from health professionals and caregivers alike. This alignment of convenience, authenticity, and nutritional value ensures the continued prominence of fruit-focused offerings within the infant food market.

South African AWB in 2010 and Elon Musk during a speech after Trump\u2019s inauguration on 20 January 2025. Photograph: AFP via Getty Images, Reuters When Elon Musk\u2019s arm shot out in a stiff arm salute at Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural celebrations, startled viewers mostly drew the obvious comparison. But in the fired-up debate about Musk\u2019s intent that followed, as the world\u2019s richest man insisted he wasn\u2019t trying to be a Nazi, speculation inevitably focused on whether his roots in apartheid-era South Africa offered an insight. In recent months Musk\u2019s promotion of far-right conspiracy theories has grown, from a deepening hostility to democratic institutions to the recent endorsement of Germany\u2019s far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD). He has taken an unhealthy interest in genetics while backing claims of a looming \u201c white genocide \u201d in his South African homeland and endorsing posts promoting the racist \u201cgreat replacement\u201d conspiracy theory. Increasingly, his language and tone have come to echo the old South Africa. He is not alone. Musk is part of the \u201cPayPal mafia\u201d of libertarian billionaires with roots in South Africa under white rule now hugely influential in the US tech industry and politics. They include Peter Thiel, the German-born billionaire venture capitalist and PayPal cofounder, who was educated in a southern African city in the 1970s where Hitler was still openly venerated. Thiel, a major donor to Trump\u2019s campaign, has been critical of welfare programs and women being permitted to vote as undermining capitalism. A 2021 biography of Thiel, called The Contrarian, alleged that as a student at Stanford he defended apartheid as \u201ceconomically sound\u201d. David Sacks, formerly PayPal\u2019s chief operating officer and now a leading fundraiser for Trump, was born in Cape Town and grew up within the South African diaspora after his family moved to the US when he was young. A fourth member of the mafia, Roelof Botha, the grandson of the apartheid regime\u2019s last foreign minister, Pik Botha, and former PayPal CFO, has kept a lower political profile but remains close to Musk. Related: \u2018Reactionary nihilism\u2019: how a rightwing movement strives to end US democracy Among them, Musk stands out for his ownership of X, which is increasingly a platform for far-right views, and his proximity to Trump, who has nominated Musk to head a \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d to slash and burn its way through the federal bureaucracy. Some draw a straight line between Musk\u2019s formative years atop a complex system of racial hierarchy as a white male, in a country increasingly at war with itself as the South African government became ever more repressive as resistance to apartheid grew, and the man we see at Trump\u2019s side today. Story Continues The week before the inauguration, Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s former adviser, described white South Africans as the \u201cmost racist people on earth\u201d, questioned their involvement in US politics and said Musk was a malign influence who should go back to the country of his birth. Others are sceptical that Musk\u2019s increasingly extreme views can be tracked back to his upbringing in Pretoria. The acclaimed South African writer Jonny Steinberg recently called attempts to explain Musk through his childhood under apartheid \u201ca bad idea\u201d that resulted in \u201cfacile\u201d conclusions. But for those looking to join dots, there is fodder from Musk\u2019s early life with a neo-Nazi grandfather who moved from Canada to South Africa because he liked the idea of apartheid through his high school education in a system infused with the ideology of white supremacy. Musk\u2019s formative years in the 1980s came amid a cauldron of rebellion in the Black townships which drew a state of emergency and a bloody crackdown by the state. Some whites fled the country. Others marched with the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement against any weakening of apartheid. The South Africa into which Musk was born in 1971, and to which Thiel moved as a child from Germany, was led by a prime minister, John Vorster, who had been a general in a fascist militia three decades earlier that allied itself with Hitler. The Ossewabrandwag (OB) was founded shortly before the second world war. It opposed South Africa entering the war as an ally of Britain and plotted with German military intelligence to assassinate the prime minster, Jan Smuts, as a prelude to an armed uprising in support of Hitler. Vorster made no secret of his sympathy for Nazi, or National Socialist, ideology which he compared to the Afrikaner political philosophy of Christian nationalism. \u201cWe stand for Christian nationalism which is an ally of National Socialism,\u201d he said in 1942. \u201cYou can call this anti-democratic principle dictatorship if you wish. In Italy it is called \u2018Fascism\u2019, in Germany \u2018German National Socialism\u2019 and in South Africa \u2018Christian nationalism\u2019.\u201d Smuts\u2019s government took a dim view of that and a few weeks later interned Vorster as a Nazi sympathiser. Related: KKK distributes flyers in Kentucky telling immigrants to \u2018leave now\u2019 At the end of the war, the OB was absorbed into the National party, which then won the 1948 election, in which Black South Africans had no vote, on a commitment to impose apartheid. In 1961, Vorster joined the government as minister of justice and five years later became prime minister. Nazism may have been defeated in Europe but Christian nationalism was alive and kicking in South Africa under Vorster, with its own brand of racial classification and stratification justified by the need to keep the \u201c swart gevaar \u201d, or black danger, at bay. In schools, Christian nationalist education sought to forge a South African identity around a singular version of the country\u2019s history. Musk and Thiel were taught that the Afrikaner, mostly the descendants of Dutch colonisers, was the real victim of South Africa\u2019s strife whether at the hands of grasping British imperialists or treacherous Zulu chiefs. The truth is we didn\u2019t see Black people quite as equals. We didn\u2019t think about it Bea Roberts, who grew up in an apartheid-supporting family but came to oppose the system and later worked for the Institute for a Democratic South Africa, remembers a heavy emphasis on Afrikaners as victims pursuing apartheid in order to protect their culture and even their very existence. \u201cIt was a strange mix of \u2018we got fucked up by the British in the [second Boer] war, and our women and children died in thousands in the concentration camps\u2019 so we are going to rebuild our nation and make sure that that we are invincible. And we\u2019ll do that by extreme means,\u201d she said. Schooling, like much else, was segregated by race for most of the apartheid era and, on paper at least, white pupils across South Africa were subject to the same Christian nationalist education. But white society was itself divided and the historical narrative embraced in Afrikaans-speaking schools could often became the basis for an implicit rejection of apartheid philosophy in English-speaking ones. Musk attended a Johannesburg high school and then the Pretoria boys high school, an institution whose other alumni include students who went on to become leading anti-apartheid activists such as Edwin Cameron, a South African supreme court justice after the collapse of white rule, and Peter Hain, who moved to Britain, where he became a leading campaigner against apartheid and then a Labour government minister. Phillip Van Niekerk, former editor of the leading anti-apartheid Mail and Guardian newspaper in Johannesburg, had Afrikaner parents but attended an English-speaking school. He recalled that the official version of history did little to engender support for the apartheid system among a lot of English speakers even if they benefited from it and did little to challenge it. \u201cWe hated the National party government. Even our teachers were kind of hostile. It was seen almost like an imposition. Yet you imbibe things through the culture. The truth is we didn\u2019t see Black people quite as equals. We didn\u2019t think about it,\u201d he said. Thiel got all that and more at schools in South Africa and its de facto colony, South West Africa, which became independent as Namibia in 1990. South West Africa had been a German colony until the end of the first world war and Thiel lived for a time in the city of Swakopmund, where he attended a German-language school while his father worked at a nearby uranium mine. At that time, Swakopmund was notorious for its continued glorification of Nazism, including celebrating Hitler\u2019s birthday. In 1976, the New York Times reported that some people in the town continued to greet each other with \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d and to give the Nazi salute. Van Niekerk visited Swakopmund during South African rule. \u201cI was there in the 1980s and you could walk into a curio shop and buy mugs with Nazi swastikas on them. If you\u2019re German and you\u2019re in Swakopmund in the 1970s, which is when Thiel was there, you\u2019re part of that community,\u201d he said. Thiel, who moved to the US when he was 10, has described his schooling in Swakopmund as instilling a dislike of regimentation that steered him towards libertarianism. Thiel\u2019s father worked at a uranium mine in R\u00f6ssing where, as in the gold and coalmines of the Reef around Johannesburg, Black laborers were paid just enough to survive, living conditions were dire and the work dangerous. White managers, on the other hand, lived a lifestyle of neo-colonial luxury with servants at the ready. Musk\u2019s father, Errol, was also in the mining business among other interests. He once boasted that his stake in Zambian emerald mines made him \u201cso much money we couldn\u2019t even close our safe\u201d. Musk\u2019s mother, Maye, has said the family owned two homes, a plane, a yacht and a handful of luxury cars. Errol Musk has said that he opposed apartheid and joined the Progressive Federal party but then left because he didn\u2019t like its demand for one person, one vote, and instead favored a more gradual reform with separate parliaments for different races. That was the liberal position inside the Musk family. Musk\u2019s maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, moved from Canada to South Africa in 1950 because he liked the newly elected apartheid government. In the 1930s, Haldeman was the Canadian leader of a fringe political movement originating in the US, Technocracy Incorporated, that advocated abolishing democracy in favor of government by elite technicians but which took on overtones of fascism with its uniforms and salutes. The Canadian government banned Technocracy Incorporated during the second world war as a threat to the country\u2019s security in part for its opposition to fighting Hitler. Haldeman was charged with publishing documents opposing the war and sent to prison for two months. After the war, Haldeman led a separate political party that among other things promoted the antisemitic forgery the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. When that went nowhere, he moved to South Africa because he said he liked the core National party philosophy of Christian nationalism that Vorster likened to Nazism. Errol Musk described Maye\u2019s parents as so extreme he stopped visiting them. We white South Africans, by the very nature of our privileges and our place in the racial hierarchy, grew up believing we were the master race \u201cThey were very fanatical in favor of apartheid,\u201d he told Podcast and Chill . \u201cHer parents came to South Africa from Canada because they sympathised with the Afrikaner government. They used to support Hitler and all that sort of stuff.\u201d Haldeman was killed in a plane crash when Elon was three years old but the boy remained close to his grandmother and mother. He is estranged from his father, whom Maye has described as abusive of her and their children. Errol Musk once claimed to have shot and killed three people who broke into his house. Musk has described his father as a \u201cterrible human being\u201d. \u201cAlmost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done,\u201d he told Rolling Stone without elaborating in 2017. What is indisputable is that Musk and Thiel grew up amid incredible privilege where the racial hierarchy was clear. Those who claimed to reject apartheid sought to explain this privilege not as the result of systemic racial oppression but the natural order of things thanks to their own abilities. That in turn led some to regard all forms government as oppressive and true liberty as an individual battle for survival. The biography of Thiel said he held a view common among apartheid\u2019s supporters at the time that Black South Africans were better off than Africans in other parts of the continent even if they were systematically denied their rights. Thiel has denied ever having supported apartheid. Van Niekerk said that opposition to apartheid did not necessarily mean rejection of white supremacy or privilege, a point made in a 1968 British television documentary the year before Thiel was born. The commentary observed that the English-speaking mining barons and other industrialists in Johannesburg usually claimed to be \u201chostile to apartheid, call themselves liberal\u201d but did little to oppose the system while profiting from it. Helen Suzman, at the time a member of the South African parliament who was often a lone voice in opposition to apartheid, was critical of these powerful industrialists and businessmen, saying \u201cpeople who do nothing are responsible\u201d. She accused them of hiding behind apartheid to exploit Black workers. \u201cI see no reason why the industrialists should not improve the living conditions of their workers,\u201d she said. In the documentary, Stanley Cohen, the managing director of the OK Bazaars supermarket chain owned by his family, was asked why he only employed whites behind the counter and no South Africans of other races even though many of the customers were Black. Cohen acknowledged that it was not a legal requirement, but did it to indulge the racist prejudices of white customers. \u201cThere is no reason why they [Black people] can\u2019t work behind the counters. There\u2019s no law against it. But there is this natural prejudice in this country which you can\u2019t legislate for or against,\u201d he said. A decade later, power was shifting. The uprising that began in Soweto in 1976 had become a full-blown national crisis for the apartheid system by the 1980s. A low-level civil war was under way. In response, the state grew even more violent and repressive. White paranoia was fed by the creep of independent Black African states under Marxist-leaning governments ever closer to South Africa\u2019s borders, with Angola and Mozambique in the 1970s followed by Zimbabwe in 1980. Talk of white genocide emerged, a conspiracy theory that has taken on new life in recent times with the killings of white farmers in South Africa and Zimbabwe. Support surged for the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB), or Afrikaner Resistance Movement, founded in the early 1970s to oppose any relaxation of apartheid. The AWB, founded by Eugene Terre\u2019Blanche, an imposing and flamboyant figure given to riding around on a horse from which he occasionally fell off, made no secret of its model with a badge strikingly similar to a swastika in design and colors. It\u2019s supporters were also fond of the stiff-armed Hitler salute as they paraded on the streets of Pretoria. At its peak, the AWB appeared to have the support of more than 10% of white South Africans. Roberts said life for privileged whites in particular was \u201cdefinitely a bubble, and one filled with self-belief\u201d. But she said that it became increasingly difficult to ignore reality. \u201cI think Musk in Pretoria in the 1980s must have had a sense of what Black people were experiencing and why they were angry. I grew up fairly conservative but I was able to change my views. I think you have to be fairly rigid in the 80s to still cling on to the belief that the apartheid system was fine and correct and in everybody\u2019s best interest,\u201d she said. Musk left South Africa in 1988 in the midst of this ferment, two years before FW de Klerk carved out a path to freedom by releasing Nelson Mandela. Had he stayed, Musk faced being conscripted into the military for two years, an obligatory service for white men, that could well have meant fighting in the \u201cborder war\u201d in Angola and Namibia or being sent to put down Black protests in the townships. Instead, Musk took Canadian citizenship through his mother and moved to Ontario. Van Niekerk said that, whether he wants to admit it or not, Musk also took a part of South Africa with him. \u201cWe all [white South Africans], by the very nature of our privileges and our place in the racial hierarchy, grew up believing we were the master race, even if we didn\u2019t actively think about it,\u201d he said.

Consumer Trust in Convenience Foods to Support Growth, Rising Predilection of \"Free-from\" Foods by Consumers Gluten Free Food Market Gluten Free Food Market Dublin, Jan. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Gluten Free Food Market Global Forecast Report by Product Type, Form, Source, Distribution Channel, Countries and Company Analysis 2025-2033\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The Global Gluten Free Food Market will reach US$ 14.12 billion by 2033, up from US$ 6.64 billion in 2024, with a CAGR of 8.75% between 2025 and 2033. The growing consumer knowledge of gluten intolerance, growing health consciousness, the need for allergy-free products, the expansion of product availability, clean eating and plant-based diets, and other health trends are driving the growth of the gluten-free food market. Growing Increasing Consumer Trust in Convenience Foods to Support Growth Due to their ease of preparation and consumption, consumers' growing desire for convenient and ready-to-eat meals has had a beneficial effect on product demand. They look for prepared foods that are natural, abundant in nutrients, and meet their dietary needs without sacrificing flavor or taste. The ability of this meal to support customers in maintaining their general health in the face of a fast-paced lifestyle is the most crucial component of their dependability on it. Because these ready-to-cook and eat meals save time and provide the necessary nourishment, the number of working women has increased. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women's labor force participation peaked in June 2023 at 77.8%. Furthermore, convenience food makers have been motivated to create high-end convenience foods including deli-style snacks and ready meals inspired by international cuisines due to the growing trend of health on-the-go, particularly among millennials. This element shows that consumers are open to trying different meals, which presents a lot of room for market expansion in the years to come. Growing Predilection of \"Free-from\" Foods by Consumers There is a noticeable surge in demand for the \"free-from\" food category worldwide. In recent years, the clean-label and \"free-from\" categories have gone from being niche to becoming popular due to consumers' increased awareness of healthy eating. Consumers turn toward food that helps them manage and maintain their overall health. They look for substitute food and drink recipes that fit their diets and help them avoid food sensitivities. By launching new items to meet the growing demand, manufacturers are also adjusting to the changing preferences of their customers. For example, Base Culture, one of the top frozen bread companies in the United States, debuted their newest gluten-free and shelf-stable breads under the Simply brand in February 2024. Tapioca, flax, hemp, chickpea, and coconut flour are among the clean flours used to make this basic bread line. Additionally, the product is now offered in a variety of flavors, including basic sandwich, super seed, and hint of honey. Additionally, the \"free-from\" food category can be improved thanks to expanding research and technical advancements, which is anticipated to support market expansion in the years to come. Expansion of Product Variety The market for gluten-free foods has expanded significantly in terms of product variety, moving beyond conventional mainstays like bread and pasta. Nowadays, a variety of gluten-free baked goods, snacks, drinks, and convenience meals are available to consumers, making it simpler to follow a gluten-free diet without sacrificing convenience or flavor. The market offers a wider range of products, from ready-to-eat meals and gluten-free beverages like smoothies and beers to gluten-free crackers, cookies, and chips. This product variety serves both health-conscious consumers looking for other diets and those with gluten sensitivity. Innovations in gluten-free ingredients and production methods have fueled the growth by enhancing taste and texture and drawing in customers outside of the dietary restriction market. Gluten Free Food Market Overview by Regions Due to increased knowledge of celiac illness and gluten intolerance, the market for gluten-free foods is largest in North America and Europe. Growing health consciousness is also driving growth in Asia-Pacific, and the demand for gluten-free products is growing in Latin America and the Middle East.

Each serving of two cookies has 60 calories, 2 g of net carbohydrates, 7 g of fiber, and no sugar. China Gluten Free Food Market The market for gluten-free foods in China is expanding quickly due to growing demand for alternative dietary options and health consciousness.

With a large assortment of snacks, baked goods, drinks, and prepared meals now offered in both mainstream grocery stores and health food stores, the availability of gluten-free products has expanded.
