[{"text": "Is Now The Time To Put Green Brick Partners (NYSE:GRBK) On Your Watchlist? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 5:06 PM 3 min read In This Article: GRBK -3.41% GRBK-PA -0.33% For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away. If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Green Brick Partners ( NYSE:GRBK ). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. See our latest analysis for Green Brick Partners How Fast Is Green Brick Partners Growing?

Partner to Develop Kroger-Anchored Shopping Center in North Fort Worth Business Wire Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 9:35 PM 2 min read FORT WORTH, Texas, January 17, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Davidson Bogel Real Estate (\"DB2RE\") is pleased to announce a new retail shopping center anchored by Kroger (NYSE: KR) in northwest Fort Worth. Houston-based real estate developer, SDI Realty, partnered with Nexus Real Estate Co. to purchase the land. The property is located in northwest Fort Worth, and is surrounded by several new single-family communities. The land was owned by Miami-based Lennar Homes (NYSE: LEN), where they are currently developing a single-family community called Rancho Canyon. Ryan Turner, David Davidson Jr., Edward Bogel and Collins Meier represented the purchaser, a partnership between SDI & Nexus, in acquiring a portion of the land for the grocery-anchored shopping center. \"We are excited to be able to offer our residents in Rancho Canyon a quality grocery component for their daily needs. We had initially planned for this portion of the project to be residential, but we were approached by Davidson Bogel and began exploring options to bring additional retail amenities to our residents,\" said Greg Urech, President of Land \u2013 DFW for Lennar. \"Working alongside SDI and Davidson Bogel to bring Kroger to our Rancho Canyon community has been an exciting journey. It's about more than just adding a store\u2014it's about enriching the lives of those who call this community home.\" DB2RE also assisted the partnership in acquiring an acre from Shaffer Construction, who owned about four acres on the corner of Rancho Canyon Road & Sendera Ranch Road that DB2RE had sold them in 2022. Shaffer plans to develop a 7-Eleven gas station on the corner outside of the future Kroger-anchored Shopping Center. The site will allow Kroger to serve the needs of many new surrounding residents, as northwest Fort Worth continues to be a hotbed of residential development activity. In addition to Lennar\u2019s Rancho Canyon, Centurion American is developing Alpha Ranch, a 1,825 acre master-planned community that will be home to almost 4,000 lots. Greenbrick (NYSE: GRBK) also partnered with Taylor Morrison (NYSE: TMHC) to develop Madero, a 2,500 home community, immediately adjacent to the new Kroger site.

(NYSE:GRBK) Given Its Attractive Financial Prospects? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Thu, Jan 9, 2025, 2:29 PM 3 min read In This Article: GRBK -3.41% GRBK-PA -0.33% It is hard to get excited after looking at Green Brick Partners' (NYSE:GRBK) recent performance, when its stock has declined 28% over the past three months. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company\u2019s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. In this article, we decided to focus on Green Brick Partners' ROE. Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Green Brick Partners How Is ROE Calculated? The formula for ROE is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Green Brick Partners is: 24% = US$382m \u00f7 US$1.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024). The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.24 in profit. Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth? We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. A Side By Side comparison of Green Brick Partners' Earnings Growth And 24% ROE Firstly, we acknowledge that Green Brick Partners has a significantly high ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 16% the company's ROE is quite impressive. So, the substantial 31% net income growth seen by Green Brick Partners over the past five years isn't overly surprising. As a next step, we compared Green Brick Partners' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 19%. NYSE:GRBK Past Earnings Growth January 9th 2025 The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in.

Story Continues Is Green Brick Partners Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?

These factors are projected to inflate material expenses and keep prices of real estate high. Until macroeconomic conditions improve, sales activity is likely to remain subdued in the near future. However, healthy demand for a number of real estate property types and a slowdown in the pace of new deliveries are likely to provide the industry some support, placing players like Howard Hughes Holdings Inc. , Green Brick Partners, Inc. and LGI Homes, Inc. well for growth. About the Industry The Zacks Real Estate \u2013 Development industry comprises companies that are mainly engaged in owning, developing and managing a variety of real estate properties, including commercial, residential and mixed-use parcels. While some developers undertake construction on their land holdings to eventually sell the properties to homebuilders, retaining the same for conducting operations is also a common practice. Some industry participants actively undertake strategic activities, such as infrastructure improvement, along with land planning and development to boost economic development, attract quality job creators and diversify the regions in which the firms operate. These firms provide real estate leasing, stewardship, underwriting, planning and entitlement services. Real estate development companies are chiefly classified as financial ones, not construction firms. What's Shaping the Future of the Real Estate Development Industry? Geopolitical Unrest to Affect the Industry: The industry\u2019s performance is likely to bear the brunt of geopolitical unrest. The consideration of new tariffs on imports from mainland China or other countries could have a substantial effect on trade policy. Moreover, economists expect tariffs and policies by the newly elected president to be inflationary. Although the Federal Reserve has reduced interest rates in recent times, it sees fewer cuts next year due to an expected high inflation. Amid such an environment, clients are likely to adopt a cautious approach. As a result, investors\u2019 desire for greater price discovery will cause a delay in the closing timeline for transactions. Story Continues Macroeconomic Uncertainty & Supply-Chain Woes Linger: Although investor sentiment has improved to a certain extent, as they try to make the best out of the present market conditions, a cautious stance among many continues. Over the past few years, the wars have fueled regional instability, significantly impacting energy and food security. This situation has escalated supply-chain disruption and led to increased inflation rates and other macroeconomic challenges worldwide. Several capital sources are tightening their underwriting practices, reducing credit availability. As a result, the volume of commercial real estate transactions remains on the lower side. Per the CBRE report, U.S. commercial real estate investment volume decreased 2% year over year in the third quarter of 2024 to $90 billion. Moreover, macroeconomic uncertainty has repeatedly disrupted the supply chain at various stages in recent years. Until macroeconomic conditions improve, sales activity is likely to remain subdued in the forthcoming period. Demand Revival for Certain Asset Classes and Constrained Supply Help Industry Fundamentals: Demand for certain real estate categories such as retail, industrial and logistics, and office are witnessing healthy growth. The post-pandemic resurgence in consumers' preference for in-person shopping is propelling retail real estate demand in high-traffic corridors as retailers eye expansion to satisfy this demand. Meanwhile, the e-commerce boom and supply-chain strategy transformations provided an impetus to the industrial and logistics real estate space. Moreover, the office REITs companies are seeing an increasing number of tenants returning to offices or announcing plans to come back. This is likely to support office real estate market fundamentals. However, the elevated interest rate environment in the past quarters has not only pushed up the cost of raw materials but also slowed down the pace of new construction deliveries. Particularly, the residential market is grappling with a substantial shortage of new homes, stemming from more than a decade of under-building compared with population growth. The retail real estate market is also going through supply shortages, which is helping the industry fundamentals. Hence, the rebound in demand for certain real estate categories and supply shortage are likely to play a role in maintaining favorable industry fundamentals. Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak Prospects The Zacks Real Estate Development industry is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #147, which places it in the bottom 41% of 249 Zacks industries. The group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dim near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one. The industry\u2019s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group\u2019s earnings growth potential. For 2024, the industry\u2019s earnings estimates have decreased by 4.4% since January 2024. However, before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let\u2019s take a look at the industry\u2019s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.

Article: ^GSPC -0.76% The Zacks Real Estate \u2013 Development industry constituents are likely to face challenges due to the geopolitical unrest, macroeconomic uncertainty and supply-chain disruption. These factors are projected to inflate material expenses and keep prices of real estate high. Until macroeconomic conditions improve, sales activity is likely to remain subdued in the near future. However, healthy demand for a number of real estate property types and a slowdown in the pace of new deliveries are likely to provide the industry some support, placing players like Howard Hughes Holdings Inc. HHH, Green Brick Partners, Inc. GRBK and LGI Homes, Inc. LGIH well for growth. About the Industry The Zacks Real Estate \u2013 Development industry comprises companies that are mainly engaged in owning, developing and managing a variety of real estate properties, including commercial, residential and mixed-use parcels. While some developers undertake construction on their land holdings to eventually sell the properties to homebuilders, retaining the same for conducting operations is also a common practice. Some industry participants actively undertake strategic activities, such as infrastructure improvement, along with land planning and development to boost economic development, attract quality job creators and diversify the regions in which the firms operate. These firms provide real estate leasing, stewardship, underwriting, planning and entitlement services. Real estate development companies are chiefly classified as financial ones, not construction firms. What's Shaping the Future of the Real Estate Development Industry? Geopolitical Unrest to Affect the Industry: The industry\u2019s performance is likely to bear the brunt of geopolitical unrest. The consideration of new tariffs on imports from mainland China or other countries could have a substantial effect on trade policy. Moreover, economists expect tariffs and policies by the newly elected president to be inflationary. Although the Federal Reserve has reduced interest rates in recent times, it sees fewer cuts next year due to an expected high inflation. Amid such an environment, clients are likely to adopt a cautious approach. As a result, investors\u2019 desire for greater price discovery will cause a delay in the closing timeline for transactions. Macroeconomic Uncertainty & Supply-Chain Woes Linger: Although investor sentiment has improved to a certain extent, as they try to make the best out of the present market conditions, a cautious stance among many continues. Over the past few years, the wars have fueled regional instability, significantly impacting energy and food security. This situation has escalated supply-chain disruption and led to increased inflation rates and other macroeconomic challenges worldwide. Several capital sources are tightening their underwriting practices, reducing credit availability. As a result, the volume of commercial real estate transactions remains on the lower side. Per the CBRE report, U.S. commercial real estate investment volume decreased 2% year over year in the third quarter of 2024 to $90 billion. Moreover, macroeconomic uncertainty has repeatedly disrupted the supply chain at various stages in recent years. Until macroeconomic conditions improve, sales activity is likely to remain subdued in the forthcoming period. Story Continues Demand Revival for Certain Asset Classes and Constrained Supply Help Industry Fundamentals: Demand for certain real estate categories such as retail, industrial and logistics, and office are witnessing healthy growth. The post-pandemic resurgence in consumers' preference for in-person shopping is propelling retail real estate demand in high-traffic corridors as retailers eye expansion to satisfy this demand. Meanwhile, the e-commerce boom and supply-chain strategy transformations provided an impetus to the industrial and logistics real estate space. Moreover, the office REITs companies are seeing an increasing number of tenants returning to offices or announcing plans to come back. This is likely to support office real estate market fundamentals. However, the elevated interest rate environment in the past quarters has not only pushed up the cost of raw materials but also slowed down the pace of new construction deliveries. Particularly, the residential market is grappling with a substantial shortage of new homes, stemming from more than a decade of under-building compared with population growth. The retail real estate market is also going through supply shortages, which is helping the industry fundamentals. Hence, the rebound in demand for certain real estate categories and supply shortage are likely to play a role in maintaining favorable industry fundamentals. Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak Prospects The Zacks Real Estate Development industry is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #147, which places it in the bottom 41% of 249 Zacks industries. The group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dim near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one. The industry\u2019s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group\u2019s earnings growth potential. For 2024, the industry\u2019s earnings estimates have decreased by 4.4% since January 2024. However, before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let\u2019s take a look at the industry\u2019s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.

The industry has declined 14.1% during this period against the S&P 500 composite\u2019s growth of 27.3%. The broader Finance sector has increased 18.3%. One-Year Price Performance Industry's Current Valuation On the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing real estate development companies, we see that the industry is currently trading at 6.24X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 22.66X. The industry is also trading below the Finance sector\u2019s forward 12-month P/E of 17.01X. This is shown in the chart below. Forward 12-Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 29.99X and as low as 3.77X, with a median of 6.98X. 3 Real Estate Development Stocks to Consider Howard Hughes Holdings, Inc.: This Woodlands, TX-based company is engaged in the ownership, management and development of commercial, residential and mixed-use real estate throughout the United States.

the Top Stock for Billionaire David Einhorn? Neha Gupta Thu, Dec 19, 2024, 12:04 PM 6 min read In This Article: GLRE -1.41% We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire David Einhorn . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Green Brick Partners, Inc. (NYSE:GRBK) stands against the other best stocks to buy according to Billionaire David Einhorn. The markets are broken and getting worse. That\u2019s the stance held by billionaire investor David Einhorn, who insists we are in a secular destruction of the professional asset management community. The sentiments come against one of the longest bull runs that have resulted in valuations in the equity markets getting out of hand. While the S&P 500 is at record highs after a 30% plus gain year to date, Einhorn views the markets as fundamentally broken. Passive investors with no opinion or concern about value have been the main drivers pushing the market higher while shunning underlying fundamentals. According to Einhorn, passive investors increasingly buy into market indexes by default, propping growth stocks at the expense of value stocks.

Likewise, the billionaire hedge fund manager laments that value investors are increasingly marginalized. \u201cAnd so effectively instead of the valuation becoming the signal, the valuation people were just noise and everybody else is sort of the signal. And this is why I think we have a structurally dysfunctional market, a bit of a broken market, and essentially a perpetual erosion of value as a strategy, as you would,\u201d Einhorn said in an interview with CNBC. The sentiments underline the growing concerns that value stocks are becoming increasingly cheaper and cheaper relative to their underlying fundamentals. That\u2019s in part because investors are turning their attention to indexes and growth stocks, resulting in overstretched valuations. Increased focus on growth stocks at the expense of value stocks has resulted in one of the most expensive stock markets in decades. Amid the premium valuations, David Einhorn insists there is still some value to unlock by focusing on value stocks trading at discounted valuations. By focusing on value investments, Einhorn has generated strong long-term returns through Greenlight Capital , the hedge fund he founded in 1996 with $900,000 from family and friends. Likewise, Greenlight Capital rose to prominence at the height of the financial crisis, as Einhorn sensed a window of opportunity to generate some returns by shorting the stock of Lehman brothers. Similarly, it was on the news in 2002 as it shorted Allied Capital, a transaction that was validated in 2002 by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Story Continues Since 1996, Greenlight Capital has averaged 13.1% in annual returns compared to 9.5% gains for the S&P 500. The outperformance comes from Einhorn emphasizing the balancing of long- and short-term exposure in investments. Likewise, he advocates monitoring industry risks and obtaining insurance against foreseeable macro threats. Additionally, stock picking has always been essential as one of Einhorn's key investment strategies of integrating considerable picture awareness into successful portfolio management strategies. Diversification as one of the ways of spreading risks is also Einhorn\u2019s key investment strategies. \u201cHaving my eyes open to the big picture doesn\u2019t mean abandoning stock picking, but it does mean managing the long-short exposure ratio more actively, worrying about what may be brewing in certain industries, and, when appropriate, buying some just-in-case insurance for foreseeable macro risks even if they are hard to time,\u201d Einhorn said.

Partners, Inc. (NYSE:GRBK)? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Thu, Nov 21, 2024, 3:47 PM 3 min read In This Article: GRBK -3.41% GRBK-PA -0.33% While Green Brick Partners, Inc. ( NYSE:GRBK ) might not have the largest market cap around , it saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$83.77 and falling to the lows of US$68.02. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Green Brick Partners' current trading price of US$68.68 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Green Brick Partners\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Green Brick Partners What Is Green Brick Partners Worth? Great news for investors \u2013 Green Brick Partners is still trading at a fairly cheap price according to our price multiple model, where we compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, we\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock\u2019s cash flows. we find that Green Brick Partners\u2019s ratio of 8.78x is below its peer average of 11.18x, which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the Consumer Durables industry. However, given that Green Brick Partners\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility. What does the future of Green Brick Partners look like? NYSE:GRBK Earnings and Revenue Growth November 21st 2024 Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Green Brick Partners' earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value. What This Means For You Are you a shareholder? Since GRBK is currently trading below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic profit outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current price multiple. Story Continues Are you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on GRBK for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future profit outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy GRBK. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.

Shouldn't Be Too Comfortable With Green Brick Partners' (NYSE:GRBK) Earnings editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 3:12 PM 3 min read In This Article: GRBK -3.41% GRBK-PA -0.33% Despite announcing strong earnings, Green Brick Partners, Inc.'s ( NYSE:GRBK ) stock was sluggish. We think that the market might be paying attention to some underlying factors that they find to be concerning. View our latest analysis for Green Brick Partners NYSE:GRBK Earnings and Revenue History November 7th 2024 A Closer Look At Green Brick Partners' Earnings In high finance, the key ratio used to measure how well a company converts reported profits into free cash flow (FCF) is the accrual ratio (from cashflow). To get the accrual ratio we first subtract FCF from profit for a period, and then divide that number by the average operating assets for the period. The ratio shows us how much a company's profit exceeds its FCF. That means a negative accrual ratio is a good thing, because it shows that the company is bringing in more free cash flow than its profit would suggest. While it's not a problem to have a positive accrual ratio, indicating a certain level of non-cash profits, a high accrual ratio is arguably a bad thing, because it indicates paper profits are not matched by cash flow. That's because some academic studies have suggested that high accruals ratios tend to lead to lower profit or less profit growth. Over the twelve months to September 2024, Green Brick Partners recorded an accrual ratio of 0.23. We can therefore deduce that its free cash flow fell well short of covering its statutory profit. Even though it reported a profit of US$347.9m, a look at free cash flow indicates it actually burnt through US$29m in the last year. We saw that FCF was US$287m a year ago though, so Green Brick Partners has at least been able to generate positive FCF in the past. The good news for shareholders is that Green Brick Partners' accrual ratio was much better last year, so this year's poor reading might simply be a case of a short term mismatch between profit and FCF. As a result, some shareholders may be looking for stronger cash conversion in the current year. That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates. Our Take On Green Brick Partners' Profit Performance Green Brick Partners' accrual ratio for the last twelve months signifies cash conversion is less than ideal, which is a negative when it comes to our view of its earnings. Therefore, it seems possible to us that Green Brick Partners' true underlying earnings power is actually less than its statutory profit. But the good news is that its EPS growth over the last three years has been very impressive. The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider. If you want to do dive deeper into Green Brick Partners, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.
