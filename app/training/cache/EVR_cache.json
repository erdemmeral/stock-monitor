[{"text": "Evercore (EVR) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy? Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 6:00 PM 4 min read In This Article: EVR -2.79% Evercore (EVR) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price. The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This investment bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.90 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +43.6%. Revenues are expected to be $869.15 million, up 10.8% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.07% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change. Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Story Continues Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Evercore? For Evercore, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%. On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3. So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Evercore will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue? While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Evercore would post earnings of $1.95 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.04, delivering a surprise of +4.62%. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times. Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Evercore doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

Banks To Work For In 2025 Jeff Schmitt Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 7:45 PM 20 min read In This Article: MC -0.91% EVR -2.79% PJT +0.22% What do people associate with investment banking? Jamie Dimon. Vampire Squid. Bloomberg. Booms-and-busts. Wall Street and Square Mile. Complicated algorithms and glorious slide decks. Seven-figure paychecks too. Here, the dream is to \u2018Get rich and get out\u2019 \u2013 because you\u2019re only as good as your last deal. To most, banking is a burnout job \u2013 no break, no balance, no life. Fierce competition, crushing workloads, and never-ending deadlines \u2013 an unrelenting pressure to be a Master of the Universe. In the bigger picture, is that any way to live? SIXTH TIME IS THE CHARM That\u2019s exactly the question being asked in banking: wealth or health? You\u2019ll find some of the answers in the Vault Banking 25 . An annual survey conducted since 2007, the Vault Banking 25 surveys banking professionals on the measures that matter most to them. Forget KPIs like assets-to-liabilities, AUM growth, and net profit. Instead, bankers weigh in on dimensions like benefits, hours, training, compensation, and leadership. For the 6th consecutive year, Centerview Partners has remained the best place to work according to bankers themselves. On a 10-point index, Centerview Partners averaged a 9.035 index score, over .10 of a point higher than the previous year. \u00a0Evercore scored an 8.635 average to hold onto the #2 spot, with Moelis & Company again rounding out the top three at 8.221. However, the Vault Banking 25 is poised for a shake-up as PJT Partners and Perella Weinberg Partners each climbed three spots to rank 4th and 5th respectively. VAULT BANKING 25 METHODOLOGY The ranking was compiled by Vault , an intelligence resource that collects employee reviews to provide rankings and in-depth company profiles in areas like law, consulting, banking, accounting, and internships. In addition, Vault provides expert career advice across 14 blogs and over 100 career guides. Among the blogs, Vault covers areas ranging from graduate school to negotiation strategies, while the guides include behavioral interviews, industry-specific jobs, and legal practice areas. In the 2025 banking survey, which was conducted last fall, Vault received roughly 2,800 responses \u2013 or approximately 400 more than the previous year\u2019s sample. To rate employers, Vault applies a 10-point scale, with 10 being the highest possible score. In the survey, respondents are asked to rate their employer across 20 work-life and 6 diversity dimensions (with the latter not factored into Vault\u2019s rankings formula). Like previous years, Firm Culture accounts for a 20% weight, followed by Compensation (10%), Business Outlook (10%), Overall Satisfaction (10%), Work-Life Balance (5%), and Formal and Informal Training (5%). The remaining 40% is devoted to Firm Prestige. Unlike the Work-Life dimensions, where respondents rated their own employers, survey-takers scored the Prestige of competitors with whom they have interacted. Overall, the Vault Banking 25 surveyed professionals from 85 firms, excluding firms that had fewer than 15 responses in any question from the ranking dimension. Story Continues CENTERVIEW ACHIEVES TOP SCORE IN 90% OF WORK-LIFE DIMENSIONS Based in New York City, Centerview Partners is an advisory firm that\u2019s home to over 600 employees. In recent years, Centerview Partners has led or advised on M&A deals that have included PepsiCo, Merck, UBS, L\u2019Or\u00e9al Group, Pfizer, AstraZenca, Oracle, and Blackstone. What sets the firm apart in the Vault 25 Banking Ranking? Think all-around excellence, particularly in pay, culture, work, ad talent. Among the 20 dimensions rated by Vault, Centerview Partners produced the highest average score in 18 of them. That includes every weighed work-life dimension weighed in the ranking except Formal Training (2.5%). In other words, Centerview Partners survey respondents gave their employer the highest marks in the following dimensions: Benefits, Business Outlook, Client Interaction, Compensation, Culture, ESG Practices, Firm Leadership, Hiring Process, Hours, Informal Training, Internal Mobility, Promotion Policies, Quality of Work, Relationships with Managers, Satisfaction, Vacation Policies, Wellness, and Work/Life Balance. What\u2019s more, Centerview Partners climbed to #1 over the past year in Client Interaction and Vacation Policies. \u201cYou work hard, as with all positions within the industry, but you are rewarded with interesting, thought-provoking work in the most complicated situations,\u201d writes one Vault survey-taker. \u201cCenterview is on the forefront of industry-defining transactions across both M&A and restructuring. People genuinely care about your well-being and development, in and outside of the office.\u201d Wall Street pay THE PERKS OF BEING #1 Certainly, Centerview\u2019s perks are market-setters. Picture a caf\u00e9 with an in-house chef providing free breakfasts, lunches, and dinners. There is an on-site gym and internal sports teams. Ubers are free too \u2013 and there is a barista on staff to make the richest coffees.\u00a0 And then there is the pay\u2026 \u201cPay is top of Street by a long shot,\u201d adds another survey respondent. Career development is another differentiator at Centerview Partners. One survey-taker points out that Centerview University trainings and homework are \u201cgraded personally by bankers within the firm.\u201d Another staffer points to the firm\u2019s emphasis on developing homegrown talent through formal mentorship programs, ongoing training, and thoughtful staffing. In other words, Centerview Partners embodies a coaching culture that invests heavily in new talent, expecting them to eventually grow into difference-makers and partners. \u201cA very high level of responsibility is given to team members who are keen to develop their skillset,\u201d according to one Centerview survey respondent. \u201cGiven the teams are small, team members are often given the opportunity to step up and play the role of senior members on the team.\u201d HIGH PERFORMANCE AND HIGH PRESTIGE More than anything, Centerview bankers are bullish on the future. One anonymous respondent observes that \u201cmorale is through the roof,\u201d adding that the firm\u2019s secret weapons are banking fundamentals: \u201cgenuine business insights and flawless execution of deals.\u201d This confidence \u2013 coupled with an expectation of excellence \u2013 permeates the firm top-to-bottom,\u201d adds another survey-taker. \u201cWe have a suite of industry-leading senior bankers with proven abilities to lead the Street across several industries (biotech, healthcare services, consumer, special committee, etc.). Also, senior hires focused on geopolitical expertise has been highly tactical and will continue to become a larger and larger piece of the puzzle for independent advisors. There are lots of tools that Centerview is equipped with that are difficult for the competition to replicate, especially the larger players.\u201d Competing firms are equally upbeat on Centerview Partners\u2019 prospects. The firm achieved the second-highest score in Firm Prestige at 8.328, up .210 of a point over the previous year. At the same time, it narrowed the Prestige gap with Goldman Sachs to .448 of a point \u2013 a difference that was .773 of a point just two years ago. Wall Street EVERCORE DEFINED BY TALENT DEVELOPMENT Evercore again holds down the #2 spot in the Vault Banking 25. Like previous years, Evrecore posted the highest score in the Formal Training dimension. By the same token, Evercore ranked 2nd for both Business Outlook and Hiring Process and Top 5 in 8 other dimensions. The firm also finished 4th in the all-important Prestige dimension, representing a .155 uptick in the process. Among the firm\u2019s marquee attractions, say Vault survey respondents, is the work-life balance. One respondent observes that bankers can work from home on evenings. Even more, Evercore places greater emphasis on work over political considerations like \u2018face time.\u2019 \u201c[The] best aspect is that quality of life is a major focus of our group,\u201d explains one survey respondent. \u201cWeekend hours are audited, and senior members of teams are held accountable if it seems that junior teams have been working unnecessarily\u2026We also respect protected Saturdays (which is enforced, subject to explicit client needs). Individuals are encouraged to take vacation, and teams provide robust coverage so that they are uninterrupted. Our group is very busy, but that has nothing to do with the culture or institution of our group itself; it\u2019s just a testament to the group\u2019s ability to generate high quality work.\u201d Like Centerview Partners, Evercore also emphasizes an apprenticeship culture where senior bankers devote heavy time to developing younger talent. One survey-taker reveals that he is being \u201cactively mentored by multiple senior leaders in the firm,\u201d along with \u201cwork[ing] directly with VPs, MDs, and Senior MDs on deal teams\u201d In a similar fashion, Evercore delivers intensive formal training, with new hires completing a month-long program before they are ever put on the desk. \u201cEvercore has a top training program that equips its incoming analysts with all the skills necessary to succeed.,\u201d adds another Vault respondent from the firm. \u201cThis is in part because the training is specifically designed for Evercore instead of an off-the-shelf training program. Evercore teams also host plenty of networking and mentorship opportunities between junior and seniors. As an intern, I had a 1-on-1 with our chairman and with our global head of investment banking. Such exposure is hard to find anywhere else on the Street.\u201d Next Page: Prestige and Diversity Rankings Plus Access to Full Rankings New York City ACROSS-THE-BOARD EXCELLENCE AT MOELIS The top three is rounded out by Moelis & Company, which most recently advised Spirit AeroSystems during its $8.3 billion dollar acquisition by Boeing. This year, the firm ranked 2nd across 9 dimensions: Firm Leadership, Hours, Internal Mobility, Promotion Policies, Quality of Work, Relationships with Managers, Satisfaction, Wellness, and Work/Life Balance. That doesn\u2019t count ranking Top 5 in another 8 dimensions, including 3rd for Business Outlook and Culture. So why didn\u2019t Moelis & Company overtake Evercore this cycle? Simple: Moelis again ranked 8th in Prestige. On the surface. Moelis & Company may seem to be at a disadvantage in Compensation, where it ranked 5th. However, the firm\u2019s support goes well beyond a paycheck. One survey-taker cited the \u201cgenerous 401K match\u201d and added that maternity leave was longer than peer firms. Another praised the mental health coverage, with Moelis picking up the tab for 12 therapy session. That\u2019s just the start. \u201cWe truly have an incredible compensation package here at Moelis. We are given comprehensive benefits that extend beyond that of the average offering,\u201d explains one survey-taker. \u201cThe Moelis package includes medical, dental, vision, and basic life/AD&D insurance, as well as the option to open an HSA (Health Savings Account), enroll with a virtual doctor through Teladoc, and, last but absolutely not least, sign up for Lyra Health, where you are connected with a mental health professional to navigate your emotions and work on developing plans to grow!\u201d Even more, Moelis is considered safe and stable according to one Vault respondent, noting the firm \u201c[isn\u2019t] as susceptible to public market swings or as exposed to external risks\u201d being strictly an advisory firm. That said, another banker mentioned that the firm wasn\u2019t resting on its laurels, moving into new areas like sports, gaming, and the Middle East. \u201cMoelis is trending in the right direction,\u201d adds another staffer. \u201cWe have increased our deal flow while continuing to build meaningful client relationships. We are in growth mode and have been given business opportunities to expand our portfolio and drive efficiencies.\u201d PJT PARTNERS EARNS HIGH MARKS Looking for some firms to watch? Start with PJT Partners, which moved from 7th to 5th while its index score improved from 7.797 to 8.121. Yes, PJT Partners is definitely a firm on the rise. They also made several big leaps in the rankings this year. In the Vault Banking 25, they ranked #4 this year, up from #7 last year. The firm cracked the Top 3 in the ESG Practices and Hiring Process dimensions. It has also continued its slow climb up in Prestige, moving from 8th to 6th in the past two years, while seeing its score improve from 6.891 to 7.182 in the past year alone. Derek Loosvelt, editorial director at Vault, pegs PJT Partners as a mover in a statement to P&Q. \u201cIn benefits, they rose to #5 from\u00a0#8. And in prestige, they rose a spot to #6 from #7. PJT Partners was spun off from Blackstone about a decade ago, and ever since, PJT Partners has been on the rise, their (new) name becoming more and more widely known.\u00a0Today, PJT Partners regularly works on some of the largest, most complex M&A deals on the Street (T-Mobile\u2019s $59 billion merger with Sprint, and Sky\u2019s $48 million sale to Comcast, to name a couple), and it treats its junior team very well. The firm\u2019s bankers particularly appreciate\u00a0the remote-work periods in August (three weeks remote), the week of\u00a0Thanksgiving, and the end of December. And they also tell us that the senior team\u00a0makes an effort to enable junior\u00a0bankers to take time off and are understanding of outside commitments and responsibilities, especially if people have young families.\u201d BANKS TO WATCH Parella Weinberg is on a similar roll, moving from 8th to 5th. One reason: the firm broke into the Top 3 in several dimensions, including Compensation, Culture, and Satisfaction, worth a combined 40% of the ranking weight. It also climbed into the Top 3 in 5 more dimensions, while slipping into the Top 10 for Prestige. \u201cIn compensation,\u00a0Perella Weinberg\u00a0rose to #2 this year from #6 last year. In culture, they ranked #2, up from #7. And in work/life balance they made their most impressive leap, rising to #4 from #13,\u201d says Loosvelt. \u201cAs for why they made such\u00a0large\u00a0leaps, Perella Weinberg\u2019s bankers told us\u00a0that the firm\u00a0now\u00a0places a strong emphasis on work/life balance and has a firmwide goal of making sure all employees use all their vacation days. They also told us that the firm is very supportive of protected weekends and\u00a0that\u00a0the benefits program is the best on the Street.\u201d Houlihan Lokey takes the honor for the biggest improvement, going from 25th to 11th, though this stemmed from the firm not qualifying for the ranking last year. According to survey-takers, Houlihan Lokey\u2019s biggest strength was Client Interaction, where it ranked 4th. Beyond that, the Vault Banking 25 was a model of stability. Lazard lost two spots, going from 4th to 6th. However, it boasted the highest score for International Opportunities (and 2nd-best for ESG Practices and Informal Training\u2026plus 3rd-best for Work-Life Balance).\u00a0 Guggenheim Securities tumbled 3 spots to 8th, though it remained a Top 3 firm for both Compensation and Formal Training. Beyond this, no firms gained or lost more than one spot, though Solomon Partners tumbled out of the Top 25, while UBS made its debut at #25. A LOOK INSIDE GOLDMAN SACHS While Prestige is a component of the Vault Banking 25 weighting system, it is also treated as a separate ranking. Here, Goldman Sachs continues to top the list according to survey respondents who compete against the firm. This year, Golden Sachs averaged 8.776 in Prestige, up .111 of a point. However, Goldman Sachs didn\u2019t participate in the quality of work and life survey responses, os it could rank no higher than 16th. Still, Vault was able to secure several survey responses from employee. In terms of compensation, the sentiment was mixed. One respondent from a previous year described Goldman Saches base pay as \u201crelatively low\u201d \u2013 but adds that \u201coverall compensation increases significantly over time.\u201d Another survey-taker was more upbeat on the package overall. \u201cSalary is very competitive, and formulaic comp means you always have a good sense of your pay. Also, how the firm does in any given year doesn\u2019t impact you, medical and 401(k) options are best-in-breed, and the on-site gym is state-of-the-art. In general, it\u2019s a healthy compensation package with good perks.\u201d When it comes to Goldman Sach\u2019s outlook, respondents seem cautiously optimistic. \u201cWe\u2019re going through lots of change, which is difficult,\u201d writes one respondent summing up the mood. \u201cNew leadership is changing the structure of the firm; time will tell how this plays out, but at this point I feel confident on our ability to deliver. The change seems purposeful, strategic, well-planned, and provides an exciting and bright future.\u201d JPMorgan Chase Office. iStock photo JP MORGAN CHASE PRAISED FOR FLEXIBILITY JP Morgan Chase, which ranked 17th overall due to also not participating in the quality of work and life survey, ranked 3rd for Prestige. Among past survey respondents, career mobility is a common theme at the firm. \u201cJ.P. Morgan has a collegial culture and emphasizes mentoring of junior staff,\u201d writes one respondent. \u201cI\u2019ve been at several banks on Wall Street, and J.P. Morgan has the best/most organized training of junior staff. J.P. Morgan is also a big firm, and I\u2019ve seen employees transition from one part of the bank to another (especially if you do a solid job and have a good internal rating on performance reviews and the support of your manager). Moving within the bank to pursue an opportunity outside of your line of business is not an impossible task.\u201d As a whole, survey respondents were upbeat about JP Morgan Chase\u2019s prospects\u2026with a few caveats. \u201cOur businesses are very strong. Any setbacks will be due to the overabundance of regulatory changes\u2014which is an issue for the entire industry. We have very good leadership at our firm. My only knock is on the diversity front. We should be better, and the leadership needs to telegraph that and measure it.\u201d CENTERVIEW PARTNERS ALSO EXCELS IN DIVERSITY While diversity measures weren\u2019t baked into the Vault Banking 25 methodology, they remained a strength for Centerview Partners. The firm achieved the highest score across 5 of 6 diversity measures: Overall Diversity, LGBTQ+, Racial and Ethnic Diversity, Women, and Employees with Disabilities. It also finished 2nd among Military Veterans. According to one Vault survey-taker, the firm maintains several employee resource groups, including one for first generation employees. Another respondent praises the firm for its inclusive recruiting practices. And a third employee brought up Centerview Partners\u2019 efforts to retain underrepresented groups. \u201cAt the junior level, for example, it is often the case that analyst classes have more females than males. Military veteran hiring in the U.S. office is very strong\u2014and some very strong employees in the U.S. office have military backgrounds.\u201d HOURS ARE OVERRATED Alongside the ranking, Vault also identified several themes in banking. For one, bankers have been disappointed with many of their employers\u2019 back-to-work mandates, preferring a more hybrid model. In some cases, this dissatisfaction stems from a double-standard according to one survey respondent. \u201cWhile we talk about work/life balance, many leaders don\u2019t follow that narrative. We have a culture of \u2018in the office,\u2019 which is a problem and doesn\u2019t support quality of life balances, as it requires employees to commute long hours, pay pricey parking fees, and spend less time with their families.\u201d Alas, banking is an industry where top performers come in with red eyes and live off Red Bulls. In a surprise, Vault found many several survey-takers didn\u2019t mind grinding through grueling hours and intense spikes. The difference between drudgery and delight, however, was rooted in the fundamentals: pay, support, and pause. \u201cThe hours can be long, the deadlines tight, and schedules get blown up,\u201d muses one respondent, \u201cbut your team always has your back and once the crisis is past, staffing and senior leadership work diligently to make sure you get a break to recover.\u201d WHY BANKING IS ON THE UPSWING In five years, banking may be far beyond the long hours in the office debate. This week, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon told attendees at the Cisco AI Summit that Artificial Intelligence could write 95% of an IPO prospectus \u2013 and handle it in a few minutes. Does that mean investment banking could be a lean operation in the future? For Vault\u2019s Derek Loosvelt, the bigger question is what students and young students can do now to be indispensable in the wake of AI\u2019s growth. \u201cAI is impacting every industry and every role,\u201d he tells P&Q . \u201cIn banking and finance, what\u2019s important right now for professionals and students to do is not to try to predict which roles will be obsolete but to develop expertise in certain AI tools, data science, machine learning, etc. This will allow current and future finance professionals to stay competitive\u00a0in the constantly changing workplace. Also, it\u2019s important for banking professionals to continue to develop their soft skills like problem-solving, teamwork, empathy, communication, leadership, and critical thinking. These and other soft skills will continue to be highly sought after. Those experienced professionals and new grads with these types of skills will be better able to adapt as AI tools continue to be rolled out.\u201d When it comes to the usual debate on whether banking is losing ground to consulting and tech in the battle for talent, Loosvelt has seen some reason for optimism in banking. \u201cWhat\u2019s probably had the largest effect are the cuts in tech. Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Intel, Cisco, and others made significant and highly publicized layoffs last year. And this certainly made choosing tech over banking less attractive. In the past decade, there\u2019s been a massive talent war for MBA grads between Silicon Valley and Wall Street, and those tech cuts were a win for Wall Street in that war. Other than that, what comes to mind is I do think the top banks are catching up with the top tech firms when it comes to offering top-notch benefits and perks.

Outlook Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 7:03 PM 4 min read In This Article: TECK -1.93% CRS -0.99% Teck Resources Limited TECK announced fourth-quarter and 2024 production and sales volumes. TECK\u2019s Production & Sales Update In the fourth quarter of 2024, Teck Resources sold 124,900 tons and produced a record 122,100 tons of copper. The company\u2019s annual copper production came in at 446,000 tons, within its guidance of 420,000-455,000 tons. The upside in production was driven by the ramp-up of Quebrada Blanca, which achieved design throughput rates by the end of 2024. Fourth-quarter 2024 sales and production of zinc came in at 204,000 tons and 146,400 tons, respectively. The annual production of 615,900 tons of zinc came within the company's expectations, driven by the higher year-over-year annual production at Red Dog. The refined zinc production for the fourth quarter of 2024 was 62,100 tons, whereas sales were 61,100 tons. The annual refined zinc production was slightly higher than the guidance at 256,600 tons. Teck Resources\u2019 Other Updates TECK sold its steelmaking coal business (\u201cEVR\u201d) in 2024 to position itself as a pure-play energy transition metals business focused on copper and zinc. Teck Resources intends to allocate proceeds from the transactions in accordance with its Capital Allocation Framework. The allocation strategy includes cash returns to shareholders, reducing debt, setting aside cash for taxes and transaction costs, and retaining funds for strategic copper projects that drive long-term value growth. In 2024, Teck Resources executed $1.25-billion from its authorized share buyback program of $3.25 billion. The company lowered its debt by $1.6 billion through a bond tender offer for public notes in July 2024 and additional debt repayments in the second half of the year. TECK\u2019s 2025 Guidance The company predicts total copper production at 490,000-565,000 tons in 2025. The total zinc concentrate production in 2025 is estimated between 525,000 and 570,000 tons. The refined zinc production is estimated at 190,000-300,000 tons for 2025. The zinc production over the next three years is likely to fall because of deteriorating grades at Red Dog. Capital expenditure in 2025 is estimated to be lower than that recorded in 2024, owing to decreased spending. Teck Resources\u2019 Stock Price Performance The company\u2019s shares have gained 16.3% in the past year against the industry\u2019s 7.8% fall.

Evercore would replace Bausch\u2019s previous investment bank, Houlihan Lokey, said some of the people, all of whom asked not to be named discussing private information. Representatives for White & Case, Proskauer and Evercore did not respond to requests for comment. Representatives for Houlihan Lokey and for Laval, Quebec-based Bausch declined to comment. In their dealings with the company, holders of much of Bausch\u2019s debt have been operating under a creditor pact that has complicated efforts to spin off or sell Bausch + Lomb, Bloomberg previously reported. Those plans were first publicized by Bausch in 2020, when the announcement sent shares soaring 18%. The Bausch creditors formed that cooperation unit to protect their rights and interests during the type of debt negotiations that have otherwise seen lenders compete against each other for deals that elevate some over others in rank and payment priority. Bausch + Lomb in December confirmed that a sale was \u201cone of several options being explored to complete a full separation from Bausch Health Companies Inc.,\u201d making the statement in response to a request for information from the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization. The Financial Times reported the same month that the private equity firm Blackstone was losing interest in making a bid for the company. It had previously reported that potential bidders included Blackstone, Advent International and TPG Capital. The trade publication Octus previously reported on Bausch hiring Proskauer Rose.
