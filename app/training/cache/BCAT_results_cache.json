Announce Tender Offer in Conjunction with Results of the Quarterly Measurement Period of their Discount Management Programs Business Wire Fri, Jan 3, 2025, 12:30 AM 8 min read In This Article: BCX -1.11% BGY -1.81% BME +0.02% BDJ -0.23% BGR +0.91% NEW YORK, January 02, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--The BlackRock closed-end funds (the \"Funds\") listed below announced today the results of the Quarterly Measurement Period (as defined below) under their previously announced discount management programs (the \"Programs\"). Funds with a Trigger Event (as defined below) at the end of the Quarterly Measurement Period also announced the dates of tender offers. The Programs are part of the Funds\u2019 ongoing efforts to manage discounts and enhance long-term shareholder value and provide liquidity to the market for their common shareholders. There can be no assurances as to the effect that a Program will have on the market for a Fund\u2019s shares or the discount at which a Fund\u2019s shares may trade relative to its NAV. As previously announced, under the Programs, each Fund intends to offer to repurchase a portion of its outstanding common shares based on 3-month measurement periods (each a \"Measurement Period\") if the Fund's common shares trade at an average daily discount to net asset value (\"NAV\") of greater than 7.50% during a Measurement Period (a \"Trigger Event\"). The Funds\u2019 Measurement Period commenced on October 1, 2024 and ended on December 31, 2024 (the \"Quarterly Measurement Period\"). The average daily discount to NAV for each of the Funds during the Quarterly Measurement Period is summarized below. Quarterly Measurement Period Discount Results for the Funds in the Program Fund Name Ticker Average Daily Discount for the Measurement Period ended December 31, 2024 BlackRock Capital Allocation Term Trust BCAT -5.19% BlackRock ESG Capital Allocation Term Trust ECAT -4.71% BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust BIGZ -10.52% BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust BMEZ -10.91% BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust BSTZ -9.58% BlackRock Enhanced Global Dividend Trust BOE -10.36% BlackRock Energy and Resources Trust BGR -8.74% BlackRock Enhanced International Dividend Trust BGY -10.08% BlackRock Enhanced Large Cap Core Fund, Inc.

MVF -8.28% BlackRock Utilities, Infrastructure, & Power Opportunities Trust BUI -1.35% The Funds\u2019 Boards of Directors/Trustees (the \"Boards\") determined that if a Trigger Event occurred during the Quarterly Measurement Period with respect to a Fund, the Fund would offer to repurchase a portion of its outstanding common shares by conducting a tender offer for 2.5% of its outstanding common shares at a price equal to 98% of the Fund\u2019s NAV per share as determined as of the close of the regular trading session of the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") on the next day the NAV is calculated after the expiration date of the tender offer or, if the offer is extended, on the next day the NAV is calculated after the day to which the offer is extended. As a result of the occurrence of a Trigger Event during the Quarterly Measurement Period with respect to each of the following Funds, the Board of each such Fund has authorized the Fund\u2019s tender offer with the anticipated commencement and expiration dates outlined below. Story Continues Event MVF, BME BGR, BIGZ, BMEZ, CII BGY, BSTZ, BOE, BCX Tender Offer Commencement Date Tuesday, January 21, 2025 Wednesday, January 22, 2025 Thursday, January 23, 2025 Tender Offer Expiration Date and Time Thursday, February 20, 2025 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, unless otherwise extended Friday, February 21, 2025 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, unless otherwise extended Monday, February 24, 2025 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, unless otherwise extended If more than 2.5% of a Fund's outstanding common shares are tendered, the Fund will purchase its shares from tendering shareholders on a pro rata basis at a price equal to 98% of the Fund's NAV per share as determined as of the close of the regular trading session of the NYSE on the next day the NAV is calculated after the expiration date of the tender offer (or, if the offer is extended, on the next day the NAV is calculated after the day to which the offer is extended). Accordingly, there is no assurance that a Fund will purchase all of a shareholder\u2019s common shares tendered in the tender offer. Payments for shares tendered and accepted are expected to be made within approximately five business days after the expiration date. The terms and conditions of each Fund\u2019s tender offer will be set forth in an Offer to Purchase, a related Letter of Transmittal, and related documents, which will be distributed to the respective Fund's common shareholders. As soon as its tender offer commences, each Fund will file a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), which will include an Offer to Purchase and related Letter of Transmittal.
