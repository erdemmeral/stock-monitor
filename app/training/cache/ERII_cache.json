Trends towards conservation and reducing groundwater depletion are putting water infrastructure and treatment products front and center. Companies that can innovate and create solutions\u2013especially automated or connected solutions\u2013to address these thematic trends will create incremental demand and speed up replacement cycles. On the other hand, water infrastructure and treatment companies are at the whim of economic cycles. Consumer spending and interest rates, for example, can greatly impact the industrial production that drives demand for these companies\u2019 offerings. The 5 water infrastructure stocks we track reported a strong Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 1.2%. While some water infrastructure stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they have collectively declined. On average, share prices are down 3.8% since the latest earnings results. Mueller Water Products (NYSE:MWA) As one of the oldest companies in the water infrastructure industry, Mueller (NYSE:MWA) is a provider of water infrastructure products and flow control systems for various sectors.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Strong Momentum Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

(NASDAQ:ERII) On Your Watch List? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sun, Dec 22, 2024, 4:10 PM 3 min read In This Article: ERII -1.39% While Energy Recovery, Inc. ( NASDAQ:ERII ) might not have the largest market cap around , it saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$19.93 and falling to the lows of US$14.66. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Energy Recovery's current trading price of US$15.14 reflective of the actual value of the small-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Energy Recovery\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Energy Recovery What Is Energy Recovery Worth? According to our price multiple model, where we compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. In this instance, we\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock\u2019s cash flows. We find that Energy Recovery\u2019s ratio of 45.22x is above its peer average of 22.59x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Machinery industry. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that Energy Recovery\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility. Can we expect growth from Energy Recovery? NasdaqGS:ERII Earnings and Revenue Growth December 22nd 2024 Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Energy Recovery. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation. What This Means For You Are you a shareholder? ERII\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question \u2013 should I sell? If you believe ERII should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed. Story Continues Are you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on ERII for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for ERII, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

Earth Tue, Dec 17, 2024, 3:53 PM 14 min read In This Article: ERII -1.39% IPXX -1.52% IPXXU -5.81% IPXXW +3.54% USA Rare Earth NEW YORK, Dec. 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- USA Rare Earth, LLC (\u201cUSARE\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), announced today that Joshua Ballard has been named Chief Executive Officer effective December 17, 2024. USARE\u2019s mission is to establish a vertically integrated, domestic rare earth magnet supply chain that includes heavy rare earth elements and other critical minerals, such as gallium. USARE is developing a NdFeB magnet manufacturing plant in the United States, and establishing domestic rare earth elements and critical minerals supply, extraction, and processing capabilities to both supply its magnet manufacturing plant and market surplus materials to third-parties. Mr. Ballard is a seasoned executive with over 20 years of leadership experience in senior level finance and operations positions across public and private companies, as well as private equity and venture capital teams. Most recently, he served as the CFO of Energy Recovery, Inc. (Nasdaq: ERII) (\u201cEnergy Recovery\u201d), an energy efficiency technology and manufacturing company. During Mr. Ballard\u2019s tenure, his contributions led to strategic improvements in diversifying Energy Recovery\u2019s revenue growth and launching new products across multiple industries while increasing annual revenue growth over five years. \u201cWe are pleased to announce the appointment of Josh as CEO,\u201d said Tready Smith, USARE\u2019s Board Chair. \u201cUSARE is at an exciting stage of its growth, and we believe Josh has the right skillset to develop the Company into a vertically integrated U.S. rare earth magnet producer, working to become a leading domestic supplier. Josh brings a proven track record as a public company executive, and we believe his extensive manufacturing experience and strategic approach will be great assets to lead USARE into this next chapter.\u201d \u201cGlobal geopolitical tensions continue to increase, and there is a clear and strategic imperative to re-establish the U.S. rare earth supply chain that was abandoned in recent decades. USARE not only has the potential to become the premier U.S. rare earth magnet producer, but we believe its mining rights over a world-class heavy rare earth and critical minerals deposit in Texas (which includes gallium) uniquely positions the Company to play a key role in supplying these minerals to the United States and its partners globally in support of critical technologies,\u201d said Ballard. \u201cI am excited to work with the USARE team to achieve this incredible vision and, as a first step, working towards taking the company public and commencing magnet production at our facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma.\u201d Story Continues The Company previously announced that it had entered into a Business Combination Agreement with Inflection Point Acquisition Corp. II (Nasdaq: IPXX) (\u201cIPXX\u201d) and IPXX Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Inflection Point, on August 21, 2024 (the \u201cBusiness Combination Agreement\u201d and the transactions contemplated by that agreement, the \u201cProposed Business Combination\u201d), which will result in the combined company being a publicly traded company. Michael Blitzer, CEO of IPXX, added: \u201cWe are thrilled to welcome Josh to USARE. His track record of creating shareholder value and leading important infrastructure businesses aligns with the Company\u2019s vision to become the first large scale integrated rare earth magnet producer in North America. We are confident he will be a transformative leader at this critical juncture, as securing a domestic supply chain for critical resources has become a national priority.\u201d About USA Rare Earth, LLC USA Rare Earth, LLC is a company building a vertically integrated, domestic rare earth magnet supply chain.

Energy Recovery's (NASDAQ:ERII) Returns On Capital editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Thu, Dec 5, 2024, 2:20 PM 2 min read In This Article: ERII -1.39% If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Energy Recovery ( NASDAQ:ERII ) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be. What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)? For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Energy Recovery is: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.06 = US$15m \u00f7 (US$263m - US$19m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024) . Therefore, Energy Recovery has an ROCE of 6.0%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Machinery industry average of 13%. Check out our latest analysis for Energy Recovery NasdaqGS:ERII Return on Capital Employed December 5th 2024 Above you can see how the current ROCE for Energy Recovery compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Energy Recovery for free. What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us In terms of Energy Recovery's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 6.0% from 7.8% five years ago. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run. The Key Takeaway While returns have fallen for Energy Recovery in recent times, we're encouraged to see that sales are growing and that the business is reinvesting in its operations. Furthermore the stock has climbed 85% over the last five years, it would appear that investors are upbeat about the future. So should these growth trends continue, we'd be optimistic on the stock going forward.
