[{"text": "Amplify Energy to merge with Juniper Capital\u2019s upstream Rocky Mountain companies TipRanks Thu, Jan 16, 2025, 3:16 PM 2 min read In This Article: AMPY -2.25% https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/amplify-energy-to-merge-with-juniper-capitals-upstream-rocky-mountain-companies Amplify Energy ( AMPY ) has entered into a definitive merger agreement with privately held Juniper Capital to combine with certain Juniper portfolio companies which own substantial oil-weighted producing assets and significant leasehold interests in the DJ and Powder River Basins. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Amplify will issue Juniper approximately 26.7M shares of Amplify common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and assume approximately $133M in net debt. Pro forma for the Transaction, Amplify shareholders will retain approximately 61% of Amplify\u2019s outstanding equity and approximately 39% will be owned by Juniper. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions, including obtaining the requisite shareholder and regulatory approvals. The transaction adds approximately 19 MMBoe of Proved Developed Reserves, with a PV10 value of over $330 MM, and also adds approximately 287,000 net acres in the DJ and Powder River Basins in Wyoming adjacent to some of the largest publicly traded U.S. oil companies. Over 115,000 of the net acres are operated and held-by-production, with a high average working interest of approximately 90%. The large held-by-production position and multi-year term on a majority of the undeveloped acreage is expected to allow Amplify to opportunistically develop the assets over time. In the third quarter of 2024, average daily production of the acquired assets was approximately 7,900 net Boe. These assets generate strong margins with low operating costs, which we expect to improve operating metrics across the combined company. In addition, the acquired assets will be integrated into the existing platform with minimal incremental overhead costs, and the Company intends to continue streamlining the organization as it optimizes its portfolio of assets. The transaction is expected to be significantly accretive to free cash flow in 2025 and over a 5-year time horizon. Amplify expects to benefit from material synergies including from optimizing overhead at the combined operations and from income tax savings related to the stepped-up basis of the acquired companies. Edward Geiser and Josh Schmidt, both partners at Juniper Capital, will join Amplify\u2019s Board of Directors, replacing two of Amplify\u2019s existing Board members. Amplify\u2019s management team will lead the combined company and will supplement the operational team with key hires to support the Rockies assets.

Juniper Capital\u2019s Upstream Rocky Mountain Portfolio Companies Amplify Energy Corp. Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 3:00 PM 12 min read In This Article: AMPY -2.25% Amplify Energy Corp. HOUSTON, Jan. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amplify Energy Corp. (NYSE: AMPY) (\u201cAmplify,\u201d the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) announced today that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d and the transactions contemplated thereby, the \u201cTransaction\u201d) with privately held Juniper Capital (\u201cJuniper\u201d) to combine with certain Juniper portfolio companies which own substantial oil-weighted producing assets and significant leasehold interests in the DJ and Powder River Basins. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Amplify will issue Juniper approximately 26.7 million shares of Amplify common stock ( 1) , par value $0.01 per share, and assume approximately $133 million in net debt ( 2 ) . Pro forma for the Transaction, Amplify shareholders will retain approximately 61% of Amplify\u2019s outstanding equity and approximately 39% will be owned by Juniper. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions, including obtaining the requisite shareholder and regulatory approvals. Strategic Rationale and Benefits Substantially\u00a0Increases Scale The transaction adds approximately 19 MMBoe of Proved Developed Reserves, with a PV10 value of over $330 MM ( 3 ) , and also adds approximately 287,000 net acres in the DJ and Powder River Basins in Wyoming adjacent to some of the largest publicly traded U.S. oil companies. Over 115,000 of the net acres are operated and held-by-production, with a high average working interest of approximately 90%. The large held-by-production position and multi-year term on a majority of the undeveloped acreage is expected to allow Amplify to opportunistically develop the assets over time. Materially\u00a0Improves Operating Metrics and Corporate Efficiency In the third quarter of 2024, average daily production of the acquired assets was approximately 7,900 net Boe (81% oil, 90% liquids) ( 4 ) . These assets generate strong margins with low operating costs, which we expect to improve operating metrics across the combined company. In addition, the acquired assets will be integrated into the existing platform with minimal incremental overhead costs, and the Company intends to continue streamlining the organization as it optimizes its portfolio of assets. Increases Organic Growth Opportunities Amplify has identified hundreds of potential high-quality, operated drilling locations to complement Amplify\u2019s existing development inventory. Target formations include the Codell formation in the DJ Basin, near properties held by EOG Resources, and multiple formations including the Parkman, Turner, Niobrara and Mowry in the Powder River Basin near properties held by EOG Resources, Devon, Occidental and other large operators. Story Continues Significant Accretion and Synergies The transaction is expected to be significantly accretive to free cash flow ( 5 ) in 2025 and over a 5-year time horizon. Amplify expects to benefit from material synergies including from optimizing overhead at the combined operations and from income tax savings related to the stepped-up basis of the acquired companies. Creates a Focal Area for Further Consolidation Opportunities The large acreage position and operating footprint in premier Rocky Mountain Basins provide the Company with a new core area for future consolidation opportunities with the potential for accretive bolt-on acquisitions from smaller private companies or non-core assets of larger operators. Additionally, the more broadly scaled pro forma asset base will afford Amplify flexibility in optimizing cash flow and production across its portfolio. Martyn Willsher, Amplify\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer commented, \u201cWe are excited to partner with the Juniper Capital team in this transformational merger to create immediate and long-term value for Amplify\u2019s shareholders. This transaction adds a new oil-rich area with significant current production and substantial upside to the Company\u2019s asset base. Juniper\u2019s assets in the Rockies complement Amplify\u2019s ongoing development of our Beta Field and our strong cash flow from our legacy onshore assets. We believe that the Rockies area will experience substantial growth in the coming years, and we look forward to developing this position, while becoming more organizationally focused and efficient.\u201d Edward Geiser, Juniper\u2019s Managing Partner, added, \u201cThe combination of our Rockies assets with Amplify\u2019s existing operations creates a differentiated public company with strong cash flow and deep inventory. The combined company will have the flexibility to grow organically within its existing asset base and to pursue strategic consolidation in highly economic areas where few other large companies are currently focused. We believe Martyn and his team at Amplify are optimally suited to lead the combined operations, and we are excited about being a long-term investor in the Company.\u201d Board of Directors and Management Edward (\u201cEddie\u201d) Geiser and Josh Schmidt, both partners at Juniper Capital, will join Amplify\u2019s Board of Directors, replacing two of Amplify\u2019s existing Board members. Amplify\u2019s management team will lead the combined company and will supplement the operational team with key hires to support the Rockies assets. Chris Hamm, Amplify\u2019s Chairman commented, \u201cWe are delighted to welcome Eddie and Josh to the Amplify Board. The Juniper team has a long track record of success in the oil and gas industry, most notably their efforts in leading Ranger Oil Corporation\u2019s highly successful consolidation strategy in the Eagle Ford. We look forward to benefiting from their experience and working closely with them to drive incremental value to Amplify\u2019s shareholders.\u201d Advisors Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc. served as Amplify\u2019s financial advisor for this transaction and Kirkland\u00a0& Ellis, LLP served as Amplify\u2019s legal advisors. Wells Fargo served as Juniper\u2019s financial advisor for this transaction and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP served as Juniper\u2019s legal advisors.

Footnotes 1) Share consideration calculated based on fully diluted Amplify shares as of January 13, 2025 including approximately 39.9 MM shares outstanding plus approximately 1.9 MM unvested equity awards previously granted under the Amplify employee incentive plans and measured at target. 2) Net debt consists of $140 MM outstanding as of 12/31/2024 less $2 MM of cash and pro-forma of $5 MM of cash to be contributed by Juniper before the closing date. 3) Reserves and PV10 based on DeGolyer and MacNaughton midyear prepared report effective as of 10/1/2024 and utilizing strip pricing as of 10/25/2024; (NYMEX WTI, HH) - Bal24: $71.69, $2.75; 2025: $69.68, $3.25; 2026: $67.55, $3.62. PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents the present value of estimated future cash inflows from proved oil and natural gas reserves that are calculated using the unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month prices for the prior 12 months, less future development and operating costs, discounted at 10% per annum to reflect the timing of future cash flows. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to PV-10 is standardized measure. PV-10 differs from standardized measure in its treatment of estimated future income taxes, which are excluded from PV-10. Amplify believes the presentation of PV-10 provides useful information because it is widely used by investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies without regard to specific income tax characteristics of such entities. PV-10 is not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated proved reserves. PV-10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure as defined under GAAP. The Company also presents PV-10 at strip pricing, which is PV-10 adjusted for price sensitivities. As GAAP does not prescribe a comparable GAAP measure for PV-10 of reserves adjusted for pricing sensitivities, it is not practicable for us to reconcile PV-10 at strip pricing to a standardized measure or any other GAAP measure. 4) Based on preliminary third quarter 2024 unaudited results. 5) Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that is derived from the standardized measures of net income or net cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow is an important non-GAAP financial measure for Amplify\u2019s investors since it serves as an indicator of the Company\u2019s success in providing a cash return on investment. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to free cash flow are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. The Company does not provide guidance on the items used to reconcile between forecasted free cash flow to forecasted net income and net cash provided by operating activities due to the uncertainty regarding timing and estimates of certain items. Therefore, we cannot reconcile forecasted free cash flow to net income or net cash provided by operating activities without unreasonable effort.

into More Strength? Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 12:52 PM 2 min read In This Article: LNG +2.64% AMPY -2.25% Cheniere Energy (LNG) shares soared 6% in the last trading session to close at $243.09. The move was backed by solid volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This compares to the stock's 9% gain over the past four weeks. Cheniere Energy's recent stock surge reflects investor optimism fueled by the incoming Trump administration's proposed policy shifts to promote the fossil fuel industry and LNG exports. Key measures include plans to lift the freeze on LNG export approvals, which would expand U.S. LNG markets, and rollbacks of environmental regulations, signaling a broader pro-business and deregulation agenda that benefits LNG exporters. Combined with the administration's focus on energy dominance through increased offshore drilling and fossil fuel production, these initiatives create a favorable environment for Cheniere Energy's growth. Additionally, a recent rise in natural gas prices, driven by colder weather and higher demand for heating, has boosted Cheniere\u2019s shares. The increase in natural gas prices and the potential for more LNG exports make Cheniere an attractive investment, further driving its stock performance. This natural gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.74 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -52.4%. Revenues are expected to be $4.41 billion, down 8.7% from the year-ago quarter. While earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. For Cheniere Energy, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.7% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. And a positive trend in earnings estimate revision usually translates into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on LNG going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Down 8% Since Q3: What to Do With the Stock? Nilanjan Choudhury Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 4:41 PM 4 min read In This Article: AMPY -2.25% Earlier this month, Amplify Energy AMPY released its third-quarter 2024 results. The oil and gas producer did exceed third-quarter earnings expectations, but a closer analysis of the report revealed some underlying concerns. AMPY faces challenges from rising capital expenditures and increasing debt, which could strain its free cash flow and limit financial flexibility. Additionally, declining production levels signal potential operational inefficiencies, which might have weighed on investor confidence. Since the results on Sept. 6, Amplify Energy shares have slid more than 8%, underperforming the sector and the S&P 500. AMPY Share Price Performance Since Q3 Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Warning Signs for AMPY Despite the Headline Beat Elevated Capital Expenditures: Amplify\u2019s capital expenditures are expected to hit the high end of its annual guidance of $60-$65 million due to accelerated non-operated development costs. This increase in spending could weigh on free cash flow, which was $3.6 million in Q3 2024, marking a decline compared to prior periods. Stay up-to-date with the quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar. Production Decline: Total production for the third quarter averaged 19,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), a sequential decline of 1,300 BOE/d, attributed to planned shut-ins and facility upgrades. If these issues persist, they may hinder revenue growth. Rising Debt Levels and Interest Costs: Amplify\u2019s net debt rose to $120 million by the end of the quarter, primarily due to working capital changes and heightened development activity. Interest expenses were $3.8 million, up $0.2 million from the previous quarter. This growing financial burden could limit the company\u2019s ability to manage market volatility or invest in strategic initiatives. At the same time, AMPY\u2019s Q3 disclosure offered a few encouraging signs. There are positives that suggest the company has opportunities to navigate challenges and drive future growth. Amplify Energy\u2019s Growth Drivers Beta Development Program: Amplify\u2019s Beta development program continues to deliver strong results. The newly completed C59 well, which came online in early October, achieved an IP30 oil production rate of 590 barrels per day, surpassing expectations. Additional wells, including the C48 well, are projected to drive further output in November, positioning Amplify for sustainable long-term production gains. Strong Hedge Positions: Amplify has secured extensive crude oil and natural gas hedges, covering 75-80% of its forecasted crude production for 2024 and 2025. Weighted average prices of $69.39 per barrel for 2025 provide a stable revenue stream, mitigating risks from volatile commodity markets and ensuring predictable cash flows. Consistent Free Cash Flow Generation: Amplify\u2019s track record of generating positive free cash flow \u2014 17 out of the last 18 quarters \u2014 demonstrates its financial resilience. The company\u2019s focus on cost optimization and efficient capital allocation further strengthens its ability to invest in growth opportunities. Story Continues A Word on Amplify Energy\u2019s Valuation From a valuation standpoint, Amplify Energy looks appealing, as it is currently trading below its five-year median. Using the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value to Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortization) metric, the company is also priced at a significant discount compared to peers such as W&T Offshore WTI and Ring Energy REI \u2014 two similar upstream firms in the energy sector with comparable market caps to AMPY. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research AMPY\u2019s Sensitivity to Oil Prices Before taking any decision, investors should keep in mind that Amplify Energy faces significant risk from fluctuating oil prices, which directly impact its cash flow and profitability. Crude recently dipped below $70 on concerns over weaker global demand, lackluster Chinese economic stimulus, and a surging U.S. dollar. AMPY\u2019s earnings are at risk if prices remain suppressed. Takeaway: Amplify Stock Remains a Hold Amplify Energy\u2019s Beta development enhances its long-term production potential. Its consistent ability to generate positive free cash flow strengthens its financial flexibility. However, there are too many challenges at play. Consequently, this might not be the ideal time to invest in the upstream operator. However, those who already own this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock may stay invested.

Article: AMPY -2.25% Amplify Energy (AMPY) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.54 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.32 per share. This compares to loss of $0.34 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 68.75%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this oil and gas company would post earnings of $0.31 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.17, delivering a surprise of -45.16%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. Amplify Energy , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, posted revenues of $69.86 million for the quarter ended September 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.43%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $76.77 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Amplify Energy shares have added about 13.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 21.2%. What's Next for Amplify Energy? While Amplify Energy has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Amplify Energy: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

(NYSE:AMPY) has piqued the interest of institutional investors editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Thu, Dec 19, 2024, 4:22 PM 4 min read In This Article: AMPY -2.25% Key Insights Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Amplify Energy's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions 48% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Using data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a company A look at the shareholders of Amplify Energy Corp. ( NYSE:AMPY ) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 49% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk). Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Amplify Energy. See our latest analysis for Amplify Energy NYSE:AMPY Ownership Breakdown December 19th 2024 What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Amplify Energy? Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. Amplify Energy already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Amplify Energy's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. NYSE:AMPY Earnings and Revenue Growth December 19th 2024 Hedge funds don't have many shares in Amplify Energy. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 7.0% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are The Vanguard Group, Inc. and Stoney Lonesome Hf Lp, with an equal amount of shares to their name at 6.4%. On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. Story Continues Insider Ownership Of Amplify Energy The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Amplify Energy Corp.. It has a market capitalization of just US$243m, and insiders have US$6.1m worth of shares, in their own names. It is good to see some investment by insiders, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public Ownership The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 42% stake in Amplify Energy. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders. Private Company Ownership It seems that Private Companies own 6.3%, of the Amplify Energy stock. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual.

(AMPY): A Bull Case Theory Ricardo Pillai Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 1:00 AM 3 min read In This Article: AMPY -2.25% We came across a bullish thesis on Amplify Energy Corp. (AMPY) on Substack by Idea Hive. In this article, we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on AMPY. Amplify Energy Corp. (AMPY)'s stock was trading at $6.74 as of Nov 12 th . AMPY\u2019s trailing and forward P/E were 4.35 and 5.48 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A drilling rig fueled by the energy and expertise of the oil & gas exploration and production company. Amplify Energy (AMPY) continues to present a compelling investment opportunity within the energy sector, trading at undemanding multiples of approximately 4x 2024E EBITDA and 8x FCF. These multiples reflect the company\u2019s solid cash generation from its low-decline, long-reserve-life oil and gas assets, especially as it ramps up development at its Beta oilfield. The Beta development is particularly promising, with the potential for substantial value creation as AMPY drills new wells and further expands its output. Recently, AMPY reported positive progress on this front, with the second well drilled in Q2 exceeding expectations, achieving production rates of 500 bpd, well above the company\u2019s initial guidance. The third well drilled in Q3 also produced impressive results, with a 30-day production rate of 590 bpd, significantly higher than the initial forecast of 350 bpd. The well\u2019s capital expenditure was in line with projections, and management expects it to pay out within 6 to 9 months, highlighting the strong economics of the Beta asset. With a new well expected to come online in mid-November, AMPY\u2019s ability to scale the Beta development looks promising, with further updates expected in Q1 2025. Operationally, AMPY delivered another strong quarter, maintaining steady production and ample free cash flow. However, the company\u2019s decision to retain its Bairoil asset, after evaluating various proposals, reflects the challenges in the crude oil market and the volatility in pricing. While a divestiture would have been ideal for reducing debt and potentially initiating a large capital return, AMPY\u2019s management has indicated that they are open to future transactions if market conditions improve. Despite this setback, AMPY remains focused on its core assets, particularly Beta, which is key to its growth. From a valuation perspective, AMPY\u2019s stock remains attractive. The market currently ascribes minimal value to the Beta asset, pricing it at around $66 million based on current multiples. However, given the successful drilling results and strong cash flow potential of Beta, this figure seems conservative. In fact, modeling Beta\u2019s potential cash flow generation, including a more optimistic production scenario, suggests that the asset could generate up to $280 million in free cash flow over the next four years, potentially representing 70% of AMPY\u2019s current enterprise value. As the market becomes more aware of Beta\u2019s value, AMPY is likely to experience a re-rating, particularly as management updates its reserve figures by year-end. Given the continued success of Beta and the company\u2019s overall solid performance, AMPY remains an attractive investment. Story Continues Amplify Energy Corp.

Announces Third Quarter 2024 Results, Beta Drilling Results and Issuance of Sustainability Report Amplify Energy Corp. Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 12:05 AM 25 min read In this article: AMPY -2.25% Amplify Energy Corp. HOUSTON, Nov. 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amplify Energy Corp. (NYSE: AMPY) (\u201cAmplify,\u201d the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) announced today its operating and financial results for the third quarter of 2024. Key Highlights During the third quarter of 2024, the Company: Achieved average total production of 19.0 MBoepd Generated net cash provided by operating activities of $15.7 million and net income of $22.7 million Delivered Adjusted EBITDA of $25.5 million Generated $3.6 million of free cash flow Drilled and completed the C59 development well at Beta, achieving an IP30 oil rate of approximately 590 Bopd (gross), which exceeded Company projections In the process of completing the C48 development well at Beta, which the Company expects to bring online in mid-November On October 25, 2024, the Company completed its semi-annual borrowing base redetermination The borrowing base and elected commitments are now $145.0 million, increasing Amplify\u2019s liquidity by $10.0 million As of September 30, 2024, Amplify had $120.0 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility Net Debt to Last Twelve Months (\u201cLTM\u201d) Adjusted EBITDA of 1.1x 1 The Company issued its annual sustainability report which is now available on its website (1) Net debt as of September 30, 2024, consisting of $120 MM outstanding under its revolving credit facility with ~$0.0 MM of cash and cash equivalents, and LTM Adjusted EBITDA as of the third quarter of 2024 Martyn Willsher, Amplify\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \u201cAmplify continued to deliver strong operating and financial performance in the third quarter. We are excited about the tremendous progress and results of our development program at Beta, where we successfully drilled and completed the C59 well in early October. The well\u2019s 30-day IP rate of 590 gross barrels of oil per day exceeded projections, and based on early results and current commodity prices, we expect it will pay out in six to nine months. We are also in the process of completing the C48 well, and we are excited to see how it will perform. Having successfully drilled wells from both the Ellen and Eureka platforms, we are increasingly confident about the future inventory and development plan for Beta.\u201d \u201cAs discussed in our prior earnings release, we evaluated several proposals regarding the monetization of our Wyoming assets. While we were initially encouraged by the interest we received, in the current commodity price environment, we believe retaining the assets and continuing to benefit from the asset cash flows maximize shareholder value at this time. We remain open to exploring future monetization opportunities as they develop.\u201d Story continues Mr. Willsher concluded, \u201cSo far, 2024 has been a strong year for Amplify. Our base assets are performing well, and we have made significant progress in demonstrating the upside potential of the Beta field. We look forward to continuing the successes of our development program at Beta and remain confident that the initiatives we are actively pursuing this year will be transformative for the Company.\u201d Key Financial Results During the third quarter of 2024, the Company reported net income of approximately $22.7 million compared to net income of $7.1 million in the prior quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to a non-cash unrealized gain on commodity derivatives during the period compared to an unrealized loss in the prior period. Amplify generated $25.5 million of Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter, a decrease of approximately $5.2 million from $30.7 million in the prior quarter. Second quarter Adjusted EBITDA benefited from a one-time $7.0 million accounting adjustment related to the release of suspense from prior quarters. Further detail on the adjustment can be found at the end of this release and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Free cash flow was $3.6 million for the third quarter, a decrease of $5.6 million compared to the prior quarter, which was also impacted by the second quarter suspense release. Amplify has now generated positive free cash flow in 17 of the last 18 fiscal quarters. Third Quarter Second Quarter $ in millions 2024 2024 Net income (loss) $22.7 $7.1 Net cash provided by operating activities $15.7 $15.4 Average daily production (MBoe/d) 19.0 20.3 Total revenues excluding hedges $69.9 $79.5 Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) $25.5 $30.7 Total capital $18.2 $18.0 Free Cash Flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) $3.6 $9.2 Revolving Credit Facility On October 25, 2024, Amplify completed the regularly scheduled semi-annual redetermination of its borrowing base. The borrowing base was reduced $5.0 million while elected commitments were increased $10.0 million, bringing the borrowing base and elected commitments under the revolving credit facility to $145.0 million. The next regularly scheduled borrowing base redetermination is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2025. As of September 30, 2024, Amplify had $120.0 million outstanding under its revolving credit facility, and net debt to LTM Adjusted EBITDA was 1.1x (net debt as of September 30, 2024 and 3Q24 LTM Adjusted EBITDA). Third quarter net debt increased slightly from the prior quarter due to expected changes in working capital and increased development activity, primarily at Beta. The Company\u2019s net debt to LTM Adjusted EBITDA ratio improved quarter-over-quarter to 1.1x from 1.2x due to increased LTM Adjusted EBITDA. Sustainability Report Update The Company issued its second annual sustainability report, which is available on its website, www.amplifyenergy.com, under the \u201cSustainability\u201d tab. The report provides updated information about Amplify\u2019s environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) initiatives, practices and related metrics. Corporate Production and Pricing During the third quarter of 2024, average daily production was approximately 19.0 Mboepd, a decrease of 1.3 Mboepd from the prior quarter. The second quarter benefitted from a one-time, prior-period accounting adjustment, which added approximately 1.2 Mboepd. Adjusting for the one-time benefit in the second quarter, third quarter production was relatively flat compared to the prior quarter despite a planned multi-day shut-in at Beta for the electrification and emissions reductions project and the C59 well coming online just after quarter-end. The Company\u2019s product mix for the quarter was 43% crude oil, 17% NGLs, and 40% natural gas.

The Company realized a net gain on commodity derivatives of $6.4 million during the third quarter. Oil, natural gas and NGL revenues, net of realized hedges, decreased $1.5 million for the third quarter compared to the prior quarter. The following table sets forth information regarding average realized sales prices for the periods indicated: Crude Oil ($/Bbl) NGLs ($/Bbl) Natural Gas ($/Mcf) Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 Average sales price exclusive of realized derivatives and certain deductions from revenue $ 71.74 $ 76.51 $ 21.63 $ 20.05 $ 1.84 $ 1.78 Realized derivatives (0.24 ) (3.17 ) - - 1.38 1.36 Average sales price with realized derivatives exclusive of certain deductions from revenue $ 71.50 $ 73.34 $ 21.63 $ 20.05 $ 3.22 $ 3.14 Certain deductions from revenue - - (1.33 ) (1.06 ) 0.00 0.02 Average sales price inclusive of realized derivatives and certain deductions from revenue $ 71.50 $ 73.34 $ 20.30 $ 18.99 $ 3.22 $ 3.16 Costs and Expenses Lease operating expenses in the third quarter of 2024 were approximately $33.3 million, or $18.98 per Boe, a $3.0 million decrease compared to the prior quarter. Approximately $1.2 million of this decrease was due to a reclassification of certain expenses to taxes other than income with the remaining decrease attributable to continued optimization initiatives. Lease operating expenses also do not reflect $0.8 million of income generated by Magnify Energy Services in the third quarter. Severance and ad valorem taxes in the third quarter were approximately $6.0 million, an increase of $1.4 million compared to $4.6 million in the prior quarter primarily due to the reclassification of certain lease operating expenses, as noted above. Severance and ad valorem taxes as a percentage of revenue were approximately 8.8% this quarter compared to 6.4% in the prior quarter due to this adjustment. The Company anticipates that taxes as a percentage of revenue will remain within its previously announced guidance range for 2024. Amplify incurred $4.3 million, or $2.45 per Boe, of gathering, processing and transportation expenses in the third quarter, compared to $4.9 million, or $2.66 per Boe, in the prior quarter. Third quarter cash G&A expenses were $6.2 million, a decrease of $0.4 million from the prior quarter and in-line with expectations. This decrease was primarily due to lower legal fees. The Company expects quarterly cash G&A expenses will remain at approximately this same level in the fourth quarter. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the third quarter totaled $8.1 million, or $4.62 per Boe, compared to $7.8 million, or $4.25 per Boe, in the prior quarter. Net interest expense was $3.8 million for the third quarter, an increase of $0.2 million from $3.6 million in the prior quarter. Amplify recorded a current income tax expense of $0.4 million for the third quarter. Capital Investments Cash capital investment during the third quarter of 2024 was approximately $18.2 million. During the third quarter, the Company\u2019s capital allocation was approximately 66% for Beta development drilling and facility projects, with the remainder distributed across the Company\u2019s other assets. The following table details Amplify\u2019s capital invested during the third quarter of 2024: Third Quarter Year to Date 2024 Capital 2024 Capital ($ MM) ($ MM) Bairoil $ 1.2 $ 2.7 Beta $ 12.0 $ 43.7 Oklahoma $ 1.5 $ 3.0 East Texas / North Louisiana $ 2.3 $ 2.9 Eagle Ford (Non-op) $ 1.2 $ 2.0 Magnify Energy Services $ 0.0 $ 1.0 Total Capital Invested $ 18.2 $ 55.3 In the fourth quarter of 2024, Amplify expects its capital investments will be allocated primarily to the drilling of the C48 development well and its participation in non-operated drilling opportunities in East Texas and the Eagle Ford. Due to the acceleration of non-operated development costs in the fourth quarter, Amplify expects total capital to be at or slightly above the high end of its current annual guidance range of $60 to $65 million. Beta Development and Facility Upgrade Update In the third quarter, the Company invested approximately $5.9 million to successfully drill the C59 well from the Eureka platform, which was brought online in early October and achieved an IP-30 oil rate of approximately 590 Bopd. The C48 well is in the process of being completed and is expected to come online in mid-November. In 2024, the Company completed two wells with better-than-anticipated results and short projected payback periods on its investment and is the process of completing its third well. The Company is refining its long-term development plans at Beta based on these initial successes and anticipates communicating these plans in the first quarter of 2025. During the third quarter, the Company continued the final phase of the electrification and emissions reduction project at Beta, which involves installing selective catalytic reducers on the platform generators and rig engines. This multi-year facility project is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024. Hedging Recently, the Company took advantage of volatility in the futures market to add to its hedge position, further protecting future cash flows. Amplify executed crude oil swaps for 2025 and 2026 at a weighted-average price of $69.39 per barrel and $68.12 per barrel, respectively, while monetizing a small portion of in-the-money gas hedges to stay in compliance with the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility.

Amplify\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate such measures in the same manner as Amplify does. Adjusted EBITDA . Amplify defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus Interest expense; Income tax expense (benefit); DD&A; Impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets (including oil and natural gas properties); Accretion of AROs; Loss or (gain) on commodity derivative instruments; Cash settlements received or (paid) on expired commodity derivative instruments; Amortization of gain associated with terminated commodity derivatives; Losses or (gains) on sale of assets and other, net; Share-based compensation expenses; Exploration costs; Acquisition and divestiture related expenses; Reorganization items, net; Severance payments; and Other non-routine items that we deem appropriate. Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used as a supplemental financial measure by management and external users of Amplify\u2019s financial statements, such as investors, research analysts and rating agencies, to assess: (1) its operating performance as compared to other companies in Amplify\u2019s industry without regard to financing methods, capital structures or historical cost basis; (2) the ability of its assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest and support Amplify\u2019s indebtedness; and (3) the viability of projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities. Since Adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income or loss and because these measures may vary among other companies, the Adjusted EBITDA data presented in this press release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow . Amplify defines free cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA, less cash interest expense and capital expenditures. Free cash flow is an important non-GAAP financial measure for Amplify\u2019s investors since it serves as an indicator of the Company\u2019s success in providing a cash return on investment. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to free cash flow are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Net debt . Amplify defines net debt as the total principal amount drawn on the revolving credit facility less cash and cash equivalents. The Company uses net debt as a measure of financial position and believes this measure provides useful additional information to investors to evaluate the Company's capital structure and financial leverage. Cash G&A . Amplify defines cash G&A as general and administrative expense, less share-based compensation expense; acquisition and divestiture costs; bad debt expense; and severance payments. Cash G&A is an important non-GAAP financial measure for Amplify\u2019s investors since it allows for analysis of G&A spend without regard to share-based compensation and other non-recurring expenses which can vary substantially from company to company. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to cash G&A is total G&A expenses.
