[{"text": "First Watch Restaurant Group Inc. (FWRG): Among the High Growth Restaurant Stocks for 2025 Jabran Kundi Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 6:13 PM 3 min read In This Article: FWRG -0.14% We recently compiled a list of the 10 High Growth Restaurant Stocks For 2025 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where First Watch Restaurant Group Inc. (NASDAQ:FWRG) stands against the other high growth restaurant stocks. Morgan Stanley recently published a report on the restaurant industry, suggesting that the tough environment that the industry is currently facing may ease out in 2025, though only modestly. Restaurants will have to continue working on providing value meals to consumers who continue to struggle to balance their income and expenses. A balanced job market could help keep labor costs steady. However, a political campaign against immigration could be a potential headwind for the industry. A growing emphasis on robotics to improve efficiency and customer service could also play a key role in the industry\u2019s development this year, though it is too early to determine the financial implications of these moves. We decided to shortlist a few stocks that we believe could benefit from an improving industry environment in 2025. To come up with the list of 10 restaurant stocks with a high growth rate, we only considered stocks that have grown by more than 15% in the last 5 years or since IPO and have a market cap of at least $1 billion. A busy restaurant kitchen with a chef carefully plating a meal. First Watch Restaurant Group Inc. (NASDAQ:FWRG) First Watch Restaurant Group Inc. runs a daytime-only restaurant chain under the First Watch Trade name and serves brunch, lunch, and breakfast. Its stock is down 10% for the year and currently trading below its IPO price. This could change once the company resolves its traffic problem, which isn\u2019t entirely of its own making. It is an industry-wide issue expected to ease in 2025. The growth rate of 24% may not be sustainable for FWRG but this doesn\u2019t undermine the company\u2019s growth story in any way. This month, the company announced that it had achieved its target of 25 new store openings in Q4, despite minor delays at some locations. More openings are expected this year as the CEO Chris Tomasso updated the company\u2019s shareholders: In 2025, we plan to build on our leading position in the Daytime Dining category through a robust real estate pipeline and with our talented team committed to driving our long-term growth strategy. Overall FWRG ranks 5th on our list of the high growth restaurant stocks for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of FWRG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as FWRG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock .

Restaurant Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:FWRG) Shares Could Be 32% Above Their Intrinsic Value Estimate editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 1:35 PM 6 min read In This Article: FWRG -0.14% Key Insights Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, First Watch Restaurant Group fair value estimate is US$14.16 Current share price of US$18.74 suggests First Watch Restaurant Group is potentially 32% overvalued Analyst price target for FWRG is US$23.82, which is 68% above our fair value estimate Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of First Watch Restaurant Group, Inc. ( NASDAQ:FWRG ) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow. Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model . Check out our latest analysis for First Watch Restaurant Group Step By Step Through The Calculation We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$18.7m US$30.9m US$36.5m US$51.0m US$58.8m US$64.7m US$69.8m US$74.1m US$78.0m US$81.4m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x2 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 10.03% Est @ 7.81% Est @ 6.25% Est @ 5.16% Est @ 4.40% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.9% -US$17.2 US$26.0 US$28.2 US$36.2 US$38.3 US$38.7 US$38.3 US$37.4 US$36.1 US$34.6 (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$297m We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.6%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.9%. Story Continues Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$81m\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (8.9%\u2013 2.6%) = US$1.3b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = US$1.3b\u00f7 ( 1 + 8.9%) 10 = US$561m The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$858m. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$18.7, the company appears potentially overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. NasdaqGS:FWRG Discounted Cash Flow January 14th 2025 Important Assumptions The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at First Watch Restaurant Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.535. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for First Watch Restaurant Group Strength Debt is not viewed as a risk. Weakness Earnings declined over the past year. Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market. Threat Revenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year. Moving On: Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Jemley will work closely with the LANDED executive team to guide strategic growth as the company expands. LANDED's logo. LANDED is the definitive end-to-end generative AI solution for high volume hiring. (PRNewsfoto/LANDED) Jemley, who retired in May as the CFO of Dutch Bros Coffee, brings over three decades of experience in multinational retail and a wealth of C-level experience to the role. Known for his expertise with high growth businesses after long careers at both Yum! Brands and Starbucks, recently Charley played a pivotal role in Dutch Bros Coffee's (NYSE: BROS) successful 2021 IPO and in its first years as a public company. His career is deeply rooted in global perspectives, having served as the CFO of Yum! Brands (NYSE: YUM) China and as the CFO of Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) China business, and ultimately Starbucks' overall International business. He currently serves as a Strategic Advisor to Dutch Bros Coffee, and as an independent director at both Four Corners Property Trust (NYSE: FCPT) and First Watch Restaurant Group (NASDAQ: FWRG), where he chairs the Audit Committee for both companies. Vivian Wang , Founder and CEO of LANDED, said, \"I'm thrilled to welcome Charley to LANDED's advisory board. His extensive industry expertise will be instrumental in shaping our strategic direction and enhancing the value we deliver to our customers. His passion for supporting frontline workers deeply aligns with my vision for LANDED, and I look forward to the impact this partnership will have on our mission. With Charley on board, exponential growth is an inevitability.\" \"From my first conversations with Vivian, learning about her vision for Landed, I felt an immediate connection to the passion LANDED has for providing 360\u00b0 livelihood support to frontline workers. Vivian has a clear vision for how LANDED can make the partnership between employees and employers more effective and nothing will stop her from making that a reality. Having spent the past many decades in the restaurant business, I have seen firsthand how far too often it is the case that frontline workers are not provided the tools necessary to achieve their personal and financial goals. LANDED provides a foundation for these individuals to take charge of their lives and I felt compelled to get involved,\" said Jemley. \"At the core of every retail business is its ability to find and retain the right talent, and I firmly believe that LANDED is the key to hiring more effectively and more efficiently. The support that LANDED provides operators is an asset to any business, and LANDED is revolutionizing the relationship between employers and employees from start to finish. I am excited to be on this journey with Vivian and the LANDED team, and I know we're going to take the industry by storm.\" Story Continues LANDED's hiring solution saves managers time and money by leveraging advanced generative AI to automate routine tasks. After signing up for the LANDED employer platform, hiring managers can customize their job searches by role, headcount, pay rate, and location. Using a proprietary intelligent matching algorithm, LANDED sources and matches top-quality candidates for each position. This automation allows managers to focus on what they love about their jobs instead of manually sourcing, vetting, engaging, and scheduling interviews for hundreds of candidates. With a long-term goal of providing holistic support for hourly workers, job seekers can also use the LANDED platform to find positions that best meet their needs. The LANDED candidate profile, which includes details on work experience, location, and shift availability, helps applicants connect with jobs that fit them well. LANDED is also developing new services to support financial wellness for frontline workers, including fair and transparent financial products. Over the past two years, LANDED has attracted over 1.7 million frontline workers and hundreds of top employers to its platform, including Erewhon, KFC, Five Guys, Another Broken Egg Cafe, and Tao Group Hospitality. Quickly cementing their status as a celebrated hiring partner, LANDED was the recipient of Inc.'s 2024 Power Partner Award , MURTEC's 2023 Technology Alley Award , and was featured in Gartner's 2024 Hype Cycle for Talent Acquisition Report as a recommended vendor for high volume hiring industries.

-0.14% 3 Reasons to Sell FWRG and 1 Stock to Buy Instead First Watch trades at $19.33 and has moved in lockstep with the market. Its shares have returned 5.9% over the last six months while the S&P 500 has gained 10.4%. Is now the time to buy First Watch, or should you be careful about including it in your portfolio? Dive into our full research report to see our analyst team\u2019s opinion, it\u2019s free . We're swiping left on First Watch for now. Here are three reasons why we avoid FWRG and a stock we'd rather own. Why Is First Watch Not Exciting? Based on a nautical reference to the first work shift aboard a ship, First Watch (NASDAQ:FWRG) is a chain of breakfast and brunch restaurants whose menu is heavily-focused on eggs and griddle items such as pancakes. 1. Breakeven Free Cash Flow Limits Reinvestment Potential Free cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king. First Watch broke even from a free cash flow perspective over the last two years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. First Watch Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin 2. Previous Growth Initiatives Haven\u2019t Paid Off Yet Growth gives us insight into a company\u2019s long-term potential, but how capital-efficient was that growth? Enter ROIC, a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity). First Watch historically did a mediocre job investing in profitable growth initiatives. Its five-year average ROIC was 2.2%, lower than the typical cost of capital (how much it costs to raise money) for restaurant companies. 3. Short Cash Runway Exposes Shareholders to Potential Dilution As long-term investors, the risk we care about most is the permanent loss of capital, which can happen when a company goes bankrupt or raises money from a disadvantaged position. This is separate from short-term stock price volatility, something we are much less bothered by. First Watch burned through $3.99 million of cash over the last year, and its $779.3 million of debt exceeds the $51.13 million of cash on its balance sheet. This is a deal breaker for us because indebted loss-making companies spell trouble. First Watch Net Cash Position Unless the First Watch\u2019s fundamentals change quickly, it might find itself in a position where it must raise capital from investors to continue operating. Whether that would be favorable is unclear because dilution is a headwind for shareholder returns. We remain cautious of First Watch until it generates consistent free cash flow or any of its announced financing plans materialize on its balance sheet. Story Continues Final Judgment First Watch isn\u2019t a terrible business, but it doesn\u2019t pass our quality test. That said, the stock currently trades at 50.5\u00d7 forward price-to-earnings (or $19.33 per share). This multiple tells us a lot of good news is priced in - we think there are better opportunities elsewhere. We\u2019d suggest looking at MercadoLibre, the Amazon and PayPal of Latin America . Stocks We Like More Than First Watch The Trump trade may have passed, but rates are still dropping and inflation is still cooling.

NasdaqGS:FWRG Earnings and Revenue Growth December 9th 2024 Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares.

It seems like the market has already priced in FWRG\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value? Are you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on FWRG, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value.

16 Franchise Restaurants Zacks Equity Research Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 7:13 PM 3 min read In This Article: FWRG -0.14% First Watch Restaurant Group, Inc. FWRG has entered into an agreement to acquire 15 franchise-owned locations and one restaurant under construction in North and South Carolina for a total of $49 million. The transaction is expected to close by mid-April 2025, subject to customary closing conditions, and will be funded with a combination of cash and borrowings from the company\u2019s credit facility. The company views strategic acquisitions of franchise-operated restaurants as a key component of its long-term growth and value-creation strategy. The addition of these 16 restaurants and its development rights will strengthen First Watch Restaurant\u2019s corporate presence in the East Coast. This acquisition is part of First Watch Restaurant\u2019s ongoing expansion strategy. Since May 2023, the company has acquired 45 franchised restaurants through six transactions, significantly increasing its presence across key markets. The company\u2019s continued expansion highlights its strong growth in the daytime dining sector. This move will also open up new territories for organic growth in the future. First Watch Restaurant expects these restaurants to perform at levels similar to its company-owned locations, generating strong unit volumes and restaurant-level operating profit margins. Shares of FWRG moved up 1.7% and 1.2% during yesterday\u2019s trading session and after-hours, respectively. FWRG Expands Presence With Franchise Acquisition Investors looking for opportunities in the restaurant sector should pay attention to FWRG's strategic acquisitions, as these position the company for long-term growth and value generation in a competitive market. On April 15, 2024, the company completed the acquisition of 21 franchise-owned restaurants in North Carolina for $75 million. This transaction supports First Watch Restaurant\u2019s strategy to strengthen its market presence and drive continued growth. In the third quarter of 2024, the company opened nine new system-wide restaurants across eight states. This brings the total number of system-wide restaurants to 547, including 466 company-owned and 81 franchise-owned locations, as of Sept. 29, 2024, across 29 states.

Revenue Estimates Breakfast restaurant chain First Watch Restaurant Group (NASDAQ:FWRG) missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q3 CY2024, but sales rose 14.8% year on year to $251.6 million. Its GAAP profit of $0.03 per share was also 36.3% below analysts\u2019 consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy First Watch? Find out in our full research report . First Watch (FWRG) Q3 CY2024 Highlights: Revenue: $251.6 million vs analyst estimates of $256.6 million (2% miss) EPS: $0.03 vs analyst expectations of $0.05 (36.3% miss) EBITDA: $25.62 million vs analyst estimates of $24.38 million (5.1% beat) EBITDA guidance for the full year is $111 million at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $108.6 million Gross Margin (GAAP): 20.7%, in line with the same quarter last year Operating Margin: 2.5%, down from 3.5% in the same quarter last year EBITDA Margin: 10.2%, in line with the same quarter last year Locations: 547 at quarter end, up from 505 in the same quarter last year Same-Store Sales fell 1.9% year on year (4.8% in the same quarter last year) Market Capitalization: $1.10 billion \u201cWe are pleased with our performance in Q3 as it reflects our teams\u2019 superb restaurant-level operations, especially considering an uneven consumer backdrop. Traffic picked up through the quarter, our employee turnover once again improved and remains favorable relative to the industry as a whole and Adjusted EBITDA grew 18%,\u201d said Chris Tomasso, First Watch CEO and President. Company Overview Based on a nautical reference to the first work shift aboard a ship, First Watch (NASDAQ:FWRG) is a chain of breakfast and brunch restaurants whose menu is heavily-focused on eggs and griddle items such as pancakes. Sit-Down Dining Sit-down restaurants offer a complete dining experience with table service. These establishments span various cuisines and are renowned for their warm hospitality and welcoming ambiance, making them perfect for family gatherings, special occasions, or simply unwinding. Their extensive menus range from appetizers to indulgent desserts and wines and cocktails. This space is extremely fragmented and competition includes everything from publicly-traded companies owning multiple chains to single-location mom-and-pop restaurants. Sales Growth A company\u2019s long-term performance can indicate its business quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. First Watch is a mid-sized restaurant chain, which sometimes brings disadvantages compared to larger competitors benefiting from better brand awareness and economies of scale. On the other hand, it has an edge over smaller competitors with fewer resources and can still flex high growth rates because it\u2019s working from a smaller revenue base. Story Continues As you can see below, First Watch\u2019s 18.5% annualized revenue growth over the last five years (we compare to 2019 to normalize for COVID-19 impacts) was excellent as it opened new restaurants and increased sales at existing, established dining locations. First Watch Total Revenue This quarter, First Watch\u2019s revenue grew 14.8% year on year to $251.6 million, falling short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 13.7% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last five years. This projection is still commendable and shows the market is baking in success for its offerings. Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

Restaurant Performance Number of Restaurants A restaurant chain\u2019s total number of dining locations often determines how much revenue it can generate. First Watch operated 547 locations in the latest quarter. It has opened new restaurants at a rapid clip over the last two years and averaged 9.5% annual growth, much faster than the broader restaurant sector. This gives it a chance to become a large, scaled business over time. When a chain opens new restaurants, it usually means it\u2019s investing for growth because there\u2019s healthy demand for its meals and there are markets where the concept has few or no locations. First Watch Operating Locations Same-Store Sales A company's restaurant base only paints one part of the picture. When demand is high, it makes sense to open more. But when demand is low, it\u2019s prudent to close some locations and use the money in other ways. Same-store sales is an industry measure of whether revenue is growing at those existing restaurants and is driven by customer visits (often called traffic) and the average spending per customer (ticket). First Watch has been one of the most successful restaurant chains over the last two years thanks to skyrocketing demand within its existing dining locations. On average, the company has posted exceptional year-on-year same-store sales growth of 4.6%. This performance suggests its rollout of new restaurants is beneficial for shareholders. We like this backdrop because it gives First Watch multiple ways to win: revenue growth can come from new restaurants or increased foot traffic and higher sales per customer at existing locations. First Watch Same-Store Sales Growth In the latest quarter, First Watch\u2019s same-store sales fell by 1.9% annually. This decline was a reversal from the 4.8% year-on-year increase it posted 12 months ago. We\u2019ll keep a close eye on the company to see if this turns into a longer-term trend. Key Takeaways from First Watch\u2019s Q3 Results We enjoyed seeing First Watch exceed analysts\u2019 EBITDA expectations this quarter. We were also glad its full-year EBITDA guidance exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates. On the other hand, its revenue and EPS missed. Overall, this was a mixed quarter. The stock traded down 1.6% to $17.95 immediately after reporting. First Watch\u2019s latest earnings report disappointed. One quarter doesn\u2019t define a company\u2019s quality, so let\u2019s explore whether the stock is a buy at the current price. If you\u2019re making that decision, you should consider the bigger picture of valuation, business qualities, as well as the latest earnings.

Market Update As expected, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 25bps (a quarter of a percent) in November 2024 after Donald Trump triumphed in the US Presidential election. This marks the central bank's second easing of monetary policy after a large 50bps rate cut two months earlier. Going forward, the markets will debate whether these rate cuts (and more potential ones in 2025) are perfect timing to support the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much. Adding to the degree of difficulty is a new Republican administration that could make large changes to corporate taxes and prior efforts such as the Inflation Reduction Act.

(NASDAQ: FWRG) ( \u201c First Watch\u201d or the \u201c Company\u201d), the leading Daytime Dining concept serving breakfast, brunch and lunch, today reported financial results for the thirteen weeks ended September\u00a029, 2024 (\u201cQ3 2024\u201d). \u201cWe are pleased with our performance in Q3 as it reflects our teams\u2019 superb restaurant-level operations, especially considering an uneven consumer backdrop. Traffic picked up through the quarter, our employee turnover once again improved and remains favorable relative to the industry as a whole and Adjusted EBITDA grew 18%,\u201d said Chris Tomasso, First Watch CEO and President. \u201cWe are committed to ensuring our people and real estate pipelines are in place to support our growth to 2,200 locations.\u201d Highlights: Total revenues increased 14.8% to $251.6 million in Q3 2024 from $219.2 million in Q3 2023 System-wide sales increased 8.0% to $291.8 million in Q3 2024 from $270.3 million in Q3 2023 Same-restaurant sales growth of negative 1.9% and same-restaurant traffic growth of negative 4.4%* Income from operations margin decreased to 2.5% in Q3 2024 from 3.6% in Q3 2023 Restaurant level operating profit margin** increased to 18.9% in Q3 2024 from 18.7% in Q3 2023 Net income decreased to $2.1 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in Q3 2024 from $5.4 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, in Q3 2023 Adjusted EBITDA** increased to $25.6 million in Q3 2024 from $21.6 million in Q3 2023 Opened 9 system-wide restaurants in 8 states, resulting in a total of 547 system-wide restaurants (466 company-owned and 81 franchise-owned) across 29 states Update regarding Hurricane Milton: All company-owned First Watch restaurants were fully operational shortly after Hurricane Milton and, as such, the storm is not expected to have a material impact on same-restaurant sales in the fourth quarter. As a result of associated construction-related disruptions, five company-owned new restaurant openings, previously expected in December 2024, have been rescheduled to January 2025. The Company experienced no check management in the third quarter, though planned, targeted marketing campaigns had a small impact on net per person average. ___________________ * Comparing the thirteen-week periods ended September\u00a029, 2024 and October\u00a01, 2023 in order to compare like-for-like periods. See \u201cKey Performance Indicators\u201d for additional information. ** See Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliations section below. Story Continues For additional financial information related to the thirteen weeks ended September\u00a029, 2024, refer to the Company\u2019s quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November\u00a07, 2024, which can be accessed at https://investors.firstwatch.com in the Financials & Filings section. Updated Outlook Fiscal Year 2024 Based upon third quarter results and current trends, the Company updated the following guidance metrics for the 52-week fiscal year ending December 29, 2024: Same-restaurant sales growth of around negative 1.0% with same restaurant traffic growth of negative 4.0%-4.5% Total revenue growth in the range of 16.5% to 17.0% (1) Adjusted EBITDA (2) in the range of $110.0 million to $112.0 million (1) Total new system-wide restaurant openings anticipated to be 47, net of 2 company-owned restaurant closures (43 new company-owned restaurants and 6 new franchise-owned restaurants), which reflects the effect of five new restaurant openings delayed by Hurricane Milton and rescheduled to early 2025. Blended tax rate of around 33.0% Capital expenditures of around $130.0 million invested primarily in new restaurant projects and planned remodels (3) ______________________ (1) Includes net impact of approximately 7.0% in total revenue growth and approximately $14.0 million in Adjusted EBITDA associated with completed acquisitions. (2) We have not reconciled guidance for Adjusted EBITDA to the corresponding GAAP financial measure because we do not provide guidance for the various reconciling items. We are unable to provide guidance for these reconciling items because we cannot determine their probable significance, as certain items are outside of our control and cannot be reasonably predicted due to the fact that these items could vary significantly from period to period. Accordingly, a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measure is not available without unreasonable effort. (3) Does not include the capital outlays associated with the acquisition of franchise-owned restaurants. Conference Call and Webcast Chris Tomasso, Chief Executive Officer and President, and Mel Hope, Chief Financial Officer, will host a conference call and webcast to discuss these financial results for Q3 2024 on November 7, 2024 at 8:00 AM ET.

Marotta 941-500-1918 investors@firstwatch.com Media Relations Contact Jenni Glester 407-864-5823 jglester@firstwatch.com Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited) To supplement the consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d), we use the following non-GAAP measures, which present operating results on an adjusted basis: (i) Adjusted EBITDA, (ii) Adjusted EBITDA margin, (iii) Restaurant level operating profit and (iv) Restaurant level operating profit margin. Our presentation of these non-GAAP measures includes isolating the effects of some items that are either nonrecurring in nature or vary from period to period without any correlation to our ongoing core operating performance. These supplemental measures of performance are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional visibility into our operations, facilitate analysis and comparisons of our ongoing business operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of our ongoing operating performance, help to identify operational trends and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in our financial and operational decision making. Our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and have important limitations as analytical tools. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP as they may not provide a complete understanding of our performance. These non-GAAP measures should be reviewed in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin (i) as factors in evaluating management\u2019s performance when determining incentive compensation, (ii) to evaluate the Company\u2019s operating results and the effectiveness of our business strategies and (iii) internally as benchmarks to compare the Company\u2019s performance to that of its competitors.

Restaurant level operating profit and Restaurant level operating profit margin Restaurant level operating profit and Restaurant level operating profit margin are not indicative of our overall results, and because they exclude corporate-level expenses, do not accrue directly to the benefit of our stockholders. We will continue to incur such expenses in the future. Restaurant level operating profit and Restaurant level operating profit margin are important measures we use to evaluate the performance and profitability of each operating restaurant, individually and in the aggregate and to make decisions regarding future spending and other operational decisions. We believe that Restaurant level operating profit and Restaurant level operating profit margin provide useful information about our operating results, identify operational trends and allow for transparency with respect to key metrics used by us in our financial and operational decision-making.

Positive Points First Watch Restaurant Group Inc ( NASDAQ:FWRG ) reported strong adjusted EBITDA growth and increased restaurant-level operating profit margin. The company opened nine new system-wide restaurants across eight states, with seven being company-owned. Dining room traffic turned positive towards the end of the quarter, attributed to successful targeted marketing campaigns. First Watch was recognized as the number one most loved workplace in America by Newsweek and the Best Practice Institute. The company's new restaurant openings are outperforming underwriting expectations by roughly 10%, indicating strong site selection and operational execution. Negative Points Same restaurant traffic declined by 4.4% in the third quarter, contributing to negative same restaurant sales of 1.9%. Third-party delivery traffic moved more negative, acting as a drag on consolidated traffic. The company experienced commodity inflation of 3.4%, with bacon, avocados, and eggs being primary drivers. Hurricane-related disruptions impacted construction and led to the rescheduling of some new restaurant openings. Off-premise traffic remains negative, although direct off-premise traffic has stabilized. Q & A Highlights Q : Can you elaborate on the success of your targeted marketing campaigns and their impact on consumer trends? A : Christopher Tomasso, CEO, explained that the targeted marketing campaigns tested in Q3 showed promising results, particularly in improving dining room traffic. The company sees on-premise and off-premise channels as distinct, and while there might be some overlap in tactics, they are specific to each channel. The success of these initiatives is being considered for the overall plan for next year. Q : What are your thoughts on the current softness in the AM daypart and its impact on First Watch? A : Tomasso noted that the morning meal occasion is under pressure due to the macro environment, not because of trade-down to QSR or convenience breakfast. The breakfast occasion is easily replaced at home, but First Watch continues to gain market share. The company is confident that once the consumer environment improves, they will benefit from a resurgence in breakfast and brunch dining. Story Continues Q : How are you addressing the challenges in third-party delivery traffic? A : Tomasso acknowledged that third-party delivery has been a drag on traffic, with mid-10s declines since mid-year. The company is working with partners to optimize their presence and offerings in this channel, but it remains a secondary focus compared to in-restaurant dining and direct off-premise channels. Q : Can you discuss the impact of new restaurant openings on your financial performance? A : Tomasso highlighted that new restaurant openings are outperforming underwriting expectations by about 10%. The company is getting better at selecting sites and optimizing operations, which has led to significant increases in projected average unit volumes. This strategic focus is expected to continue driving growth. Q : What are your plans for technology investments, particularly in marketing? A : Tomasso stated that while First Watch has made significant tech investments in operations, the focus is now shifting to consumer-facing technology, especially in marketing. The company aims to leverage data for more targeted and timely messaging to enhance demand generation efforts.
