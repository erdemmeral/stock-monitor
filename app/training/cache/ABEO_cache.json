news and updates on Trump's tariffs ABEO: FDA Accepts BLA Re-Submission for Pz-cel; PDUFA Date of April 29, 2025; Raising Valuation to $9.50\u2026 Zacks Small Cap Research Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 2:10 PM 5 min read In This Article: ABEO -0.18% By David Bautz, PhD NASDAQ:ABEO READ THE FULL ABEO RESEARCH REPORT Business Update BLA Resubmission Accepted; PDUFA Date of April 29, 2025 On November 12, 2024, Abeona Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABEO) announced that the U.S. FDA has accepted the Biologics License Application (BLA) for prademagene zamikeracel (pz-cel) and set a PDUFA target action date of April 29, 2025. The resubmission of the BLA follows the company receiving a complete response letter (CRL) earlier in 2024 in which the FDA identified the need for additional Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) data pertaining to the validation of certain manufacturing and release testing methods. The company completed a Type A meeting with the FDA in August 2024 where it aligned with the agency on the content necessary for the resubmission of the BLA. The FDA did not identify any deficiencies related to the clinical efficacy or clinical safety data and there were no requests for additional clinical data or any new clinical trials. The acceptance of the resubmission is indicative that the company addressed all the deficiencies noted in the CRL and that the agency now has all the information necessary to fully evaluate the BLA. Abeona was previously informed by the FDA that it does not intend to conduct an Advisory Committee (AdComm) meeting. Lastly, all pre-license inspections of the clinical sites and the company\u2019s manufacturing facility were completed last year and no additional site inspections are anticipated as part of the resubmission process. Pre-Commercialization Activities Continue Now that the BLA resubmission is complete, Abeona is turning its attention to pre-commercialization activities. The launch strategy is relatively straightforward as the company intends to have five EB centers onboarded and trained at the time of launch. These centers will be spread out across the U.S. in an attempt to minimize the travel for RDEB patients as much as possible. The company estimates there are approximately 1,300 dystrophic EB patients being treated in the U.S. Of those, approximately 750 are pz-cel eligible RDEB patients and close to 30% of those patients are concentrated at a small number of EB centers, many of which are being targeted at launch. In order to ensure a smooth and efficient onboarding process for the EB centers, Abeona has been conducting multiple meetings between members of the company and those from the centers, including EB physicians and surgeons, cell therapy coordinators, pharmacy directors, and senior leadership of the hospitals. These types of meetings are expected to continue over the coming months to ensure everyone at each center is fully informed and comfortable with all aspects of the pz-cel treatment. The goal is to begin treating the first patients approximately two to three months post approval. Story Continues Abeona is also working to ensure timely patient access to care. The payer mix for RDEB patients is approximately 60% commercial, 30% Medicaid, and 10% Medicare. The company is continuing to engage with national and regional commercial payers that cover approximately 80% of RDEB commercial patients. Engagement with Medicaid programs will occur in the coming months. In August 2024, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) granted a product-specific procedure code ICD-10-PCS for pz-cel. If pz-cel is approved, the code will allow for efficient and accurate documentation, billing, and analysis of inpatient hospital procedures using pz-cel. The code went into effect on Oct. 1, 2024. In addition, CMS assigned Medicare reimbursement of pz-cel to Pre-Major Diagnostic Category, Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group 018 (Pre-MDC MS-DRG 018), which is among the highest available inpatient hospital reimbursement levels for cell and gene therapies. Financial Update On November 14, 2024, Abeona announced financial results for the third quarter of 2024. The company did not report any revenue in the third quarter of 2024. R&D expenses in the third quarter of 2024 were $8.9 million compared to $7.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased salary and related costs along with increased clinical and development expenses associated with the BLA resubmission. G&A expenses in the third quarter of 2024 were $6.4 million compared to $4.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased salaries, pre-commercial preparation costs, non-cash stock-based compensation, and professional fees. Abeona exited the third quarter of 2024 with approximately $110 million in cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, and restricted cash. We estimate the company now has sufficient capital to fund operations into 2026, which does not take into account any potential revenue from commercial sales of pz-cel, if approved, or proceeds from the sale of a Priority Review Voucher (PRV), if awarded by the FDA. Interestingly, the last two PRVs to sell were for $150 million and $158 million, which is well above the approximately $100 million that PRVs had been selling for during the previous couple of years. However, we don\u2019t believe this trend will continue as it was likely the result of some uncertainty regarding the continuation of the PRV program. We are confident the PRV program will be continued by Congress and that the PRV sales price is likely to continue in the $100 million range. As of November 12, 2024, the company had approximately 43.5 million shares outstanding and, when factoring in stock options and warrants, a fully diluted share count of approximately 57.5 million. Conclusion We believe the acceptance of the resubmission by the FDA is a very good sign that the company has fully addressed all the deficiencies in the CRL and we are very confident that pz-cel will be approved on or before the PDUFA date of April 29, 2025. We are also confident in the management team as it continues pre-commercialization activities to ensure a smooth launch upon approval. During the recent conference call, management stated that $1.5 million per treatment could be a possible floor for pricing of pz-cel. The company has not finalized pricing of pz-cel or come to any conclusion on what the price per treatment will be, however $1.5 million is above what we assumed in our model. Thus, we are adjusting our estimated price per treatment in our valuation model to a conservative $1.2 million (net of rebates), which has resulted in an increase to our valuation to $9.50.

GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with ABEO. Release Date: November 14, 2024 For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript . Positive Points Abeona Therapeutics Inc ( NASDAQ:ABEO ) successfully resubmitted their Biologics License Application (BLA) for prademagene zamikeracel (pz-cel) to the FDA, which was accepted for review with a PDUFA date set for April 29, 2025. The FDA did not request any new clinical trials or data for the approval of pz-cel, indicating confidence in the existing clinical efficacy and safety data. Abeona Therapeutics Inc ( NASDAQ:ABEO ) has secured new patents for pz-cel, extending intellectual property protection until 2040, which underscores the innovative nature of their technology. The company has made significant progress in commercial launch preparations, including building a strong commercialization team and engaging with key treatment centers across the US. Abeona Therapeutics Inc ( NASDAQ:ABEO ) has a solid financial position with $110 million in cash and equivalents, providing sufficient resources to fund operations into 2026. Negative Points The company received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA in April, highlighting the need for additional CMC data, which delayed the approval process. There is a potential supply constraint at launch, as the current manufacturing capacity may not meet the anticipated demand for pz-cel. The company faces competition from existing treatments like Vyjuvek and Filsuvez, which could impact market penetration and adoption of pz-cel. Abeona Therapeutics Inc ( NASDAQ:ABEO ) reported a net loss of $30.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, partly due to a $15.2 million loss from the remeasurement of warrant and derivative liabilities. The expansion of manufacturing capacity involves regulatory reviews and could take 18 to 24 months, potentially limiting the ability to scale up production quickly. Story Continues Q & A Highlights Q : Given the CRL was primarily CMC related, which aspect do you find most concerning going forward? A : Vishwas Seshadri, CEO, explained that the main focus is on identity testing and Stargardt, which were discussed comprehensively with the FDA. Brian Kevany, CTO, added that Stargardt is a significant topic for the FDA, but they are confident in the data and package submitted. Q : How are you strategizing the commercial rollout considering existing treatments like Vyjuvek and Filsuvez? A : Madhav Vasanthavada, CCO, stated that market research shows patients are motivated by pz-cel's wound healing profile. They plan to target high-volume EB centers and leverage patient advocacy and referrals to drive demand. Payer discussions have not shown pushback against pz-cel. Q : How does the favorable Medicare reimbursement designation impact commercial reimbursement plans? A : Madhav Vasanthavada noted that while the Medicare DRG 018 is specific to Medicare patients, it positively reflects on the technology's value to commercial payers. The ICD-10-PCS code will aid seamless hospital billing for commercially insured patients. Q : Can you provide insight into how many patients you could treat commercially by the end of 2025? A : Madhav Vasanthavada mentioned that they aim to treat up to 120 patients annually with current capacity, but plan to expand. Vishwas Seshadri added that they are working on increasing manufacturing capacity, with more clarity expected in future updates. Q : How will you address potential concerns from surgeons about the surgical procedure for pz-cel? A : Vishwas Seshadri assured that surgeons do not see the procedure as complex beyond typical plastic surgery. Madhav Vasanthavada added that cell therapy coordinators are familiar with such procedures, and ongoing trials are building experience.

Thu, Nov 14, 2024, 3:30 PM 8 min read In This Article: ABEO -0.18% Abeona Therapeutics Inc. FDA accepts BLA resubmission of pz-cel in recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa and sets PDUFA target action date of April 29, 2025 Company makes significant progress toward potential commercialization of pz-cel in 2025; Builds momentum with payor discussions and target treatment centers CLEVELAND, Nov. 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Abeona Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: ABEO) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and recent corporate updates. \u201cWith the acceptance of our Biologics License Application (BLA) resubmission for pz-cel, we are ramping up our commercial readiness efforts, especially with respect to onboarding potential pz-cel treatment sites and continuing discussions with payors,\u201d said Vish Seshadri, Chief Executive Officer of Abeona. Third Quarter and Recent Progress Pz-cel for RDEB Abeona completed a Type A meeting in August 2024 where it aligned with the FDA on the content for the resubmission of the Company\u2019s BLA for pz-cel, its investigational first-in-class, autologous cell-based gene therapy currently in development for RDEB, including additional information to satisfy all Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) requirements noted in the Complete Response Letter (CRL) issued in April 2024. The CRL required that certain CMC issues be addressed in the BLA resubmission, and did not identify any deficiencies related to the clinical efficacy or clinical safety data in the BLA. The FDA did not request any new clinical trials or clinical data to support the approval of pz-cel. Also in August 2024, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) granted a product-specific procedure code ICD-10-PCS (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Procedure Coding System) for pz-cel. Also, as part of the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) Final Rule for fiscal year 2025, CMS assigned Medicare reimbursement of pz-cel to Pre-Major Diagnostic Category, Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group 018 (Pre-MDC MS-DRG 018), which is among the highest available inpatient hospital reimbursement levels for cell and gene therapies. The favorable Medicare decisions support efficient hospital billing, reimbursement and patient access. In October 2024, Abeona resubmitted its BLA for pz-cel to the FDA, seeking approval of pz-cel as a potential new treatment for patients with RDEB. Also in October 2024, Abeona entered into a lease agreement for additional facility space in Cleveland, Ohio to enable manufacturing capacity expansion beyond the current planned manufacturing footprint. Also in October 2024, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued a new patent (U.S. Patent No. 12,110,504) (\u201cthe \u2019504 Patent\u201d) and allowed the claims of a second patent (based on U.S. Patent Application No. 16/066,253) that is expected to issue in the coming weeks. Both patents are entitled \u201cGene Therapy for Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Using Genetically Corrected Autologous Keratinocytes,\u201d and include claims that cover the use of pz-cel for the treatment of RDEB. The \u2019504 Patent has an expiration date of January 3, 2037, subject to any applicable patent term extension. In November 2024, the FDA accepted for review the resubmission of Abeona\u2019s pz-cel BLA and set a PDUFA target action date of April 29, 2025. In preparation for potential commercialization, Abeona continues to make progress on several key initiatives, including onboarding high-volume epidermolysis bullosa treatment centers in the U.S. for pz-cel treatment, engaging payers to ensure patient access, and educating key stakeholders. In preparation for potential pz-cel launch, Abeona has hired and trained personnel to support commercialization, manufacturing, supply chain and quality. Story Continues Pipeline and partnered programs In July 2024, Abeona announced a non-exclusive agreement with Beacon Therapeutics, under which Beacon Therapeutics will evaluate Abeona\u2019s patented AAV204 capsid for its potential use in AAV gene therapies for select ophthalmology indications. In October 2024, Ultragenyx participated in a successful pre-BLA meeting with the FDA during which Ultragenyx aligned on the details of its BLA for partnered program UX111 AAV gene therapy for Sanfilippo syndrome type A (MPS IIIA) that is expected to be filed around the end of 2024. Third Quarter Financial Results and Cash Runway Guidance Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash totaled $110.0 million as of September 30, 2024. As of June 30, 2024, cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash totaled $123.0 million. Abeona estimates that its current cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash, as well as its credit facility, are sufficient resources to fund operations into 2026, before accounting for any potential revenue from commercial sales of pz-cel, if approved, or proceeds from the sale of a Priority Review Voucher (PRV), if awarded by the FDA. Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $8.9 million, compared to $7.1 million for the same period of 2023. General and administrative expenses were $6.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $4.2 million for the same period of 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to commercial and launch preparation costs. Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $30.3 million, including a $15.2 million loss resulting from the quarterly remeasurement of the fair value of warrant and derivative liabilities. In the third quarter of 2023, net loss was $11.8 million, including a $1.1 million loss resulting from the quarterly remeasurement of the fair value of warrant liabilities.

Bullosa Abeona Therapeutics Inc. Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 3:30 PM 3 min read In This Article: ABEO -0.18% Abeona Therapeutics Inc. FDA assigns PDUFA target action date of April 29, 2025 CLEVELAND, Nov. 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Abeona Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: ABEO) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review Abeona\u2019s resubmission of its Biologics License Application (BLA) for prademagene zamikeracel (pz-cel), its investigational autologous cell-based gene therapy, as a potential new treatment for recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). The FDA has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of April 29, 2025. \u201cThe FDA acceptance of our BLA resubmission moves us one step closer to providing pz-cel as a differentiated treatment option to address the persistent unmet needs of people with RDEB in the U.S.,\u201d said Vish Seshadri, Chief Executive Officer of Abeona. \u201cWe look forward to continuing to work with the FDA to finalize the review of the pz-cel application.\u201d The BLA resubmission is supported by clinical efficacy and safety data after a one-time administration of pz-cel from the pivotal Phase 3 VIITAL\u2122 study (NCT04227106) and a Phase 1/2a study (NCT01263379) with up to 8 years of follow-up. If approved, pz-cel would be the first autologous, cell-based gene therapy for RDEB, and the first RDEB treatment designed to provide collagen VII expression at wound sites via a stably integrated copy of the COL7A1 gene. The Company\u2019s BLA for pz-cel was previously accepted for Priority Review by the FDA for patients with RDEB. Abeona may be eligible for a Priority Review Voucher (PRV) should pz-cel be approved. About prademagene zamikeracel (pz-cel) Prademagene zamikeracel (pz-cel), Abeona\u2019s investigational autologous, COL7A1 gene therapy, is currently being developed for the treatment of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), a rare genetic skin disease caused by a mutation in both copies of the COL7A1 gene. As a result of this defect, cells are unable to express functional collagen VII protein which is needed to form anchoring fibrils that bond the epidermis to the dermis. Lack of anchoring fibrils leads to fragile skin that blisters easily and patients suffer from years of painful wounds, itch and increased risk of infection and squamous cell carcinoma. Pz-cel is made from patients' own skin cells that are genetically corrected with a functional COL7A1 gene integrated into the skin cells\u2019 genome to express collagen VII. These gene-corrected cells are expanded to form keratinocyte sheets to cover wound areas in a single surgical application. Pz-cel has been granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, Breakthrough Therapy, Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease designations by the U.S. FDA. Story Continues About Abeona Therapeutics Abeona Therapeutics Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing cell and gene therapies for serious diseases. Prademagene zamikeracel (pz-cel) is Abeona\u2019s investigational autologous, COL7A1 gene-corrected epidermal sheets currently in development for recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. The Company\u2019s fully integrated cell and gene therapy cGMP manufacturing facility served as the manufacturing site for pz-cel used in its Phase 3 VIITAL\u2122 trial, and is capable of supporting commercial production of pz-cel upon FDA approval. The Company\u2019s development portfolio also features AAV-based gene therapies for ophthalmic diseases with high unmet medical need. Abeona\u2019s novel, next-generation AAV capsids are being evaluated to improve tropism profiles for a variety of devastating diseases. For more information, visit www.abeonatherapeutics.com .
