'If people go away, the future goes away.' Thomas Gnau, Springfield News-Sun, Ohio Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 7:59 AM 3 min read Jan. 21\u2014Area manufacturers need skilled workers to fill open positions, and how to recruit these types of employees remains at the top of their concerns going into 2025. Most manufacturers are trying to make sure their business is sustainable, said Beth Graves, president of Prime Controls. Unless a company is highly reliant on robotics, businesses need people, and skilled people at that, she said. \"If people go away, then the future goes away,\" Graves said. The Dayton Region Manufacturing Association, which includes Springfield employees, does an annual survey of companies and their needs going into the new year. Besides the the need for skilled workers, the annual DRMA survey also notes business costs, regulations, succession planning and other concerns remain on manufacturers' minds. In 2023, area manufacturers had a total $11.6 billion annual payroll in a 14-county West Central Ohio region around Dayton, with 2,487 companies employing a collective 130,861 people, 15.3% of the region's workforce. From 2020 to 2024, there were 1,763 average monthly job openings in the field of manufacturing across the region. Average annual earnings in the field, including management positions, exceeded $86,000, the DRMA said. Total payroll in manufacturing amounted to 15.6% of the region's total annual payroll. Gross regional product was put at $21.7 billion, with nearly $7 billion invested in 2022 and 2023, thanks to the expansion of 61 facilities, the construction of 13 new facilities and the creation of 10,054 jobs in the field, according to the data. Filling the gaps Graves, a member of the DRMA's government relations committee, has 18 employees at her Kettering company. But she always has her eye on \"gaps\" where new employees may be needed. Said Graves, \"For us, getting skilled workers is probably the most challenging, just because we have both production, which needs workers to be really skilled in electronic assembly, and also engineering.\" \"The pool of talent available is very small,\" she said. \"It's just a challenge, if you lose someone, to replace them.\" For Prime Controls, it is possible to train people willing to work and learn. But in some fields, like engineering, software and hardware design, companies need people with degrees, established skills and experience. \"We're strengthening our bench in engineering, because our director of engineering is within five to 10 years of retiring,\" Graves said. Her business makes inspection equipment for the metal forming industry, mostly for manufacturers and metal stampers who make cans or work in the automotive and other sectors. Story Continues The manufacturing industry faced a setback after losing roughly 1.4 million jobs during the pandemic, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce recently found. Since then, the industry on a national level has made what the chamber called \"significant strides\" toward recovery. The chamber found that while durable goods manufacturing has seen a stronger recovery compared to nondurable goods manufacturing, as of January 2024, \"a gap persists, with 622,000 total manufacturing job openings yet to be filled.\" Other issues identified in DRMA's survey: International trade and global competition. Specific concerns include the effect of trade agreements, tariffs, fair/free trade policy, and international currency manipulations, a DRMA statement said. \"Members want a level playing field in international trade with as little volatility as possible.\" Corporate tax rate and tax code. DRMA said its members support the idea that lower corporate tax rates encourage growth. Therefore, \"members support reforms to the tax code to make it simpler and less burdensome.\" View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard Recommended Stories", "symbol": "DRMA", "date":

additional indications - Xyngari \u2122 with Daxxify\u00ae has the potential to be the first approved needle-free intradermal delivery of a botulinum toxin product - SAN DIEGO, CA and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, CA / ACCESS Newswire / January 21, 2025 / Dermata Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:DRMA)(NASDAQ:DRMAW) (\"Dermata\") and Revance Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: RVNC) (\"Revance\" together with Dermata \"Companies\") today announced the Companies have entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement to evaluate the topical application of Xyngari\u2122 (formerly known as DMT310), Dermata's topical Spongilla powder, with Daxxify\u00ae (daxibotulinumtoxinA-lanm), Revance's botulinum toxin type A. The Companies intend to first evaluate Xyngari\u2122 with Daxxify\u00ae for the topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis and may explore additional indications through a broader partnership in the future. \"We are excited to partner with Revance to further clinical development of our unique program, using our Xyngari\u2122 product for a needle-free, intradermal delivery of a botulinum toxin, like Daxxify\u00ae, to the dermis,\" said Gerald Proehl, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Dermata. \"This clinical development collaboration will provide the cooperative framework to fully evaluate the treatment effect of Xyngari\u2122 with Daxxify\u00ae for treating hyperhidrosis and potentially additional medical and aesthetic indications. We believe that the unique broad coverage ability of Xyngari\u2122, with a long-lasting botulinum toxin like Daxxify\u00ae, could provide patients with a potentially superior treatment option than current injections of a botulinum toxin with a needle.\" \"Revance is excited to partner with Dermata to jointly explore the potential for Daxxify\u00ae and Xyngari\u2122 for the needle-free treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis and to expand the opportunities for Daxxify\u00ae beyond injections,\" commented Mark Foley, Chief Executive Officer of Revance. Phase 2a Clinical Trial Design The Phase 2a clinical trial will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Xyngari\u2122 and Daxxify\u00ae versus Xyngari\u2122 and placebo in patients with moderate-to-severe axillary hyperhidrosis for 16 weeks. The trial will be randomized (1:1:1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, enrolling approximately 48 patients across sites in the United States. The endpoints will be the percent of patients with greater than 50% reduction in gravimetrically measured sweat production from baseline, the percent of patients with gravimetric sweat production less than 50mg, and the mean absolute change from baseline in gravimetrically measured sweat production. Patients will be evaluated at 4 regular intervals. Story Continues Daxxify\u00ae has received approval in the United States for specific uses in treating moderate to severe glabellar lines and cervical dystonia, while Xyngari\u2122 is currently in a Phase 3 clinical program in moderate-to-severe acne. Daxxify's proprietary formulation is manufactured without the use of animal or human proteins and contains highly purified 150 kDa core neurotoxin and the patented peptide excipient RTP004. Xyngari\u2122 with Botulinum Toxin Program Xyngari\u2122 with botulinum toxin is the Dermata's treatment regimen that uses the unique mechanical features of Xyngari\u2122 to facilitate the intradermal delivery of a botulinum toxin by topical application rather than through multiple injections with a needle. Xyngari's\u2122 microscopic spicules penetrate the stratum corneum to create microchannels into the dermis allowing for the topical application and penetration of botulinum toxin. Dermata has successfully completed proof-of-concept Phase 1 clinical trials using Xyngari\u2122 with a botulinum toxin for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis and for the treatment of multiple aesthetic skin conditions.

Therapeutics Mon, Dec 16, 2024, 5:00 PM 5 min read In This Article: DRMA 0.00% DRMAW +2.07% Dermata Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:DRMA)(NASDAQ:DRMAW) (\"Dermata\" or the \"Company\"), a late-stage biotechnology company focusing on the treatment of medical and aesthetic skin diseases and conditions, today announced that it received approval from U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the proprietary name, Xyngari (pronounced zin-gar-ee) (formerly DMT310), for its Phase 3 clinical drug candidate in acne. The proprietary name, Xyngari, is approved pending the successful submission and acceptance of a new drug application (NDA). \"The FDA approving the Xyngari name is just one more successful step our team has completed in the development program for this unique product candidate,\" commented Gerry Proehl, Dermata's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. \"Having an approved proprietary name with the approaching Phase 3 acne topline results expected in March 2025, and recent notice of allowance of a US patent covering Xyngari for the treatment of acne, we believe, positions Dermata well to complete this development program and eventually file an NDA. Our team is excited about the prospect of making Xyngari available to patients, if approved, as we see great commercial opportunity for Xyngari, as it is potentially the first safe, effective, once-weekly, topical product to treat acne,\" concluded Mr. Proehl. Xyngari Phase 3 STAR-1 Clinical Study Design The Xyngari Phase 3 S pongilla T reatment of A cne R esearch (STAR-1) clinical study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Xyngari in patients with moderate-to-severe facial acne. The STAR-1 study is a randomized (2:1), double-blind, and placebo-controlled study with 520 patients enrolled with moderate-to-severe acne, ages 9 years and older in the United States and Latin America. The primary endpoints include the mean change from baseline in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts and the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) treatment response. IGA is measured on a 5-point scale (0-4), with a treatment response defined as at least a 2-point improvement from baseline and an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). Patients are treated once-a-week for 12 weeks with either Xyngari or placebo and are evaluated monthly. The STAR-1 study is the first of two pivotal Phase 3 studies required by the FDA, of which the second Phase 3 study will be followed by an extension study. If positive, the results from both Phase 3 studies would be used to support the filing of an NDA with FDA. About Xyngari (formerly DMT310) Xyngari is a novel, once-weekly, topical product candidate derived from a freshwater sponge being developed for the treatment of multiple skin diseases. Xyngari has multiple mechanisms of action that include mechanical components and chemical compounds to help treat inflammatory skin diseases, like acne. After processing, the sponge powder contains precisely sized and shaped silica spicules that upon application may help exfoliate the skin, promote collagen production, open closed comedones (creating an aerobic environment to help kill C. acne bacteria), and create microchannels to facilitate penetration of the sponge's naturally occurring chemical compounds. These chemical compounds have been shown, in-vitro, to have both antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, which may play a significant role in the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases. Xyngari has previously shown its treatment effect in moderate-to-severe acne in a Phase 2b study where once weekly applications achieved statistically significant results at all timepoints for all primary and secondary endpoints. Xyngari also saw almost 45% of patients achieving an IGA score of clear or almost clear compared with less than 18% for placebo patients. Story Continues About Dermata Therapeutics Dermata Therapeutics is a late-stage biotechnology company focusing on the treatment of medical and aesthetic skin diseases and conditions. The Company's lead product candidate, Xyngari (formerly DMT310), is the first product candidate being developed from its Spongilla technology platform. Xyngari is a once-weekly, topical product candidate derived from a naturally sourced freshwater sponge with multiple unique mechanisms of action. In addition to acne, Xyngari has been studied for the treatment of psoriasis and rosacea. The Company's second product candidate, DMT410, uses Xyngari as a new method for needle-free intradermal delivery of botulinum toxin for the treatment of multiple aesthetic and medical skin diseases and conditions. Dermata is headquartered in San Diego, California. For more information, please visit http://www.dermatarx.com/ .

min read In This Article: DRMA 0.00% DRMAW +2.07% SAN DIEGO, CA / ACCESSWIRE / December 10, 2024 / Dermata Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:DRMA)(Nasdaq:DRMAW) (\"Dermata\" or the \"Company\"), a late-stage biotechnology company focusing on the treatment of medical and aesthetic skin diseases and conditions, today announced receipt of a notice of allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office of a new patent for its DMT310 product candidate for the treatment of acne. The allowed patent application, entitled \"Compositions and methods for the treatment of skin conditions\" (U.S. Application No. 17/420,635), further strengthens Dermata's intellectual property for DMT310. \"We are thrilled to receive this notice of allowance in the U.S., which we believe further validates DMT310's novel approach to treat acne with a once weekly topical product,\" commented Gerry Proehl, Dermata's Chairman, President, and CEO. \"Given the unique features and benefits of DMT310, we believe, if approved, it could potentially transform the current acne treatment guidelines and allow DMT310 to be a first-line treatment option. We also recently completed enrollment in the first of two DMT310 Phase 3 studies and are eager to announce topline results in March of 2025. We look forward to this allowed patent application eventually advancing to issuance and support our intellectual property protections for DMT310.\" About DMT310 DMT310 is a novel, once-weekly, topical product candidate derived from a freshwater sponge being developed for the treatment of multiple skin diseases. DMT310 has multiple mechanisms of action that include mechanical components and chemical compounds to help treat inflammatory skin diseases, like acne. After processing, the sponge powder contains precisely sized and shaped silica spicules that upon application may help exfoliate the skin, promote collagen production, open closed comedones (creating an aerobic environment to help kill C. acne bacteria), and create microchannels to facilitate penetration of the sponge's naturally occurring chemical compounds. These chemical compounds have been shown, in-vitro, to have both antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, which may play a significant role in the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases. DMT310 has previously shown its treatment effect in moderate-to-severe acne in a Phase 2b study where DMT310 applied once weekly, achieved statistically significant results at all timepoints for all primary and secondary endpoints. DMT310 also observed almost 45% of patients achieving an IGA score of clear or almost clear compared with less than 18% of placebo patients achieving the same at the end of 12 weeks. Story Continues About Acne Vulgaris Over 30 million acne patients in the U.S. seek treatment each year, with about 85% of teenagers experiencing some form of acne, and some individuals suffering from acne well into their 30s, 40s, and beyond. Acne is characterized by areas of scaly red skin, noninflammatory blackheads and whiteheads, inflammatory papules and pustules, and occasionally cysts and scarring, which can present on the face, neck, chest, back, shoulders, and upper arms. While not life-threatening, acne can cause significant trauma for those suffering from it due to social stigmas, substantial risk of permanent facial scarring, lowered self-esteem, and social withdrawal. About Dermata Therapeutics Dermata Therapeutics is a late-stage biotechnology company focusing on the treatment of medical and aesthetic skin conditions and diseases. The Company's lead product candidate, DMT310, is the first product candidate being developed from its Spongilla technology platform. DMT310 is a once-weekly, topical product candidate derived from a naturally sourced freshwater sponge with multiple unique mechanisms of action. In addition to acne, DMT310 has been studied for the treatment of psoriasis and rosacea. The Company's second product candidate, DMT410, uses its DMT310 product as a new method for needle-free intradermal delivery of botulinum toxin for the treatment of multiple aesthetic and medical skin conditions and diseases.

The STAR-1 study is the first of two Phase 3 studies that, if positive, would be used by Dermata to support the filing of a new drug application (NDA) for DMT310 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne. \"We are thrilled to complete enrollment in the STAR-1 study in less than a year,\" commented Gerry Proehl, Dermata's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. \"I am proud of our team's persistence and efforts to complete study enrollment of this pivotal trial on schedule, thereby positioning the Company to receive the highly anticipated topline results in March 2025. We also want to express our sincerest appreciation to all patients and investigators who participated in this study as it would not be possible without them. We continue to be enthusiastic about DMT310 and its potential to be the first and only approved once-weekly, topical product for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne. We believe patients continue to be disappointed with the slow onset of action of current treatments, while experiencing immediate tolerability issues, and we believe DMT310 could address these issues, creating a paradigm shift in the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne.\" DMT310 Phase 3 STAR-1 Clinical Study Design The DMT310 Phase 3 STAR-1 clinical study data will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of DMT310 in patients with moderate-to-severe facial acne. The STAR-1 study is a randomized (2:1), double-blind, and placebo-controlled study enrolling 520 patients with moderate-to-severe acne, ages 9 years and older in the United States and Latin America. The primary endpoints include the mean change from baseline in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts and the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) treatment response. IGA is measured on a 5-point scale (0-4), with a treatment response defined as at least a 2-point improvement from baseline and an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). Patients are treated once-a-week for 12 weeks with either DMT310 or placebo and are evaluated monthly. The STAR-1 study is the first of two pivotal Phase 3 studies, of which the second Phase 3 study will be followed by an extension study. If positive, the results from both Phase 3 studies would be used to support the filing of an NDA with FDA. Story Continues About DMT310 DMT310 is a novel, once-weekly, topical product candidate derived from a freshwater sponge being developed for the treatment of multiple skin diseases. DMT310 has multiple mechanisms of action that include mechanical components and chemical compounds to help treat inflammatory skin diseases, like acne. After processing, the sponge powder contains precisely sized and shaped silica spicules that upon application may help exfoliate the skin, promote collagen production, open closed comedones (creating an aerobic environment to help kill C. acne bacteria), and create microchannels to facilitate penetration of the sponge's naturally occurring chemical compounds. These chemical compounds have been shown, in-vitro, to have both antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, which may play a significant role in the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases. DMT310 has previously shown its treatment effect in moderate-to-severe acne in a Phase 2b study where DMT310 applied once weekly, achieved statistically significant results at all timepoints for all primary and secondary endpoints. DMT310 also observed almost 45% of patients achieving an IGA score of clear or almost clear compared with less than 18% of placebo patients achieving the same at the end of 12 weeks. About Acne Vulgaris Over 30 million acne patients in the U.S. seek treatment each year, with about 85% of teenagers experiencing some form of acne, and some individuals suffering from acne well into their 30s, 40s, and beyond. Acne is characterized by areas of scaly red skin, noninflammatory blackheads and whiteheads, inflammatory papules and pustules, and occasionally cysts and scarring, which can present on the face, neck, chest, back, shoulders, and upper arms. While not life-threatening, acne can cause significant trauma for those suffering from it due to social stigmas, substantial risk of permanent facial scarring, lowered self-esteem, and social withdrawal. About Dermata Therapeutics Dermata Therapeutics is a late-stage biotechnology company focusing on the treatment of medical and aesthetic skin conditions and diseases. The Company's lead product candidate, DMT310, is the first product candidate being developed from its Spongilla technology platform. DMT310 is a once-weekly, topical product candidate derived from a naturally sourced freshwater sponge with multiple unique mechanisms of action. In addition to acne, DMT310 has been studied for the treatment of psoriasis and rosacea. The Company's second product candidate, DMT410, uses its DMT310 product as a new method for needle-free intradermal delivery of botulinum toxin for the treatment of multiple aesthetic and medical skin conditions and diseases.

Dermata Therapeutics Dermata Therapeutics Thu, Nov 14, 2024, 12:15 AM 7 min read In This Article: DRMA 0.00% DRMAW +2.07% - Dermata nears completion of enrollment in its DMT310 Phase 3 Spongilla Treatment of Acne Research (STAR-1) clinical trial - - Dermata continues discussions with potential botulinum toxin partners for DMT410 - - Raised $5.1 million in gross proceeds from financings completed in 3Q 2024 - SAN DIEGO, CA / ACCESSWIRE / November 13, 2024 / Dermata Therapeutics , Inc. (Nasdaq:DRMA; DRMAW) (\"Dermata,\" or the \"Company\"), a late-stage biotechnology company focused on the treatment of medical and aesthetic skin diseases and conditions, today highlighted recent corporate progress and reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \"The third quarter was a busy time for our team as we approach completing enrollment in our DMT310 Phase 3 STAR-1 study and were able to raise funds, which we believe will allow us to reach the topline data readout in the STAR-1 study in the first quarter of 2025,\" commented Gerry Proehl, Dermata's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. \"We believe patients deserve an acne treatment that is safe, well-tolerated, applied only once-a-week, with a significant 45% reduction in inflammatory lesions after just four applications, as seen in our DMT310 Phase 2b acne study. With many unique features and benefits, we believe DMT310 can cause a paradigm shift in the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne, if approved,\" concluded Mr. Proehl. Corporate Highlights Achieved 50% enrollment in its DMT310 Phase 3 STAR-1 clinical trial in moderate-to-severe acne. After achieving the 50% enrollment milestone in July 2024, Dermata expects to receive topline results from the STAR-1 study in the first quarter of 2025. STAR-1 is the first of two Phase 3 clinical trials, including a long-term extension study, which the Company will need to complete prior to filing a new drug application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Raised $7.8 million in gross proceeds during 2024. The funds raised during 2024, along with the Company's existing cash, is expected to fund its operations into the second quarter of 2025. Anticipated Upcoming Milestones Complete enrollment in its DMT310 Phase 3 STAR-1 clinical trial in moderate-to-severe acne. Dermata expects to complete enrollment in the STAR-1 study by the end of 2024 and plans to announce topline results from the DMT310 Phase 3 STAR-1 study in the first quarter of 2025. DMT410 Partnership Discussions. The Company continues to make progress on partnership discussions for its DMT410 program for the topical delivery of botulinum toxin. DMT410 is the Company's combination treatment regimen that uses the unique mechanical features of the Company's DMT310 product to facilitate the intradermal delivery of botulinum toxin by topical application rather than through multiple injections with a needle. The Company believes DMT410 has the potential be to a first-in-class treatment for hyperhidrosis, acne, and facial aesthetics. Story Continues Dermata Conference Participation Life Sciences Investor Forum Date: Thursday, November 14, 2024 Time: 12:00pm ET Link: https://bit.ly/3NuUDa4 H.C. Wainwright 26th Annual Global Investment Conference 2024 Maxim Healthcare Virtual Summit Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $6.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $7.4 million as of December 31, 2023. The $1.3 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulted from $8.2 million of cash used in operations offset by $7.0 million in net financing proceeds. The Company expects its current cash resources to be sufficient to fund operations into the second quarter of 2025. Research and development expenses were $2.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $0.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in research and development expense was the result of increased clinical trial expenses from the Company's STAR-1 clinical study, offset by decreased non-clinical and chemistry, manufacturing, and control expenses during the third quarter of 2024. General and administrative expenses were $0.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $0.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was the result of decreased insurance costs.
