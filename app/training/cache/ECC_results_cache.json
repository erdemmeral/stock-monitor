players learn CPR, join the Nation of Lifesavers movement NewMediaWire Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 11:00 PM 6 min read ( NewMediaWire ) - January 27, 2025 - MOBILE, Ala. The American Heart Association and the Reese's Senior Bowl(TM) teamed up to ensure more people are confident and capable when faced with a cardiac emergency. On Senior Bowl Community Service Day, Jan. 27, the potential NFL Draft prospects who have completed their college eligibility and coaches learned Hands-Only CPR and how to use an automatic external defibrillators (AED) to respond in a cardiac emergency. According to American Heart Association data , 9 out of every 10 of people who experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital die, in part because they do not receive immediate CPR more than half of the time. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), especially if performed immediately, can double or triple a person's chance of survival. \"Early recognition and action in a cardiac emergency are the difference between life and death. When seconds matter it is important to have people nearby who are confident and capable of beginning administering CPR. This event with the Senior Bowl football players and coaches is helping to support that critical link in the communities where players and fans live work and play\" said Nancy Brown, chief executive officer of the American Heart Association. \"We know that with every CPR training we perform we are one step closer to ensuring that everyone, everywhere is prepared and empowered to perform CPR and become a vital link in the chain of survival.\" On Jan. 27, known as Senior Bowl Community Service Day, one of the festivities leading up to the Reese's Senior Bowl game on Saturday, Feb. 1, players and coaches use manikins to learn the correct rate and depth of compressions. Compression-only CPR known as Hands-Only CPR can be equally effective as traditional CPR for adults and teens in the first few minutes of emergency response and is a skill everyone can learn. It is as simple as calling 911 if you see a teen or adult suddenly collapse and then push hard and fast in the center of the chest. The Reese's Senior Bowl which will be held at Hancock Whitney Stadium located on the campus of the University of South Alabama in Mobile is widely regarded as the preeminent college football all-star game and the first stage in the NFL Draft process. \"This opportunity for our players with the American Heart Association is very meaningful for the Reese's Senior Bowl. Our players leave Mobile every year as better football players after receiving NFL coaching for the first time and now providing them with CPR training will give them a valuable life skill beyond the game of football,\" says Reese's Senior Bowl Executive Director Jim Nagy. Story Continues The Nation of Lifesavers movement initiative's national ambassador is cardiac arrest survivor, Senior Bowl alumni (2021) and Buffalo Bills safety, Damar Hamlin. Hamlin suffered sudden cardiac arrest in January 2023 on Monday Night Football. He received CPR and AED live on television as in-stadium attendees and viewers at home watched those very first links in the chain of survival working. Other Senior Bowl alumni serving as members of the 2024 Nation of Lifesaver Ambassador Class , comprised of current NFL players who support efforts to build awareness of lifesaving CPR, include Cincinnati Bengals running back Chris Evans (2021) and Chicago Bears tight end Gerald Everett (2017). Last year, the NFL launched The Smart Heart Sports Coalition in collaboration with founding members including the American Heart Association, NBA, MLB, MLS, NHL, NCAA, and others. The coalition aims to advocate for all 50 states to adopt specific evidence-based policies to help prevent fatal outcomes from cardiac arrest among high school student-athletes. The American Heart Association reports that more than 23,000 people under the age of 18 experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital every year, with nearly 40% being sports related. It is a leading cause of death for student-athletes. Implementing these simple, cost-effective strategies across all 50 states can save lives. The American Heart Association, publisher of the official scientific guidelines for CPR , is the worldwide leader in resuscitation science, education and training. With nearly 3 out of 4 cardiac arrests outside of the hospital occurring in homes, knowing how to perform CPR is critically important. When more bystanders know CPR, the chance for a positive recovery increase for the community. In addition to the CPR education, the American Heart Association had the Association's Paul \"Bear\" Bryant Coach of the Year Award on display for players and coaches to view. Paul \"Bear\" Bryant Coach of the Year Award annually recognizes the country's top college football coach for their contributions both on and off the field, as well as efforts to make the sport better for athletes and fans alike by demonstrating grit, integrity and a winning approach to coaching and life. The Coach of the Year award is voted on by the National Sports Media Association, current NCAA College football coaches, former Coach of the Year Award winners, the Paul \"Bear\" Bryant Awards' Executive Leadership Team and the Bryant family.

"C5MI Launches First Successful SAP S/4HANA (S/4) Migration for the Department of Defense (DoD) PR Newswire Sat, Jan 25, 2025, 12:51 AM 4 min read C5MI Completes S/4HANA Migration for the Largest Deployment of an SAP Warehouse Management System (WMS) at Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) \"The S/4 upgrade within the DLA's SAP WMS is a tremendous accomplishment for C5MI, SAP, and DLA. It opens the door and creates the foundation for the broader DLA transformation initiatives, allowing the agency to optimize its world-class support to the Warfighter. I am very proud of the C5MI team for leading this first S/4 transition within the Department of Defense with high quality and unprecedented velocity.\" \u2014 Derek Dyer , C5MI President and Co-Founder JACKSONVILLE BEACH, Fla. , Jan. 24, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- C5MI , an industry leader in digital transformation, has successfully partnered with DLA to complete the first and only S/4 migration within the DoD . This landmark project significantly advances the DoD's digital transformation efforts, setting a new technological integration and efficiency standard. Executing this project within the largest SAP Warehouse Management System (WMS) deployment in the U.S. Federal Government is no small success. C5MI Logo The ambitious project began in late November and was launched in mid-January. It was completed in half the expected time. Using machine learning, S/4 unifies business processes and analyzes data in real-time. This was a collaborative effort between C5MI, DLA, and SAP, with C5MI leading the initiative. This rollout underscores the power of collaboration with government and industry and a result-driven approach, achieving positive outcomes efficiently and effectively. This complex implementation successfully managed significant data model changes and minimized deployment disruption. Eighty-six DLA sites out of the 125 on DLA's roadmap have been deployed, pushing the DLA to S/4 well before the SAP Business Suite 2027 end-of-service deadline when SAP will cease support for its legacy ERP Systems, ECC, and R3. This transformation highlights C5MI's operations-led approach and DLA's incredible partnership approach, which were crucial to the project's success. C5MI combines best-in-class technical expertise with real-world operational experience to uncover a common picture focusing on client priorities. \"I could not be prouder of this team,\" said Aaron Kirkham , DLA WMS Portfolio Manager. \"Accepting the challenge of executing a migration to S/4 in the middle of\u00a0the\u00a0WMS modernization effort is nothing short of amazing. The\u00a0precision and speed demonstrated in this migration is a perfect example of what can be accomplished\u00a0when\u00a0the government and industry strike the right partnership.\" The project's success has established a repeatable, scalable, and cost-effective delivery model for ongoing S/4 rollouts, significantly shaping the future of the DoD's digital modernization and fortification efforts. The collaboration among these teams underscores C5MI's industry leadership, enabling DLA to enhance its world-class support services. These collective accomplishments will improve operational efficiency and readiness for the Warfighter. Story Continues As C5MI continues to partner with DLA to roll out its new WMS system, this mid-program migration to S/4 prepares them to accelerate predictive maintenance and analytics efforts that will drive future efficiencies and cost savings. The S/4 system allows federal agencies and commercial customers to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and gain access to real-time data with modern architecture that can automate tasks and integrate systems. The process C5MI leveraged for this significant milestone is repeatable, scalable, and cost-effective. With extensive cleared personnel to deliver in the United States for the US Federal Government and DoD, federal organizations have no better time to take the next step on their S/4 journey.

NewMediaWire Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 11:30 PM 5 min read ( NewMediaWire ) - January 24, 2025 - LAS VEGAS The American Heart Association and the Las Vegas Raiders gathered representatives from 12 local schools for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external defibrillator (AED) training on Jan. 23 at Kenneth Divich Elementary School in Las Vegas. According to American Heart Association data , nearly 9 out of 10 people who experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital die, in part because they do not receive immediate CPR more than half of the time. CPR, especially if performed immediately, can double or triple a person's chance of survival. \"Early recognition and action in a cardiac emergency are the difference between life and death. When seconds matter it is important to have people nearby who are confident and capable of beginning administering CPR. This event with the Las Vegas Raiders is helping to support that critical link in the community,\" said Nancy Brown, chief executive officer of the American Heart Association. \"We know that with every CPR training we perform we are one step closer to ensuring that everyone, everywhere is prepared and empowered to perform CPR and become a vital link in the chain of survival.\" The American Heart Association is the worldwide leader in resuscitation science, education and training, and publishes the official scientific guidelines for CPR . With nearly 3 out of 4 cardiac arrests outside of the hospital occurring in homes, knowing how to perform CPR is critically important. With more people ready to perform CPR, the chance for a positive recovery increase for the community. Compression-only CPR, known as Hands-Only CPR, can be equally effective as traditional CPR in the first few minutes of emergency response and is a skill everyone can learn. It is as simple as calling 911 if you see a teen or adult suddenly collapse and then push hard and fast in the center of the chest. The schools receiving CPR in Schools kits are: Kenneth Divich Elementary School Southern Highlands Preparatory School Somerset Academies Elise Wolff Elementary Pinecrest Academy Tyrone Thompson Elementary School D'Vorre and Hal Ober Elementary School Judy and John Goolsby Elementary School Willam and Mary Scherkenbach Elementary School Lake Mead Christian Academy Good Samaritan Christian Academy Adelson School In addition to the training, the Raiders are donating resources for schools to bring these lifesaving skills back to their campuses and continue to build confidence and capabilities to respond in a cardiac emergency. Each of the 12 schools received a CPR in Schools kit and three of the schools attending received an AED. The CPR in Schools kits include 10 Hands-Only CPR manikins and 10 AED training tools and curriculum to train additional students, faculty, staff and parents. The attending representatives learned the correct rate and depth of compressions and how to use their new resources. Story Continues \"By equipping schools with CPR training and resources, we are providing students, faculty and staff with life-saving skills,\" said Kari Uyehara, Executive Director of the Raiders Foundation. \"The Raiders organization is committed to building healthier communities and we are proud to partner with the American Heart Association on this event.\" In 2023, the NFL launched The Smart Heart Sports Coalition in collaboration with founding members including the NBA, MLB, MLS, NHL, NCAA, the American Heart Association and others. The coalition aims to advocate for all 50 states to adopt evidence-based policies to help prevent fatal outcomes from cardiac arrest among high school students. The American Heart Association reports that as many as 23,000 people under the age of 18 experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital every year, with nearly 40% being sports related. It is a leading cause of death for student-athletes. Implementing these simple, cost-effective strategies across all 50 states can save lives. Photos available on the right side of the release link .

My name is Logical Thesis and I'm a writer for WOLF Financial. If you are looking for more investing related content, I guarantee you\u2019ll enjoy my content on \ud835\udd4f, @LogicalThesis. Thanks for reading! Quantum computing is a rapidly advancing field that poses significant challenges to the cryptographic foundations of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Here\u2019s a look at the potential risks: 1. Breaking Cryptographic Algorithms Cryptocurrencies rely on cryptographic techniques like elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to secure transactions and wallets. A sufficiently powerful quantum computer could leverage Shor's algorithm to break ECC, exposing private keys from public keys. This could lead to: Unauthorized access to wallets. Theft of funds across the blockchain. 2. 51% Attacks Made Easier Quantum computing could accelerate mining capabilities to the point where a bad actor might dominate the network's hash rate, executing a 51% attack. This would allow manipulation of transaction histories and double-spending. 3. Compromising Blockchain Integrity The integrity of blockchain data relies on its immutability and trust in cryptographic hashes. Grover's algorithm could weaken hash functions, making it faster for attackers to find hash collisions, undermining proof-of-work mechanisms. 4. Loss of Trust Even the perception of quantum computing's threat could destabilize cryptocurrency markets. If users lose confidence in the security of the blockchain, mass withdrawals and reduced adoption may follow. Mitigation Strategies Quantum-Resistant Cryptography: Developing and adopting algorithms that are secure against quantum attacks, such as lattice-based cryptography. Forking to Secure Chains: Transitioning to quantum-resistant blockchains before quantum computing becomes a practical threat. While fully functional quantum computers capable of breaking current cryptographic systems are not yet realized, advancements are accelerating. It\u2019s essential for the cryptocurrency ecosystem to prepare for this impending challenge to ensure long-term security and viability.
