[{"text": "Citi\u2019s private-bank chief is leaving A 'Citi' sign is displayed outside Citigroup Center near Citibank headquarters in Manhattan on December 5, 2012 in New York City. \u00b7 Banking Dive \u00b7 Mario Tama via Getty Images Dan Ennis Tue, Jan 28, 2025, 3:33 PM 4 min read In This Article: C -1.56% This story was originally published on Banking Dive . To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Banking Dive newsletter . Ida Liu, the global head of Citi\u2019s private bank, is leaving the company at the end of this month, and the bank is eliminating her role, according to a LinkedIn post Monday and a memo seen by Bloomberg . Rather than have one private-banking chief, Citi will use four regional heads who will report to Andy Sieg , the bank\u2019s head of global wealth. Steven Lo will lead Citi\u2019s private-banking efforts in Japan, Australia, North Asia and Asia South. Antonio Gonzales will lead Latin America private banking. James Holder will be responsible for private banking in the U.K., Europe and the Middle East. And Cayman Wills will be the interim head of private banking in North America, Citi announced Monday. \u201cThis will enable even closer collaboration with leaders of the products and functions essential to delivering for our clients around the world,\u201d Sieg wrote in Monday\u2019s memo. The move tracks with Citi\u2019s long-running effort to reduce redundancy and overlapping responsibilities. The bank eliminated five layers of management between September 2023 and March of last year in a wide-scale reorganization that\u2019s ongoing. Liu, an 18-year veteran at Citi, did not detail the next step in her career. \u201cGreat careers are defined by embracing new challenges and opportunities, and this is the right time for me to leverage my global expertise, leadership experience and passion for growth in bold and exciting new ways,\u201d she wrote on LinkedIn, specifying that the decision to leave Citi was hers. Sieg, in a separate memo Monday, said Liu \u201chas left an indelible mark across our organization and will be greatly missed.\u201d It\u2019s not a lock that Liu\u2019s next step will be directly banking-related. She left the sector in 2004 \u2013 five years into a stint in investment banking at Merrill Lynch \u2013 to become an executive with fashion designer Vivienne Tam, according to her LinkedIn profile . Liu returned to banking three years later, after she persuaded Citi to launch a fashion, media and entertainment arm within its private bank. Liu then leveraged her fashion contacts to bring wealthy clients to the bank. She launched Citi\u2019s Asian Clients Group in 2011, landing more business for the bank. Citi named her to lead private banking in New York in 2016, then North America in 2019 and globally in 2021, according to LinkedIn. In Liu, Citi loses a prominent woman executive. Women comprise 17%, or three out of 18 members, of the bank\u2019s executive management committee. That includes CEO Jane Fraser. Story Continues Further, much of Liu\u2019s responsibility is being placed in the care of men: Three of the four regional private-banking chiefs are men; Wills, the interim head for North America, is a woman. Similarly, at least twice recently when women executives of Liu\u2019s stature left Citi, men stood to gain. When Titi Cole , Citi\u2019s reorganization czar, left the bank last May, Citi hired Tim Ryan to lead the legacy franchises Cole oversaw, as part of his duties in technology and business enablement. When Karen Peetz , the bank\u2019s chief administrative officer, retired in May 2023, Citi named Anand Selva as its chief operating officer, placing him in charge of the tech modernization Peetz had previously overseen. At the wealth-management level, eight out of 17 members of Sieg\u2019s leadership team are women. Citi announced two other notable changes to its wealth management business Monday. It named Christian Zeinler, a UBS alum, as head of strategy for Citi Wealth and head of business execution for the private bank. Additionally, the private bank's family office group will become aligned with Citi\u2019s integrated client engagement unit, to be led by Dawn Nordberg, who joined Citi in September from Morgan Stanley. Citi\u2019s private bank is one of three divisions within its wealth-management operations. Under Sieg , the business has emphasized asset management and changed how it pays its private bankers \u2014 compensating them for bringing in client assets rather than per transaction. Fraser, in a quarterly earnings call this month, referred to 2024 as a \u201cturning point for wealth as we sharpened our focus on investments, right-sized the expense base and improved the client experience,\u201d according to the Financial Times . \u201cThis is where we see the big upside,\u201d she said. Income from Citi\u2019s wealth division more than doubled last year to exceed $1 billion, but that success has also been marked by several senior departures, the publication noted. \"Over the past year, across Citi Wealth, we have refocused our business strategy, simplified our organization and set a new trajectory for growth,\" Sieg wrote Monday, according to American Banker . \"Citi Private Bank will be key to continuing this momentum, with its deep connections to wealthy clients and families.\" Recommended Reading Morgan Stanley to cut 3,000 more jobs by June: reports View Comments
