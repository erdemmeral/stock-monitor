[{"text": "Aehr Test Systems: Bull vs. Bear Keith Noonan and Lee Samaha, The Motley Fool Sun, Jan 26, 2025, 4:30 PM 5 min read In This Article: AEHR -4.94% Aehr Test Systems (NASDAQ: AEHR) is a provider of semiconductor testing equipment and other solutions and has exposure to growth trends, including artificial intelligence (AI) and EVs. Its products are highly regarded, and the company enjoys long-term growth catalysts. However, the stock is down roughly 77% from the high it reached in August 2023. The share price has been highly volatile over the last year, and saw a big sell-off earlier this month after Aehr's most recent quarterly report arrived with sales, earnings, and forward guidance that disappointed Wall Street. If you're wondering what comes next for Aehr Test Systems, read on for a look at bull and bear cases presented by two Fool.com contributors. Bull: Long-term growth trumps near-term issues Lee Samaha : There's no point tiptoeing around the elephant in the room. Semiconductor test equipment Aehr Test Systems is a high-risk, high-reward stock and faces significant near-term issues. Management recognizes the risk associated with Chinese bookings (potential trade conflicts and intellectual property risks) and has told investors that \"growth in silicon carbide sales outside of China should remain challenging before recovering in calendar 2026.\" EVs and EV charging networks dominate the demand for silicon carbide chips, and until EV sales recover, automakers will unlikely invest in significantly ramping production. There is a near-term risk but also a huge long-term opportunity, and it comes from four factors. First, the EV market will recover in time, and no one disputes that the clean energy revolution will occur. Second, Aehr recently signed its first deal with an AI customer (a data center company), representing an opening up of a new market that will diversify its revenue streams and customer base. Third, Aehr is also looking to expand in the gallium nitride chip market (an area with exposure to a broad range of industries). That will help diversify its end market revenue. Moreover, management had some good news on a gallium nitride order when disclosing it was \"thrilled to have received their initial production purchase order marking their commitment to advancing volume production.\" Again, Aehr is diversifying its revenue streams. Fourth, for an indication of the industry's confidence in the future of silicon carbide, consider ON Semiconductor 's (an Aehr customer) $2 billion commitment to investing in an expansion of silicon carbide wafer manufacturing in the Czech Republic. These factors speak to the long-term opportunity at Aehr, and the stock is well-suited for the speculative end of a diversified multi-stock portfolio. Story Continues Bear: Cyclical headwinds and China risks Keith Noonan : With the company's market cap having been pushed down to roughly $370 million as of this writing, I wouldn't be surprised to see Aehr Test Systems' stock climb above current levels. But I think that investors also have to consider the possibility that things will get worse before they get better. With its last quarterly report, Aehr reported that sales had fallen 37% year over year to $13.45 million. A decline was already forecast by the company and expected by Wall Street, but the performance came in significantly below the roughly $15 million in sales called for by the average analyst estimate. Adding to the disappointment, the company reported bookings of just $9 million in fiscal Q2, which ended Nov. 29. This came on the heels of $16.8 million in bookings posted in fiscal Q1 and raises concerns about the near-term growth trajectory. The company reported that its order backlog, including subsequent bookings, was now at $26.6 million, so it's still got some significant projects in the delivery pipeline. However, demand indicators suggest the business could have a ways to go before it emerges from its cyclical slog. Inventory accumulated in the period, and Aehr took a write-down on those products, owing to reduced pricing power. Aehr's business has tended to see big fluctuations along with cyclical trends in the semiconductor industry, which isn't a bad thing in and of itself. The difficult part is estimating at what point in a cycle the company is in. With little indication that momentum in the EV market will accelerate this year and uncertainty surrounding whether recent sales in the AI category will continue at current levels in the near term, Aehr's cyclical upswing could be further out than investors are hoping. Adding another potential bearish catalyst, trade issues between the U.S. and China threaten to create significant headwinds for the business. The rise of new China-based competitors and intellectual property concerns are also risk factors. These pressures could cause the company's margins to come in significantly below forecasts or for sales to come in significantly below guidance. If either one of these scenarios winds up playing out, Aehr stock could be pushed below its already beaten-down levels.

Chakrabarti Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 3:59 PM 4 min read In This Article: AEHR -4.94% We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street\u2019s Radar . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Aehr Test Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEHR) stands against other AI stocks on Wall Street\u2019s radar. Artificial Intelligence (AI) companies are rapidly focusing on securing funding to propel R&D, roll out products and services across diverse sectors, and create interconnected ecosystems amid fierce industry competition. According to Reuters analysis of PitchBook data, AI startups have single-handedly contributed to the rebound of US venture capital funding, as total capital raised last year jumped 30% year over year. More importantly, AI startups comprised 46.4% of the total $209 billion raised in 2024, as optimism around AI-powered technology sparked a year-long market rally led by tech giants and semiconductor leaders. However, concerns remain about the rapidly evolving technology as tech leaders prioritise enforcing guardrails to ensure the best use of AI. OpenAI CEO at Davos 2024 OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said during his speech at Davos 2024: \u201cI think it\u2019s good that we and others are being held to a high standard. We can draw on lessons from the past about how technology has been made to be safe and how different stakeholders have handled negotiations about what safe means.\u201d \u201cLet society and the technology co-evolve, and sort of step-by-step with a very tight feedback loop and course correction, build these systems that deliver tremendous value while meeting safety requirements,\u201d he added. Overall, the global markets are optimistic about how leading companies are increasingly developing and integrating AI in their workflows and strategies globally. PWC\u2019s AI Global Study projected that the AI industry could contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, boosting GDP for local economies by 26% on average. Here are the top 10 AI stocks driving the transition to a new era of product development, data flow, and sustainability in 2025. For this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ( see more details here ). Story Continues Aehr Test Systems (AEHR): Pioneering AI Processor Testing with Wafer-Level Burn-In Solutions A technician overlooking a circuit board being built and tested for a semiconductor device. Aehr Test Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: AEHR ) Aehr Test Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEHR) is a leading designer, manufacturer, and seller of test and burn-in products for semiconductor devices in the wafer level, singulated die, and package part forms globally. The company\u2019s high-power package part burn-in test solutions for AI chip manufacturers position it as a top provider of reliability and testing solutions globally. Although the company\u2019s net revenues and cash and equivalents fell sequentially for the quarter ended November 29, 2024, Aehr Test Systems (NASDAQ:AEHR) was able to secure the first AI processor customer for wafer-level burn-in and its first volume production order from the AI client, which happens to be a large-scale data center hyperscaler. \u201cMarket diversification into artificial intelligence (AI) processors, gallium nitride power semiconductors, data storage devices, silicon photonics integrated circuits, and flash memory is driving new opportunities in terms of customers and revenue. This progress includes our wafer-level burn-in solutions and also the success we\u2019re achieving with the new semiconductor package part test and burn-in product line from the acquisition of Incal Technology,\u201d said CEO Gayn Erickson. Overall, AEHR ranks 7th on our list of AI stocks on Wall Street\u2019s radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AEHR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Motley Fool Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 4:44 PM 2 min read In This Article: AEHR -4.94% Shares in Aehr Test Systems (NASDAQ: AEHR) declined by 25.7% in the week to Friday morning. The move comes after its second-quarter 2025 earnings report and management's commentary on its outlook for the year disappointed the market. Long-term growth prospects but near-term uncertainty Aehr is known for its silicon carbide wafer level and test burn-in systems that help chip manufacturers improve productive efficiency. Sales to the silicon carbide chip market have made up 90% of Aehr's sales in the past. Given that about 70% of silicon carbide chips go to the electric vehicle ( EV ) and EV charging infrastructure market, Aehr is heavily dependent on spending on EVs. Unfortunately, that's been a difficult place over the last year as automakers have cut production plans in the face of disappointing EV sales. Moreover, on the earnings call, CEO Gayn Erickson told investors, \"Based on recent market forecasts and large suppliers of silicon carbide semiconductors, growth in silicon carbide sales outside of China should remain challenging before recovering in calendar 2026.\" As such, investors should prepare for a challenging year in Aehr's core market. Meanwhile, Erickson described himself as being \"cautiously optimistic\" about China and noted trade and intellectual property risks associated with the market, and management spoke of higher legal fees in connection with protecting intellectual rights. Image source: Getty Images. What's next for Aehr Test Systems? Despite the disappointing outlook in silicon carbide, it's far from doom and gloom for the company. The company made waves recently by signing its first deal for $10 million in initial orders for test and burn-in equipment for an artificial intelligence (AI) customer (a large-scale data center hyperscaler). In addition, Aehr is looking to expand in the gallium nitride semiconductor market (one with broad-based industry exposure), and that will also help diversify its revenue streams.

Estimates Zacks Equity Research Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 1:15 AM 3 min read In This Article: AEHR -4.94% Aehr Test Systems (AEHR) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.02 per share, missing the Zacks

This compares to year-ago revenues of $21.43 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Aehr Test Systems shares have lost about 1.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -0.9%. What's Next for Aehr Test Systems? While Aehr Test Systems has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

Diversification ... GuruFocus News Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 10:00 AM 3 min read In This Article: AEHR -4.94% Release Date: January 13, 2025 For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript . Positive Points Aehr Test Systems ( NASDAQ:AEHR ) reported significant progress in expanding its product reach into large and fast-growing markets, including AI processors and gallium nitride power semiconductors. The company secured its first AI processor customer for wafer-level burn-in, marking a technological and commercial breakthrough. Aehr Test Systems ( NASDAQ:AEHR ) has diversified its market presence, with AI processors expected to comprise up to 40% of total revenue this fiscal year. The acquisition of Intel technology has accelerated market diversification, particularly in AI processors, enhancing the company's product offerings. The company maintains a strong balance sheet with no debt and continues to invest in scaling its business and pursuing new market opportunities. Negative Points Aehr Test Systems ( NASDAQ:AEHR ) faced a 37% decline in second-quarter revenue compared to the same period last year, primarily due to softness in the silicon carbide power semiconductor market. The company experienced a decline in non-GAAP gross margin to 45.3% from 51.6% last year, attributed to lower overall revenue levels. There are ongoing legal challenges, including a lawsuit in China for intellectual property infringement, which could incur higher legal fees in the coming quarters. The company acknowledged the risk of geopolitical trade and intellectual property issues affecting bookings and revenue from Chinese customers. Aehr Test Systems ( NASDAQ:AEHR ) has not provided multi-year forecasts, creating uncertainty about the timing of long-term sustainable growth. Q & A Highlights Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AEHR. Q : What is the outlook for Aehr Test Systems' long-term sustainable growth, and when can we expect to see significant top-line growth? A : Gayn Erickson, President and CEO, mentioned that while they have not provided multi-year forecasts, they are optimistic about growth in fiscal year '26 and beyond. The company is focusing on expanding into new markets such as AI processors, gallium nitride, and flash memory, which are expected to drive revenue growth. Erickson emphasized that while silicon carbide remains important, the company is diversifying its focus to capture opportunities in these emerging markets. Q : Were there any tools on the shipping dock at the end of the quarter, and is the backlog more of a timing issue? A : Gayn Erickson confirmed that there were indeed tools on the shipping dock, and it was primarily a timing issue. Some customers requested concessions at the end of the fiscal quarter, which delayed the finalization of purchase orders. However, these orders are now being expedited for shipment. Story Continues Q : What are the near-term drivers for Aehr Test Systems beyond silicon carbide, and how do AI and HBM factor into this? A : Gayn Erickson highlighted that AI production, both in package part and wafer level burn-in, is expected to be a significant near-term driver. While the hard disk drive market is attractive, AI and flash memory opportunities are likely to be larger contributors to growth in the coming years. The company is actively pursuing these opportunities to capture market share. Q : How should we think about gross margins for the rest of the fiscal year, given the recent decline? A : Chris, CFO, explained that the decline in gross margins was due to a mix shift towards lower-margin Intel systems. Wafer packs have the highest margins, followed by Aehr Test Systems' legacy products, and then Intel systems. The company expects margins to improve as they integrate Intel products into their operations and achieve operational efficiencies. Q : What is Aehr Test Systems' competitive position in the Chinese market for silicon carbide, especially if the patent infringement case is not successful? A : Gayn Erickson stated that despite the patent infringement case, Aehr Test Systems maintains a strong competitive advantage in terms of reliability and productivity. The company is committed to protecting its intellectual property and believes its solutions offer superior capabilities compared to local competitors.

Recent Business Achievements: Secured the first artificial intelligence (AI) processor customer for wafer level burn-in, utilizing the new high-power FOX-XP TM solution for wafer level production test and burn-in of AI processors. Secured the first volume production orders from an AI processor customer for package part burn-in, utilizing recently acquired Sonoma ultra-high-power systems for high-volume production test and burn-in of AI processors. Secured the first gallium nitride (GaN) customer for high-volume production wafer level burn-in of GaN devices using Aehr FOX-XP platform. Story Continues Gayn Erickson, President and CEO of Aehr Test Systems, commented: \"We achieved significant progress on the key objectives we outlined at the start of the fiscal year, most notably expanding our product reach into additional large and fast-growing markets. Market diversification into artificial intelligence (AI) processors, gallium nitride power semiconductors, data storage devices, silicon photonics integrated circuits, and flash memory is driving new opportunities in terms of customers and revenue. This progress includes our wafer level burn-in solutions and also the success we're achieving with the new semiconductor package part test and burn-in product line from the acquisition of Incal Technology we closed last August. The acquisition has led to the acceleration of our market diversification with particular success and leverage expanding our total available market (TAM) in AI processors. \"Last month, we reached a significant milestone by securing our first AI processor customer for wafer level burn-in. This includes initial volume production ordersfor multiple high-power FOX-XP systems and our proprietary WaferPak TM Contactors, which enable full wafer contact for testing and burn-in of AI processors in wafer form before system integration. This achievement represents a technological and commercial breakthrough for Aehr, significantly expanding the market potential for our FOX-XP wafer level test and burn-in systems. \"During the quarter, we secured our first production AI processor customer for package part burn-in, receiving initial volume production orders for multiple Sonoma ultra-high-power systems. This customer is a large-scale data center hyperscaler and provides computing power and storage capacity to millions of individuals and organizations worldwide. System shipments have already commenced to their contract manufacturer doing test and burn-in for them in Asia. We see a significant potential to expand our packaged part test and burn-in business with the product line acquired from Incal, and feel we are particularly well positioned to capitalize on opportunities in the rapidly growing AI semiconductor market with the ultra-high power Sonoma product line.We estimate that the combined wafer level and package part reliability test and production burn-in market for AI processors will exceed $100 million annually in the future, and with our comprehensive product portfolio we believe we can capture a meaningful share of this market. \"Last week we announced another exciting milestone with our first gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductor production order. This achievement expands our production wafer level burn-in market for power semiconductors beyond silicon carbide used in electric vehicles, data center power conversion, and solar to now include GaN, a high-performance compound semiconductor optimized for mid-power applications such as data centers, solar energy, automotive systems, and consumer computing. Over the past 12 months, we have collaborated with this lead customer using our FOX-NP system, leading to their purchase of multiple WaferPak reference designs for diverse GaN applications. GaN offers a broader application range than silicon carbide and is poised for significant growth in the coming decade. With an expected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) exceeding 40%, the GaN market is projected to surpass $2 billion in annual device sales by 2029, according to Yole Group's Power SiC/GaN Compound Semiconductor Market Monitor. Additionally, Frost & Sullivan estimates GaN semiconductors will account for over 10% of the worldwide power semiconductor industry by 2028. This transformative technology represents a significant growth opportunity for Aehr's wafer level test and burn-in solutions, positioning us to capitalize on the rapid expansion of the GaN market. \"In addition, we are excited about our opportunity for production burn-in and stabilization of devices used in hard disk drives using our FOX-CP systems and WaferPak Contactors. Our lead customer for this application is ramping this year and has told us that they will purchase multiple production systems from us over the next few quarters to support their planned new product rollout and ramp. This customer, first announced back in 2019 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, initially purchased our FOX-CP single wafer test and burn-in solution to support the qualification and early test stages of this new product aimed at the enterprise and data center markets. We view the data storage market both for hard disk drives and flashed-based semiconductor solid-state disk drives as significant growth opportunities for our systems. These markets have applications with devices made up of multiple die in complex structures, or in multiple die stacked on top of each other before they are put into higher-level packages or systems. These devices require exceptionally high levels of quality and long-term reliability of the die before they are put into these packages or systems, which aligns perfectly with the capabilities of our wafer level test and burn-in systems. \"Aehr also continues to expand its presence in the silicon carbide power semiconductor market, a critical sector for power conversion for electric vehicle traction inverters, charging infrastructure, and a range of industrial, data center, and infrastructure applications. Based on recent market forecasts, growth in silicon carbide sales outside of China should remain challenging before recovering in calendar 2026. We believe we are well positioned in this market as we have a large customer base and are currently engaged in benchmarking efforts with multiple potential new silicon carbide customers around the globe, including in China. While we remain cautiously optimistic about the opportunities in China, we also recognize the geopolitical, trade, and intellectual property risks associated with this market. Recently, we filed a lawsuit in China against a local supplier for intellectual property infringement. This action relates to features of products by that company targeted at wafer level burn-in of silicon carbide devices that we believe infringe on Aehr's intellectual property and patents granted to Aehr by the Chinese patent office. Our current fiscal year forecast includes contemplated orders and revenue yet to be booked for silicon carbide wafer level burn-in systems and WaferPaks destined for silicon carbide manufacturers in China. It is important to bring this to our shareholders attention, as recent trade-related developments in the U.S. and the emergence of competitive offerings in China that we believe infringe on our intellectual property have heightened the risk associated with bookings and revenue from Chinese customers. \"As we look at the composition of our total revenue for this fiscal year, silicon carbide is expected to account for less than half our total revenue as we have seen our expansion into additional markets capture real market share gains. AI processors, including wafer level and package parts, could comprise as much as 40% of our total revenue this fiscal year, up from effectively zero revenue last year. GaN, hard disk drives, silicon photonics integrated circuits, and other semiconductor package part revenues will comprise about another 20% of total revenue. We are not pivoting away from silicon carbide but rather are generating growth in these other markets while not seeing the growth in silicon carbide this year like we saw last year. According to recent market research from companies such as Yole, the estimated revenue for silicon carbide semiconductors in 2024 was around $2.5 billion and is expected to reach $10 billion by the end of the decade. To put this into perspective, the semiconductor market is projected to grow from about $600 billion overall in 2024 to over $1 trillion by the end of this decade, so silicon carbide will be about 1% of the overall semiconductor market by 2030. \"Aehr's innovative solutions are poised to capitalize on this growth in the overall semiconductor market by addressing the critical reliability needs of next-generation applications and leveraging key megatrends shaping the semiconductor industry. Reliability has become a critical priority across a wide range of industries, including combustion and electric vehicles, data centers, electrification of the worlds infrastructure, and a wide range of AI applications. Factors such as smaller semiconductor geometries, the increasing adoption of compound and optical semiconductors, and the complexities of ensuring semiconductor reliability ever increasing power and performance of semiconductors and advanced packaging are driving the demand for wafer level and packaged part test and burn-in systems. Aehr's solutions are instrumental in reducing early operational failures and ensuring long-term device performance in these rapidly advancing markets. \"With strong customer engagements, expanding market opportunities, and innovative products designed to meet evolving demands, we are optimistic as we move into the second half of our fiscal year and maintain our previously stated financial guidance for the fiscal year. \"As we've stated before, given the nature of our business with our high ASPs, our quarterly revenue can experience significant variability if system orders anticipated by quarter-end are delayed by even a few days. This was the case in this last quarter, and why we do not provide quarterly guidance. In the case of both our new GaN and wafer level AI customers, both requested pre-built systems that we fully expected to ship to them within the quarter. However, the purchase orders were not finalized until after the quarter ended. Looking past quarterly variations to the full year and beyond, we are excited about the current and emerging market opportunities for our products, which not only position us for a successful fiscal year, but also lay a solid foundation for long-term, sustainable growth in the years ahead.\" Fiscal 2025 Financial Guidance: For the fiscal year ending May 30, 2025, Aehr is reiterating its previously provided guidance for total revenue of at least $70 million and non-GAAP net profit before taxes of at least 10% of revenue.

The non-GAAP measures indicated above are financial measures the Company uses to evaluate the underlying results and operating performance of the business. The limitation of these measures are that they exclude items that impact the Company's current period GAAP measures. This limitation is best addressed by using these measures in combination with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These measures are not in accordance with GAAP and may differ from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. We believe these measures enhance investors' ability to review the Company's business from the same perspective as the Company's management and facilitate comparisons of this period's results with prior periods.

Test Systems (NASDAQ: AEHR) stock is seeing huge sell-offs in Tuesday's trading. The company's share price was down 25.5% as of 11:35 a.m. ET. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index was flat and the Nasdaq Composit e index was down 0.1%. After the market closed yesterday, Aehr published results for the second quarter of its current fiscal year -- which ended Nov. 29. In addition to sales and earnings performance for the period coming in below expectations, the company also issued forward guidance that disappointed Wall Street. Aehr Test Systems stock falls on disappointing quarterly report Aehr posted non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share of $0.02 on sales of $13.45 million in its second quarter. Unfortunately, the average Wall Street estimate had called for the business to deliver an adjusted profit of $0.03 per share on revenue of $15.03 million. Revenue in the period was down roughly 37% year over year, and earnings per share were down roughly 91% compared to the prior-year period. While the semiconductor testing equipment specialist's business is subject to cyclical trends, results in the quarter came in worse than anticipated on multiple fronts and suggest that the business could take longer to move through the down part of the current cycle. Aehr recorded bookings of just $9.2 million in the quarter, which is a bearish indicator for near-term sales performance. What's next for Aehr Test Systems? For the remainder of the fiscal year, Aehr reiterated its previous guidance for sales of at least $70 million and an adjusted net profit before taxes margin of at least 10%. While management kept its guidance at previous levels, it also issued cautious commentary on the demand outlook for its products. CEO Gayn Erickson said that the growth outlook for silicon carbide products outside of China in 2025 would likely remain challenging before seeing improvement in 2026. But he also cautioned that geopolitical risks and other factors could hurt its ability to score wins in the Chinese market. On a positive note, the company does expect that testing products and other solutions for artificial intelligence processors will account for a substantial portion of its revenue this year.
