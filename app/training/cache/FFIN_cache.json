Mortgage income increased to $3.01 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $1.94 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 due to increased loan volume from the prior year.

Additionally, officer and employee salaries increased for additions to the middle market lending team and the audit and risk departments due to growth. Noninterest expenses, excluding salary related costs, increased $734 thousand for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 largely due to increases in software amortization and expense, occupancy expense and legal, tax and professional fees offset by a decrease in FDIC insurance premiums of $1.59 million due to the special assessment in the prior year. The Company's efficiency ratio was 46.81 percent for the fourth quarter of 2024 and 51.97 percent for the fourth quarter of 2023.

Ju Wenjun won the Women's Blitz Championship, beating Lei Tingjie in a nail-biting final. The tournament, which was held to celebrate 100 years of FIDE, took two years to organize and included both traditional and new ideas in chess. Chess and Business This year's World Blitz Championship was more than just a sporting event.

Timur Turlov, the CEO of Freedom Holding Corp. said: \"Chess is truly a language that everyone can understand. It is a game that is played all over the world and across many cultures, and it shows how important it is to find things that we have in common in a world where we are all more connected than ever before.\" Turlov also noted that trust is important in both chess and business: \"Trust, much like the king in chess, is the most important thing in our ecosystem. Without trust, everything else falls apart.\" \"Chess teaches us about strategy, trust, and resilience-qualities that are indispensable in both business and life. Supporting an event as big as this matches our mission to encourage growth and new ideas around the world,\" he commented. A Tournament for the Ages The Open section was a very exciting competition. The defending champion Magnus Carlsen played a seven-game tie-break final against Ian Nepomniachtchi. Even though they were both very tired after the tournament, the two players showed great sportsmanship by agreeing to share the title. The president of FIDE, Arkady Dvorkovich, agreed to this, which was a very rare thing in chess. In the Women's section, Ju Wenjun's victory over Lei Tingjie made it an all-Chinese final. \"This tournament has been both challenging and exciting,\" said Ju. Her resilience and skill epitomized the tenacity celebrated throughout the event. FIDE President's Remarks Arkady Dvorkovich, FIDE President, reflected on the tournament's significance: \"This championship showed that chess is popular all over the world.

three years ago editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Fri, Dec 27, 2024, 3:37 PM 3 min read In This Article: FFIN -0.86% In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But if you try your hand at stock picking, you risk returning less than the market. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term First Financial Bankshares, Inc. ( NASDAQ:FFIN ) shareholders, since the share price is down 28% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 25%. Even worse, it's down 13% in about a month, which isn't fun at all. It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. So let's do just that. See our latest analysis for First Financial Bankshares To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement. First Financial Bankshares saw its EPS decline at a compound rate of 3.5% per year, over the last three years. This reduction in EPS is slower than the 10% annual reduction in the share price. So it seems the market was too confident about the business, in the past. You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). NasdaqGS:FFIN Earnings Per Share Growth December 27th 2024 We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here. . What About Dividends? As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for First Financial Bankshares the TSR over the last 3 years was -23%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments! A Different Perspective First Financial Bankshares shareholders gained a total return of 21% during the year. But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 3% over half a decade This could indicate that the company is winning over new investors, as it pursues its strategy. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand First Financial Bankshares better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the 1 warning sign we've spotted with First Financial Bankshares .

Upgraded Credit Ratings Amidst Steady Growth and Strengthened Compliance ACCESS Newswire \u00b7 Freedom Holding Corp. Freedom Holding Corp. Fri, Dec 13, 2024, 6:00 PM 2 min read In This Article: FRHC +0.03% S&P Global Ratings has upgraded the credit ratings of four key subsidiaries of Freedom Holding Corp., the Nasdaq-listed U.S.-based diversified financial services company. The international rating agency has raised the long-term issuer credit ratings of Freedom Finance, a Kazakhstan-based market broker; Freedom Finance Global, a company providing access to international markets; Freedom Finance Europe, a European broker; and Freedom Bank Kazakhstan, from 'B' to 'B+' and affirmed their short-term ratings at 'B.' The rating of Freedom Holding Corp. itself was affirmed at 'B-' with a 'stable' outlook. \"This upgrade reflects the efforts and progress we've made in strengthening our operations and governance. Our focus on diversification, compliance and sustainable growth will continue to drive our success,\" Freedom Holding said in a statement. In addition, the national scale ratings for two of its subsidiaries were upgraded to 'kzBBB' from 'kzBBB-'. Freedom Holding operates the largest retail brokerage franchise in Kazakhstan and has a growing presence in Europe. The upgrades demonstrate the strength of the holding company. Freedom is also developing a comprehensive ecosystem in Kazakhstan and its businesses include insurance and lifestyle companies. The holding has streamlined traditionally complex processes, such as insurance claims and mortgages, and aims to build meaningful relationships with its customers. The company plans to expand internationally and continuously evaluates opportunities in emerging and developed markets while maintaining strict compliance policies. S&P also noted Freedom Finance's steady growth and geographic diversification of revenues, which is important for the company's capitalisation. The stable outlook reflects the analysts' confidence in the sustainable development of all holding structures and their financial stability. \"The holding is developing a risk management and compliance system within its complex structure with many subsidiaries in different jurisdictions.We expect that moderate business growth combined with strong earnings, diversified by sources and geographies, will help maintain Freedom's strong capitalization,\" the rating agency said. However, the report cautioned against too rapid franchise expansion as this could strain the holding company's ability to manage consolidated risks and potentially put pressure on its capitalisation. On the other hand, Freedom Holding's outlook could be upgraded in the future if it demonstrates effective risk management, expands cross-selling opportunities between its subsidiaries and consolidates its franchise while maintaining strong capitalization. Story Continues Freedom Holding Corp. provides financial services in 22 countries, including Kazakhstan, the United States, Cyprus, Poland, Spain, Uzbekistan and Armenia. Its head office is in New York.

It was a record revenue quarter for Freedom where we achieved a 33% increase in revenues as compared to the same quarter last year, and a 29% increase over our first quarter of fiscal 2025. Insurance underwriting was the primary revenue growth driver for the period, which was in line with our expectations as we continued to penetrate the Kazakhstan and other central Asian markets with innovative products and services, and continued the roll out of our Freedom SuperApp. We experienced an expansion of retail client activity across all key business segments and continued to garner market share in each area of operations. This was highlighted by a 33% and 58% customer-base increase in our banking and insurance segments, respectively,\" Turlov added. \"Of the $115 million in net income for the quarter, our brokerage and banking segments were the top contributors, coming in at $86 million and $46 million respectively, partially offset by a loss of $32 million in our Other business segment, which was also in keeping with our expectations as we continue to invest in these wholly owned subsidiaries,\" Turlov stated, and \"the significant increase in our insurance customer base during the quarter, accounted for $15 million of this net income. New insurance products and services such as pension annuity and accident insurance, coupled with an overall expansion of our insurance operations, were significant contributors to the financial results during the reporting period,\" Turlov continued. \"Our insurance customer base increased by 58% as compared to your fiscal 2024 year-end indicating to us that we continue to be on the right path of service offerings and value-add products for our clients,\" said the CEO. \"Staying ahead of the game\u2026\" Commenting further, Turlov stated, \"A key differentiator for Freedom Holding Corp. is in our ability to look ahead and identify low-competition, high-margin niches that others are unaware of, a task which is often easier said than done. Staying ahead of the game requires us to leverage the foundation of our digital ecosystem: an ecosystem that we have been building and improving over the course of the past 5 years. Millions of dollars and thousands of hours have been dedicated to this endeavor and the fruit of these investments and labors can be seen in the continued delivery of our positive financial results. One can't overestimate the power of the Freedom SuperApp, which allows us to accumulate massive amounts of data about our consumers' behavior and their preferences. This kind of Big Data is a significant competitive advantage as the more we know about our clients, the more rapidly we can create products and services that meet their specific needs. Trending data gives us foresight and we have been nimble and efficient enough to take advantage of this. Freedom Holding Corp. currently controls the largest ecosystem of financial services in Kazakhstan, including a bank, two brokerage companies, an insurance business and a payment service. All of these services can be accessed through the Freedom SuperApp. I expect that over the course of the next few years, we will be unmatched by our competitors in this regard,\" the CEO concluded.
