-1.69% ^GSPC -0.76% For Immediate Release Chicago, IL \u2013 January 16, 2025 \u2013 Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses West Fraser Timber Co. WFG, CalMaine Foods CALM, The Andersons, Inc. ANDE and Hydrofarm HYFM. Industry: Agriculture Products Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2397138/4-agriculture---products-stocks-to-watch-despite-industry-concerns The Zacks Agriculture - Products industry has been bearing the brunt of high input costs, labor shortages and supply-chain headwinds. The decline in commodity prices adds to the concerns. Nevertheless, increasing consumer awareness regarding food ingredients and the preference for healthier alternatives will support the industry. Alternative agricultural technologies like hydroponics and vertical farming are expected to be other key catalysts, given their inherent benefits. Companies like West Fraser Timber Co. , CalMaine Foods , The Andersons, Inc. and Hydrofarm are poised to gain from strong end-market demand and their ongoing strategic growth initiatives aimed at capitalizing on these trends. Industry Description The Zacks Agriculture \u2013 Products industry comprises companies that are either involved in storing agricultural commodities, distributing ingredients to others or engaged in farming crops, livestock and poultry products. Some are engaged in purchasing, storing, transporting, processing and selling agricultural commodities or products derived from the same. They operate grain elevators, wherein income is generated from commodities bought and sold using these elevators or held as inventory. Some companies provide nutrients, advanced indoor and greenhouse lighting, environmental control systems and accessories for hydroponic gardening, the method of growing plants using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent instead of soil. A few players offer innovative, plant-based health and wellness products. Companies producing lumber also fall under this industry. Trends Shaping the Future of the Agriculture - Products Industry Low Commodity Prices, High Costs Act as Woes : Agricultural commodity prices have been weighed in the past year by ample supply. Players in the industry are facing rising labor, packaging and distribution costs, among other expenses. The industry continues to navigate a tight labor market with a spike in wages and higher distribution costs. They have been making efforts to bolster their financial conditions, conserve cash and improve profitability by implementing pricing and cost-reduction actions, which are likely to help sustain margins in the future. Story Continues Solid Demand to Propel Industry Growth : The demand for food is directly influenced by population, demographic shifts and income growth. Per the United Nations, the global population is expected to grow to 8.6 billion in 2030 and 9.8 billion in 2050. This will drive a 50% increase in global food demand. Consumers are now focused on healthier food alternatives. To capitalize on this, several agricultural and food-based companies are investing in innovation and augmenting their product and market strategies to bring new quality and healthy food ingredients to the market. Ongoing improvements in grain-handling techniques and investment in larger storage spaces will likely support the industry. Given that food remains an essential commodity regardless of the condition of the economy, the industry benefits from stable earnings across economic cycles. Hydroponics & Cannabis are Key Catalysts : Hydroponics is gaining popularity as it gives growers control over nutrient delivery, light, air, water, humidity, pests and temperature in an indoor setting. This method enables faster crop growth, with higher yields than traditional soil-based cultivation. It is being utilized in new and emerging industries, including the cultivation of cannabis and hemp. Vertical farms producing organic fruits and vegetables also utilize hydroponics due to the shortage of farmland and environmental vulnerabilities. Vertical farming is the latest agricultural technology, wherein shelves and artificial lighting systems are used to grow produce, thereby minimizing land and water consumption. Total sales for the hydroponic equipment industry are projected to reach $67 billion by 2033. Even though the cannabis industry is undergoing a rough patch due to an oversupply, its long-term prospects remain intact. In the United States, several states have legalized cannabis for medical or recreational use, making it the largest market in the world. Spending on legal cannabis is projected to increase at a steady pace each year in North America and reach $57 billion by 2028. Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Prospects The Zacks Agriculture - Products industry is part of the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #174, which places it in the bottom 28% of the 242 Zacks industries. The group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak prospects in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry\u2019s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the downward earnings per share outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. In the past year, the industry's earnings estimates for 2024 have moved down 27%, and the same for 2025 has gone down 28%. Before we present a few Agriculture - Products stocks that investors can keep an eye on, it is worth looking at the industry\u2019s stock-market performance and valuation picture. Industry Versus Broader Market The Zacks Agriculture \u2013 Products industry has outperformed its sector but lagged the Zacks S&P 500 composite over the past 12 months. Stocks in this industry have moved up 1.4% in the past 12 months against the Basic Materials sector\u2019s 5.1% decline. The S&P 500 has gained 23.6% in the same time frame. Industry's Current Valuation On the basis of the forward 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio, a commonly used multiple for valuing Agriculture - Products stocks, we see that the industry is currently trading at 4.75X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 13.96X. The Basic Materials sector\u2019s forward 12-month EV/EBITDA is 6.64X. Over the last five years, the industry traded as high as 9.55X and as low as 3.54X, with the median being 4.69X. Four Agriculture - Products Stocks to Keep an Eye on West Fraser : The company has been witnessing solid demand for Oriented Strand Board, plywood and other engineered products in North America, driven by the home construction markets. Stabilization of inflation and interest rates, a significant portion of the population reaching the typical home buying stage and an aging U.S. housing stock are expected to aid new home construction and repair and renovation spending, thereby driving demand for WFG. The company\u2019s strategy of optimizing its portfolio through divestitures and mill curtailments is expected to contribute to earnings. West Fraser is also making significant capital investments to modernize its mills. Ongoing efforts to improve efficiency and lower costs will aid margins. With strong financial flexibility and a favorable cost position, West Fraser is well-positioned to maintain a competitive edge. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Vancouver, Canada-based company\u2019s earnings for 2025 indicates year-over-year growth of 507%. West Fraser has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 171%, on average. This diversified wood product company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here . CalMaine Foods : The company recently reported solid second-quarter fiscal 2025 results aided by robust demand and elevated egg prices. The outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in U.S. poultry flocks has boosted eggs, which bodes well for the company. The preference for specialty eggs (including cage-free eggs) continues to surge, driven by state mandates and consumer preference. Consumers are also willing to pay premium prices for these products. Specialty eggs, thus, remain a focal point for CalMaine Foods\u2019 growth strategy. It has earmarked $60 million in new capital projects for the expansion of cage-free capacity. The company is also expanding its product portfolio to include value-added egg products. This is evident in its investment in Meadowcreek Foods, LLC for hard-cooked eggs and Crepini Foods, a new venture offering egg products and prepared foods. CalMaine expects to leverage the Crepini brand of quality products, including egg wraps and protein pancakes, to extend its reach to major retailers. Ridgeland, MS-based CalMaine Foods is the largest producer and distributor of fresh shell eggs in the United States. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CALM\u2019s earnings for fiscal 2025 indicates year-over-year growth of 50%. CALM currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3. Andersons : Backed by its strong cash flow, the company continues to add to its core grain and fertilizer verticals, including a greater focus on renewables and opportunities in renewable diesel feedstocks. The renewables segment continues to deliver strong results and the current margin outlook remains strong. Production facilities operate efficiently with improved ethanol yield and lower operating costs, which is expected to boost margins. ANDE\u2019s long-term capital projects to lower the carbon intensity of ethanol plants are expected to lead to positive financial results. ANDE recently made a $85 million investment for a 65% ownership interest in Skyland Grain, LLC, which operates a large grain and agronomy footprint and is spread across Southwest Kansas, Eastern Colorado and the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles. These assets extend ANDE\u2019s geographic presence. Maumee, OH-based Andersons operates in trade, renewables and plant nutrient sectors in the United States and internationally. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ANDE\u2019s earnings for fiscal 2025 indicates year-over-year growth of 13.8%. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 43.2%, on average. ANDE currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3. Hydrofarm : The company is focused on streamlining operations, reducing costs and improving efficiencies. Aided by these efforts, HYFM has delivered gross margin expansion in five of the last six consecutive quarters. Major initiatives include narrowing the product and brand portfolio, relocating and consolidating certain manufacturing and distribution centers and selling assets related to the production of certain durable equipment products. Its strategic focus on proprietary brands continues to deliver mix benefits and operational efficiencies. The company has also been expanding its reach to serve non-cannabis controlled-environment applications, including food, floral and lawn and garden. Shoemakersville, PA-based Hydrofarm engages in the manufacturing and distribution of controlled-environment agriculture equipment and supplies in the United States and Canada. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HYFM\u2019s fiscal 2025 bottom line is pegged at a loss of 83 cents per share, indicating an improvement from the loss of $1.28 per share expected for 2024.

"4 Agriculture - Products Stocks to Watch Despite Industry Concerns Madhurima Das Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 7:35 PM 9 min read In This Article: ANDE -1.69% HYFM +0.03% ^GSPC -0.76% The Zacks Agriculture - Products industry has been bearing the brunt of high input costs, labor shortages and supply-chain headwinds. The decline in commodity prices adds to the concerns. Nevertheless, increasing consumer awareness regarding food ingredients and the preference for healthier alternatives will support the industry. Alternative agricultural technologies like hydroponics and vertical farming are expected to be other key catalysts, given their inherent benefits. Companies like West Fraser Timber Co. WFG, CalMaine Foods CALM, The Andersons, Inc. ANDE and Hydrofarm HYFM are poised to gain from strong end-market demand and their ongoing strategic growth initiatives aimed at capitalizing on these trends. Industry Description The Zacks Agriculture \u2013 Products industry comprises companies that are either involved in storing agricultural commodities, distributing ingredients to others or engaged in farming crops, livestock and poultry products. Some are engaged in purchasing, storing, transporting, processing and selling agricultural commodities or products derived from the same. They operate grain elevators, wherein income is generated from commodities bought and sold using these elevators or held as inventory. Some companies provide nutrients, advanced indoor and greenhouse lighting, environmental control systems and accessories for hydroponic gardening,\u00a0 the method of growing plants using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent instead of soil. A few players offer innovative, plant-based health and wellness products. Companies producing lumber also fall under this industry. Trends Shaping the Future of the Agriculture - Products Industry Low Commodity Prices, High Costs Act as Woes : Agricultural commodity prices have been weighed in the past year by ample supply. Players in the industry are facing rising labor, packaging and distribution costs, among other expenses. The industry continues to navigate a tight labor market with a spike in wages and higher distribution costs. They have been making efforts to bolster their financial conditions, conserve cash and improve profitability by implementing pricing and cost-reduction actions, which are likely to help sustain margins in the future. Solid Demand to Propel Industry Growth : The demand for food is directly influenced by population, demographic shifts and income growth. Per the United Nations, the global population is expected to grow to 8.6 billion in 2030 and 9.8 billion in 2050. This will drive a 50% increase in global food demand. Consumers are now focused on healthier food alternatives. To capitalize on this, several agricultural and food-based companies are investing in innovation and augmenting their product and market strategies to bring new quality and healthy food ingredients to the market. Ongoing improvements in grain-handling techniques and investment in larger storage spaces will likely support the industry. Given that food remains an essential commodity regardless of the condition of the economy, the industry benefits from stable earnings across economic cycles. Story Continues Hydroponics & Cannabis are Key Catalysts : Hydroponics is gaining popularity as it gives growers control over nutrient delivery, light, air, water, humidity, pests and temperature in an indoor setting. This method enables faster crop growth, with higher yields than traditional soil-based cultivation. It is being utilized in new and emerging industries, including the cultivation of cannabis and hemp. Vertical farms producing organic fruits and vegetables also utilize hydroponics due to the shortage of farmland and environmental vulnerabilities. Vertical farming is the latest agricultural technology, wherein shelves and artificial lighting systems are used to grow produce, thereby minimizing land and water consumption. Total sales for the hydroponic equipment industry are projected to reach $67 billion by 2033. Even though the cannabis industry is undergoing a rough patch due to an oversupply, its long-term prospects remain intact. In the United States, several states have legalized cannabis for medical or recreational use, making it the largest market in the world. Spending on legal cannabis is projected to increase at a steady pace each year in North America and reach $57 billion by 2028.

Four Agriculture - Products Stocks to Keep an Eye on West Fraser : The company has been witnessing solid demand for Oriented Strand Board, plywood and other engineered products in North America, driven by the home construction markets. Stabilization of inflation and interest rates, a significant portion of the population reaching the typical home buying stage and an aging U.S. housing stock are expected to aid new home construction and repair and renovation spending, thereby driving demand for WFG. The company\u2019s strategy of optimizing its portfolio through divestitures and mill curtailments is expected to contribute to earnings. West Fraser is also making significant capital investments to modernize its mills. Ongoing efforts to improve efficiency and lower costs will aid margins. With strong financial flexibility and a favorable cost position, West Fraser is well-positioned to maintain a competitive edge. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Vancouver, Canada-based company\u2019s earnings for 2025 indicates year-over-year growth of 507%. West Fraser has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 171%, on average. This diversified wood product company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).

Price & Consensus: : WFG CalMaine Foods : The company recently reported solid second-quarter fiscal 2025 results aided by robust demand and elevated egg prices. The outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in U.S. poultry flocks has boosted eggs, which bodes well for the company. The preference for specialty eggs (including cage-free eggs) continues to surge, driven by state mandates and consumer preference. Consumers are also willing to pay premium prices for these products. Specialty eggs, thus, remain a focal point for CalMaine Foods\u2019 growth strategy. It has earmarked $60 million in new capital projects for the expansion of cage-free capacity. The company is also expanding its product portfolio to include value-added egg products. This is evident in its investment in Meadowcreek Foods, LLC for hard-cooked eggs and Crepini Foods, a new venture offering egg products and prepared foods. CalMaine expects to leverage the Crepini brand of quality products, including egg wraps and protein pancakes, to extend its reach to major retailers. Ridgeland, MS-based CalMaine Foods is the largest producer and distributor of fresh shell eggs in the United States. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CALM\u2019s earnings for fiscal 2025 indicates year-over-year growth of 50%. CALM currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3. Price & Consensus: CALM Andersons : Backed by its strong cash flow, the company continues to add to its core grain and fertilizer verticals, including a greater focus on renewables and opportunities in renewable diesel feedstocks. The renewables segment continues to deliver strong results and the current margin outlook remains strong. Production facilities operate efficiently with improved ethanol yield and lower operating costs, which is expected to boost margins. ANDE\u2019s long-term capital projects to lower the carbon intensity of ethanol plants are expected to lead to positive financial results. ANDE recently made a $85 million investment for a 65% ownership interest in Skyland Grain, LLC, which operates a large grain and agronomy footprint and is spread across Southwest Kansas, Eastern Colorado and the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles. These assets extend ANDE\u2019s geographic presence. Maumee, OH-based Andersons operates in trade, renewables and plant nutrient sectors in the United States and internationally. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ANDE\u2019s earnings for fiscal 2025 indicates year-over-year growth of 13.8%. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 43.2%, on average. ANDE currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3. Price & Consensus: ANDE Hydrofarm : The company is focused on streamlining operations, reducing costs and improving efficiencies. Aided by these efforts, HYFM has delivered gross margin expansion in five of the last six consecutive quarters. Major initiatives include narrowing the product and brand portfolio, relocating and consolidating certain manufacturing and distribution centers and selling assets related to the production of certain durable equipment products. Its strategic focus on proprietary brands continues to deliver mix benefits and operational efficiencies. The company has also been expanding its reach to serve non-cannabis controlled-environment applications, including food, floral and lawn and garden. Shoemakersville, PA-based Hydrofarm engages in the manufacturing and distribution of controlled-environment agriculture equipment and supplies in the United States and Canada. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HYFM\u2019s fiscal 2025 bottom line is pegged at a loss of 83 cents per share, indicating an improvement from the loss of $1.28 per share expected for 2024.

Thank you for joining our fiscal second quarter, 2025 conference call. I want to start by expressing gratitude to our employees for their continued hard work and service and supporting our mission of providing purpose built infrastructure to the rapidly growing high performance computing industry. Before turning the call over to our CFO, Saidal Mohmand for a detailed review of our financial results. I'd like to share some recent developments across our businesses. Starting with our data center hosting business. We currently have 286 megawatts of data center capacity for our Cryptocurrency clients across two fully contracted locations in North Dakota which are operating at full capacity. As many of you know, Bitcoin recently hit $100,000 and the demand for our services in this sector remains robust. Next, let's discuss our cloud services business which provides high performance computing power for AI applications. This segment continues to experience growth as we fulfill our existing contracts and explore new opportunities in our pipeline. As at the end of the second quarter, we had six clusters online. We are currently evaluating numerous opportunities in this area as we see how next generation GPUS come to market in our HPC hosting segment. We continue construction of a 400 megawatt campus in Ellendale, North Dakota in December. We reached a major milestone with the successful energization of the main substation transformer. Additionally, I'm very pleased to announce that we won the DCD Community Impact Award for Ellendale Community and Economic Development Initiative through the our wish program we're addressing housing shortages and supporting workforce growth in Allendale, North Dakota. This is a significant accomplishment for an emerging firm like ours in the data center space as we were finalists alongside established companies from around the globe such as Google NTT, Data from India and Telehouse Europe based in London. Let's now turn to the topic that's on everyone's mind the lease of our campus in Ellendale, North Dakota. Over the past year, we've learned that the hyperscaler contract process is extremely thorough while we cannot control their speed. We are focusing on what we can't control completing the construction of a 100 megawatt data center on time and within budget, I strongly believe that our Ellendale campus is a valuable asset with 100 megawatts of critical it load available in 2025. We believe it is in our shareholders' best interest to continue managing what we can and avoid speculating on an exact date while the process has been long. One of the major benefits of undergoing such a significant diligence process is that we have been engaged with some of the largest finance and investment partners in the world today. I'm excited to share, we've agreed to form a strategic partnership with Macquarie Asset Management. Macquarie Asset Management, the asset management division of Macquarie Group is a global financial services organization operating in 34 markets with over 20,000 employees. They have been recognized as one of the largest infrastructure investors in the world for the past 12 years. Raising over $80 billion in capital. Last year alone, Macquarie brings extensive experience in infrastructure investment and data centers. They will leverage their infrastructure investing and development expertise along with our growing digital, along with their growing digital ecosystem capabilities to complement applied digital expertise in delivering and servicing data center infrastructure solutions for enterprise and hypers steel companies. The partnership will include a $5 billion perpetual preferred equity financing facility. This facility will allocate up to $900 million to the company, Alldale high performance computing data center campus and give Macquarie the right of first refusal to invest up to an additional $4.1 billion across to apply digital's future HPC data center pipeline. The investment will take the form of perpetual preferred and 15% common equity interest and apply digital's HPC business segment. Macquarie investment in conjunction with future project financing will be used to repay we repaid project level debt and allow the company to recover over an estimated $300 million of equity investment in the L&L HPC campus. We believe this expanded relationship with Malory positions applied digital for significant growth in the industry. Establishing applied digital is one of the fastest growing HPC data center owners operators and developers in the United States. At today's build cost, we have a significant portion of the equity needed to construct over two gigawatts of HPC data center capacity including our L&L HPC campus with an 85% ownership stake in both existing and future HPC assets to a project level preferred equity financing facility sufficient to fund our HPC project pipeline. We believe we are positioned for transformative progress. We're excited to have Macquarie support as we establish ourselves as a leader in the tier three data center infrastructure sector while continuing to develop and operate large scale state of the art data centers for low class customers at the forefront of the A I revolution. In summary, we are encouraged by the positive trends. We are witnessing across our business and remain confident in our growth trajectory. With that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Saidal to walk you through our financials and provide an update on guidance. Is that all? Saidal Mohmand Thanks, Wes and good afternoon everyone. It has been an active few months for our finance and accounting teams and I am delighted to lead the department as a new CFO. Let me begin by highlighting some of our recent financial announcements followed by killed. Wesley Cummins Overview of the quarter. Saidal Mohmand In November. We completed a $450 million 2.75% convertible senior note offering due 2030 which included all84 millionocated for share repurchases in December. We announced a $150 million senior secured debt financing facility with Macquarie Equipment capital and simultaneously repaid our senior credit facility with SIM Group. This allowed us to remove encumbrances on assets as well as the parent guarantee. Today, we announced a strategic partnership with Macquarie asset management for a $5 billion potential referred a financing facility. Now let's turn to the quarter revenues for the fiscal second quarter of 2025 were $63.9 million. Up 51% over the prior comparable period. This increase was primarily driven by the continued growth of our cloud services business due to the deployment of additional GP U clusters in total, our data center hosting segment generated $36.2 million in revenue. While our cloud services segment contributed $27.7 million. Cost of revenues increased $22.6 million to $52.4 million from the prior comparable period, primarily driven by the growth in the business as more facilities were energized and additional services were provided to customers GA expense increased $9.5 million to $29.8 million also driven by growth in the business as more facilities were energized and additional services were provided this quarter, our depreciation amortization expense increased to $26.4 million compared to $13.4 million in the same period of 2024 of this amount, $21.7 million is attributable to to DNA in our cloud segment. This segment's DNA was primarily driven by the amortization of our GPU leases over a two year period which we have discussed in previous earnings calls during the quarter, we renegotiated our GP U lease terms which allowed us to extend the amortization period for GPU leases to a more industry standard timeline of five years. This segment, this adjustment reduced segment DN Aans by $8.5 million for this quarter. Looking ahead, we expect this change to further lower DNA expenses by about $7 million per quarter on a GAAP reported basis. All then going forward, we expect to recognize around $15 million per quarter in the cloud segment for the DNA. Moving on to interest expense, interest expense increased $4.9 million to $7.5 million. Primarily driven by an increase in finance leases and interest bearing loans between periods. Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $138.7 million or $0.66 on a basic and diluted share. I want to note that this quarter was impacted by the loss and conversion of debt of $25.4 million as convertible debt issued to YA fund was converted during the period. We also recognize the loss on change in the fair value debt of $87.2 million due to adjustments, the fair value of the 2.75% convertible senior nodes during the two week period in which the conversion option was recorded as a derivative. This was prior to us receiving shareholder approval at the annual meeting on November 20th. 2024 to increase our authorized share count, the adjusted net loss was $12.6 million or $0.06 per share. Just the increased 93% to $21.4 million as well. Moving to our balance sheet, we ended the fiscal second quarter with $314.6 million of cash, cash equivalent and restricted cash along with $479.6 million in debt. With that, I'll turn over the call to Wes for closing remarks. Wesley Cummins Thank you said all the rapid expansion of hyperscale data centers driven by growing demand for AI capabilities is presenting significant challenges to the electricity availability in the US. According to a recent Morgan Stanley report, there could be a shortfall of approximately 36 gigawatts in power available for us data centers by 2028. Addressing this issue is not straightforward as adding new capacity requires lengthy planning, regulatory approvals and the development of new generation and transmission infrastructure processes that can span years or even decades based on these dynamics. We believe that much of the US is currently available. Excess power could be under contract within the next few years applied. Digital was one of the first companies to recognize this growing demand for power and data centers anticipating these needs. We began construction of our facilities before the market fully grasped the shifting demand landscape. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on these trends. Our strategy has been further validated over the past year by securing strategic investments from S group NVIDIA and now Macquarie Asset Management. These investments not only validate our vision and approach but also lower our cost of capital and accelerate the development of our pipeline, transforming it into a highly valuable asset for our shareholders. Our vision is to establish a platform for building and operating multiple HPC data centers and we're proud of the significant progress achieved this quarter and look forward to sharing further updates as the year unfolds. We welcome your questions at this time. Operator. Question and Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions) Nick Giles B. Riley security. Nick Giles Thank you very much, operator. Western team. Congratulations on today's announcement. In the release, you noted late stage discussions with multiple hyperscalers. And I was wondering, can you provide any color on where due diligence processes stand with the other potential hyperscalers at this point? My next question is would, would there come a point where you would reenter exclusivity with any of these counterparties. Thank you very much. Wesley Cummins Nick. Thanks for the question. So I think we disclosed in October or November. You know that we had the exclusivity with the first potential customer had expired. We opened up the site for additional customers to look. You know, those are in varying stages of progress. But it's once I would say is once it's been done, once everything is prepared for easy access on when you're, when you're doing the diligence around, technical, the design, fiber power, all of those things, so much, much more accelerated you know, progression of, of those. And does that answer your question. Nick Giles That that does, that's very helpful. May maybe just a follow up one on the Macquarie investment. How long have you been looking at similar deals? And to what extent did terms improve over that over that timeline? Thank you very much. Wesley Cummins So we started this process last year, it's, it's been probably seven months. We looked at multiple proposals and I think it's because the market developed and the, and the year moved on and the progress that we've made at our site. You know, we, I think signed the best terms and I'm very happy with the outcome on the terms we did with this structure, with Macquarie. But, but we did, do a full process to make sure that we were getting, the a the best partner and the best terms. Nick Giles Appreciate all the color continued. Best of luck. Wesley Cummins Thanks, Nick. Operator Rob Brown, Lake Street Capital. Robert Brown Good afternoon. Just a little further on the hypers scalar discussions. I know you can't exactly protect but are they, are they kind of moving forward? Are you, you're looking through final details? Or are there kind of roadblocks that you run into just some sense of maybe where it's at and, and what's left to go? Wesley Cummins Hey, Rob, thanks. What, what I would say about it? I think the best way to frame this is, the experience we have had thus far, again, very thorough process. We've done great, like from a design technical perspective, fiber, the work we've done there and what's going into into that site specifically all ande power, all of that has been great and made, made a huge amount of progress on that. I think with our, the announcement today, we're hitting really one of the last piece of the puzzle for us, which is, I think I've communicated this before we, while we have this, I think the demand for this capacity again, I don't know of anything of this scale available in 2025 is going to allow us to break into full stack development and operations in the in the hyperscale market. But the last piece here is, we're new, we're new, we're first time supplier to any of these hyperscalers and the financial backing from a very well known partner with a lot of capital I think is really helpful in checking the box for the last hurdle we need to get over. But I'm I'm really optimistic about finalizing a lease on that facility and then moving on to the next level. Robert Brown Okay. Got it. And, and then, with this funding are there, I guess the next facilities and the, and the funding backing for, I guess an additional $4 billion plus. How, how does that kind of open up the marketplace? How does that accelerate maybe some of these other discussions you're having. Wesley Cummins Again? I think just that the backing in general, right? There's the full amount of due diligence. There's a reason that that we both wanted to enter into this partnership. We have a great power pipeline with a great data center development team, great ops team. And, and so as we finalize this first and we have a significant amount of 2026 power available. That's the next step as far as marketing across three different locations and what this really does for us. Well, and it's a, I think this is really important is it funds? I've talked about this for, I think our last two or three earnings calls we really needed to move, find financing and funding down to the asset level. This is an asset, heavy business, a CapEx, heavy business and this is a huge step in moving that down to the asset level. So every time we start a new campus, every time we get a new contract, there's not the question mark of where do you get the equity? How much dilution comes at the public company? It just lays a very clear road map between the equity commitment and then project finance on the debt side that will be layered on top of that to allow us to go out and build. As we said in the prepared remarks, over two gigawatts of the pipeline, which is what we have in the near term, 25, 26, 27 pipeline to go and build out. But I think the important part here is it provides a very clear road map of how we plan to finance that. Robert Brown Okay, great. Thank you. I'll turn it over. Operator Darren Aftahi, Roth capital partners. Darren Aftahi Hey guys, two. If I may just on the Macquarie announcement this morning, is there anything strategic in terms of the process and timing as it relates to the lease? And then I know you guys already hit this, the multiple hyperscaler and pr is there a scenario where that 400 megawatts in Allendale could get lit amongst two or is, are you kind of down the path of, of one is going to take all the capacity? Thanks. Wesley Cummins I think on the first question, is really about getting, to the right terms and you know, I'm not going to get into whether there's, there's any anything else as far as the timing around that? On the second question, it could split. I strongly believe it's going to be a single customer for the entire campus. Darren Aftahi Thanks. Operator Mike Grondahl, Northland Securities. Mike Grondahl Hey, guys, thanks. Could you remind us exactly how much money you had invested in Ellendale HPC? And, how much you'll be able to pull out with this Macquarie financing? Wesley Cummins Yeah, I'll call that all into that. Saidal Mohmand Hey, Mike. So a as we disclose in the in the, in the AK, we have roughly over $700 million invested in the Ellendale campus and assuming project financing on terms entered along with the lead. We expect in access of $300 million of cash proceeds that we can take back up to the parent. Wesley Cummins But Mike, I think it's important just as a reminder, we have the Macquarie Capital facility there, there's some, there's the extra debt that's going to be paid back as well. So when you're trying to do the math between the $700 million then what we pull out, there's there is that, that debt repayment. Saidal Mohmand Effectively for for the Allendale campus view it as the applied requirement on a megawatt basis of one of $1 million per megawatt from applied. And that will decrease to 750,000 going forward outside the Allendale campus. Mike Grondahl Right? So of the $700 million or over $700 million you have invested in Ellendale, you'll end up with a net $400 million with that $180 million of debt paid off and then you'll pull out some other capital. So your net investment is about $400 million there. Saidal Mohmand There's also, it's also a moving target to think about it, right? We're spending, we're putting dollars into the ground every month in the, in the project as well. Wesley Cummins Yeah, I a moving target as far as what we'll be able to pull back out. Yeah, the cash comes, comes back out of the, what is, what is now the HPC subsidiary and goes back to the, to the public parent code. Mike Grondahl Okay. And then two more questions. One wes if you could maybe define your pipeline right now, It looks like Macquarie can fund, two gigawatts, do you after the $400 million how much more do you have or can you get your hands on? And then secondly, if you could, I don't know maybe just demand sounds pretty good with all these hyper scalar. But what, what's the pricing environment look like? Wesley Cummins So I'll answer the second first so that, the pricing environment is is reflective of the demand environment. And I think there's plenty of data points just even in the last few weeks about data center spend from some of the hyperscalers that that is a strong indicator of where the demand of the market remains and then go to the to the pipeline Mike. We've talked about, we talked about this on our last call. We have other campuses. I think that the total is 1.6. So that's the two outside of Ellendale, 1.6 of campuses that where we have 2026 hour and 2027 power. So that those are the ones that in some case, we've already been in market with those campuses. Mike Grondahl So outside of Ellendale 16 and you can have that available 26 or 27. Wesley Cummins Like building all of that, you can't build it all for 27 but first power available in 26. And at this point that that's really, all that matters if you haven't started building, now you're not having 2025 power. So this, this is really looking at 26 for the other campuses. Mike Grondahl Got it. Thank you. Operator George Sutton, Craig Colen. George Sutton Thank you and congratulations on the Macquarie deal today. So I'm curious, I what I understand timing is challenging to predict but in the facility it looks like there is a February 15, 2025 we signing date. That is necessary for this. Can you just address that specific date? Wesley Cummins Yeah, so, thanks short, but the, so the fed 2015 is not a lease signing date. I'll have to go back and look, but I think that outside date is maybe in June. But, but the F-15 is for completion of of some other items, but it's, it's not a lease signature date. George Sutton And just so we can define this for everybody. My belief is and correct me if I'm wrong, this is effectively the infrastructure equity component going forward. So you would go get a traditional construction loan financing for a large percentage underneath that would be the infrastructure equity. That is a fair, fairly significant portion of the rest of that. That's what this represents. Correct. Wesley Cummins That, that, that's exactly it. So I think, important to delineate here between the equity component, which is what this deal is and then the debt component, which is, project finance and then, in the future flips into an A BS or another debt instrument. So, if you want to look at total capital, that would be available when you match that equity with debt, right? There's a, there's a big multiplier effect there. George Sutton Understand. And then lastly, if I could just understand the 15% ownership that mcquary takes on of the HPC business, what what investment are they making for that? Is that the initial 200 ish million or is there a requirement for them to fund a specific portion of the $5 billion in total? Wesley Cummins So, George, the way. Saidal Mohmand To think about it, it's basically lease by lease. Each asset will go into what we deem what we call the box of the H BC company AP L DH. So any asset that goes into that entity, they will own 15% off and assuming that that goes on, they set the lease and then it's funded simultaneously entering. Wesley Cummins So any asset that they fund goes into the entity, so it's it's asset by asset, the drop it. George Sutton Beautiful. Okay. So if they don't choose to support a specific project that would not contain the equity in. Wesley Cummins That case, that's correct. George Sutton Okay, great clarity. Thank you guys. Wesley Cummins Thanks George. Operator Brett Knoblauch, Cantor Fitzgerald. Brett Knoblauch Hi guys. Thanks for taking my, my question and correct on the answer this morning on the Rofer, I, is that just a Rofer on the Perpetual Preferreds or would you have to use that before? Say you wanted to raise a traditional equity through a secondary or you have to use the preferred before you can go down that route. Wesley Cummins So it's think of it at two different levels. So we want to finance everything at the asset level with the preferred anything up at all at the top companies you're talking about like our public equity that there's nothing on that and, and if that's not what you meant, then please correct me. Brett Knoblauch I think that answers it. And then just another question, it says it's kind of Macquarie will receive preferred in common. I guess how many shares of common are they getting? And how does that mechanism work? Wesley Cummins So it's just 15% of the HPC subsidiary. Brett Knoblauch So not like common of the parent. Wesley Cummins Not, not common to the parent, 15% of the HPC subcu. Brett Knoblauch Understood. Perfect. And then just maybe just on the terms 12.75% on the dividend. I guess you guys talked about, lease terms ranging in the yield on cost range of, called low to mid 10s, which is more or less the cost of capital here on the preferred equity side. Have you seen terms improved to a level where you would get a yield on cost above the cost of the preferred? Wesley Cummins Yeah, so, but, but, but just remember that the preferred is a sliver of the capital and then the remainder of the capitals are equity in the site and then project level finance, which you know is the so for plus, 250 or 225. So when you look at the blended cost, we fully expect the return to be well worth of our cost of capital. Brett Knoblauch Perfect. Thank. You so much guys, really appreciate. George Sutton It. Operator [Brian Ban], Needham and co. Great. Thanks guys, you mentioned there's been some learnings on the delivered approach, hyperscales take what's, what's one of those learnings you can apply to the next set of negotiations, some of which may be ongoing. Wesley Cummins Yeah, so just, the preparation of, everything that we need to provide going through the process, like I said, it was much more accelerated with anyone else because we have all the, we have the knowledge base of what is being looked for, potential change for things in the future as far as you know, design and, there's a constant evolution, especially on cooling. So there's, there's that aspect and then, I think one of the biggest is, just I'll call it being stamped, right? Just getting through the process, signing a lease being stamped by, one of these types of customers that that we have the ability, to do all of these things. I think that's going to help accelerate it you know, one of, one of the things that we have learned is first time supplier. You, it always is going to take longer than if you're already a supplier to that company. And that you shouldn't be, I guess a big surprise, but it's just the delta between existing supplier and first time is a little bit larger than we thought. Thank you. Operator Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to pass it back to Wes Cummins for closing remarks. Wesley Cummins Thank you. Thanks everyone for joining our Q2 Fiscal 2025 conference call. Look forward to speaking with everyone in April. Operator Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

(ANDE) the Best Potash Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds? Mashaid Ahmed Sun, Jan 12, 2025, 3:11 PM 5 min read In This Article: ANDE -1.69% We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Potash Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Andersons, Inc. (NASDAQ: ANDE ) stands against other best potash stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Potash is a group of minerals and chemicals that contain potassium, a vital nutrient for plants and animals. The term refers to compounds including potassium sulfate, potassium-magnesium sulfate, potassium nitrate, potassium carbonate, potassium oxide, and potassium chloride. Among these, potassium chloride (KCl), also known as muriate of potash (MOP), is the most commonly produced and used form of potash. Potash is primarily used to produce fertilizers, which are essential for plant growth and development. Fertilizers containing potash help to support plant growth, increase crop yield, and enhance disease resistance. Additionally, potash helps to improve water preservation, making it an indispensable supplement to the natural nutrient content of soils. Soils often lack these essential nutrients, or growing crops have depleted them, making potash a necessary addition to maintain soil fertility. With approximately 95% of potash being used in fertilizers, its role in agriculture cannot be emphasized enough. The remaining 5% is used in the production of potassium-bearing chemicals, such as detergents, ceramics, pharmaceuticals, water conditioners, and alternatives to de-icing salt.

Potash is mined from underground deposits, either through conventional underground ore mining or by injecting water into the underground ore body and extracting the resulting brine.\u00a0 According to a report by the Canadian Government, potash production was estimated at 67.5 million tonnes globally in 2023, with Canada contributing 32.4% of the global supply. Canada, Russia, and Belarus dominate global potash production and accounted for 65.9% of the total in 2023. Canada is the world\u2019s largest producer and exporter of potash, with 11 active mines in Saskatchewan, producing 21.9 million tonnes and exporting 22.8 million tonnes in 2023, which accounts for over 41% of global exports. Potash prices have fluctuated over the years, declining from 2013 to 2016 and remaining relatively low until 2020. However, in 2021, prices rose sharply due to strong demand, and the surge continued into 2022, peaking at $1,202 per tonne in April, driven by geopolitical tensions and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. By June 2023, prices had fallen to $328 per tonne as global supply concerns subsided. Story Continues Potash is a vital nutrient for plants and animals, and its importance in fertilizers cannot be overstated. As the world\u2019s population continues to grow, the demand for potash is likely to increase. Is The Andersons, Inc. (ANDE) the Best Potash Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

Prove Temporary Given Strong Fundamentals? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Tue, Jan 7, 2025, 1:58 PM 3 min read In This Article: ANDE -1.69% Andersons (NASDAQ:ANDE) has had a rough three months with its share price down 18%. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study Andersons' ROE in this article. Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Andersons How Is ROE Calculated? The formula for return on equity is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Andersons is: 13% = US$195m \u00f7 US$1.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024). The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.13 in profit. What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth? Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. Andersons' Earnings Growth And 13% ROE To start with, Andersons' ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 15%. This probably goes some way in explaining Andersons' significant 33% net income growth over the past five years amongst other factors. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio. We then compared Andersons' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 14% in the same 5-year period. NasdaqGS:ANDE Past Earnings Growth January 7th 2025 The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Andersons''s valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio , as compared to its industry. Story Continues Is Andersons Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits? Andersons' ' three-year median payout ratio is on the lower side at 25% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (75%) of its profits. So it looks like Andersons is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth. Additionally, Andersons has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Summary In total, we are pretty happy with Andersons' performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals? Click here to be taken to our analyst's forecasts page for the company.

(ANDE) Is One of the Best Ethanol Stocks to Invest in Now? Mashaid Ahmed Sun, Dec 22, 2024, 6:06 PM 6 min read In This Article: ANDE -1.69% We recently published a list of 11 Best Ethanol Stocks To Invest In Now . In this article, we are going to look at where The Andersons, Inc. (NASDAQ: ANDE )\u00a0stands against other best ethanol stocks to invest in now. Ethanol, also known as ethyl alcohol, is a renewable fuel that can be naturally produced through the fermentation of sugars by yeasts, or it can be man-made through petrochemical processes. Ethanol can be utilized for various applications, but it is majorly used in the US as a gasoline additive in the transportation sector to enhance fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. According to the latest data released by the US Energy Information Administration on December 18, US fuel ethanol production saw a significant increase of more than 2% during the week ending December 13. At the same time, fuel ethanol stocks experienced a slight decline, while exports surged by nearly 33%. A Catalyst for the Ethanol Industry The E15 fuel blend, which contains 15% ethanol was restricted due to concerns about increased smog pollution in hot weather. However, earlier in 2024, the E15 fuel blend was temporarily approved in 49 states for the summer and the US government allowed the year-round E15 sales by 2025 only in certain Midwestern states. These regulatory changes boosted the ethanol industry margins as retailers sought to offer lower-cost fuel to consumers. On December 17, a US government funding bill included a provision allowing year-round sales of gasoline with a higher ethanol blend, specifically E15. This inclusion represents a significant victory for the corn and ethanol industries, which have long advocated for the expansion of E15 sales to boost demand for their products. The plan also provides credits to some refiners for compliance with the US Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a mandate requiring refiners to blend billions of gallons of biofuels into the nation\u2019s fuel supply or purchase credits from those that do. The biofuels industry has welcomed this provision, with Geoff Cooper, President of the Renewable Fuels Association, expressing hope that the funding bill would be swiftly enacted. CoBank Report: U.S. Ethanol Production to Remain Steady According to a report by CoBank, published on December 12, the US ethanol production in 2025 is expected to remain largely unchanged from 2024 levels, with the industry facing significant political and regulatory uncertainties. The report highlights that while the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts that ethanol production will average about 1.05 million barrels per day in 2025, the sector is navigating several challenges, including policy uncertainty surrounding the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program, small refinery exemptions (SREs), and the potential impact of tariffs. Story Continues The report notes that the incoming Trump administration is likely to take a cautious approach to proposing new RFS renewable volume obligations (RVOs) for 2026-2029, preferring to wait for actions on pending SREs. During the previous Trump administration, 34 SREs were granted for the 2017 RFS compliance year, whereas the Biden administration has not approved any SREs and has denied 79 SRE petitions to date. This contrast in policy approaches adds to the regulatory uncertainty facing the industry. Despite these challenges, the report identifies some positive trends, particularly in the area of global demand for ethanol. CoBank emphasizes that expanding renewable blending requirements in countries around the world are contributing to a growing global demand for ethanol. US ethanol exports are projected to set a new volume record in 2024, with Canada emerging as the top destination. However, the potential for trade policy changes, including the imposition of tariffs on world trading partners and retaliatory tariffs on US agricultural products, including ethanol and distillers\u2019 dried grains (DDGs), could limit export growth. Additionally, the expansion of corn ethanol production in Brazil may increase competition in the global market, further impacting US ethanol exports. With the ethanol industry facing a mix of regulatory changes, global demand shifts, and political uncertainties, the sector is poised for significant developments in the coming years. However, the potential for increased global demand offers promising opportunities for growth. Why The Andersons, Inc. (ANDE) Is One of The Best Ethanol Stocks To Invest In Now?

Its Dividend Of $0.195 editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Tue, Dec 17, 2024, 1:32 PM 2 min read In This Article: ANDE -1.69% The Andersons, Inc. ( NASDAQ:ANDE ) will pay a dividend of $0.195 on the 23rd of January. The dividend yield will be 1.7% based on this payment which is still above the industry average. See our latest analysis for Andersons Andersons' Projected Earnings Seem Likely To Cover Future Distributions Impressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. However, prior to this announcement, Andersons' dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business. The next year is set to see EPS grow by 9.0%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 21%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend. NasdaqGS:ANDE Historic Dividend December 17th 2024 Andersons Has A Solid Track Record The company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from $0.44 total annually to $0.76. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 5.6% per annum over that time. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained. The Dividend Looks Likely To Grow Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Andersons has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 26% per annum. A low payout ratio gives the company a lot of flexibility, and growing earnings also make it very easy for it to grow the dividend. Andersons Looks Like A Great Dividend Stock Overall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock. Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Are management backing themselves to deliver performance?
