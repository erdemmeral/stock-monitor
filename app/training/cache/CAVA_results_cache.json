This Chart Might Change Your Mind. Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 12:35 PM 3 min read In This Article: CAVA +1.68% CMG +0.02% Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA) stock was a breakout winner last year as the market cap of the Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant chain more than doubled on blistering growth. The numbers the company is generating right now are reminiscent of Chipotle Mexican Grill , the leader and pioneer in fast casual, and Cava's average unit volumes, or average sales per restaurant, are already approaching Chipotle levels. However, after soaring through most of 2024, Cava's stock price pulled back following the release of its third-quarter earnings report in mid-November, seemingly due to valuation concerns as its results were strong. Even after a rebound this month, the stock trades down 17% from its earlier peak. On one level, the stock does look expensive, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio above 200, but if you take a closer look at the numbers, you might find that Cava isn't quite as expensive as you thought. As you can see from the chart below, analysts have rapidly revised their earnings estimates higher for the company, showing they've consistently underestimated it. Data by YCharts . Analysts' consensus forecasts for 2024's earnings tripled over the course of the year, and they could be underestimating the stock going into 2025 as well. The consensus call for 2025 is that earnings per share will rise from $0.50 to $0.64. If Cava continues to deliver strong comparable sales growth -- comps were up 18.1% in the third quarter -- and continues to open new restaurants, it's likely to top that forecast. However, there's another reason that Cava stock isn't as expensive as it might look. The chain is still small, with just 352 locations as of the end of the third quarter. Compare that to Chipotle's more than 3,000 locations. Cava is aiming to have more than 1,000 restaurants open by the end of the decade, but the chain could grow well beyond that over the long term. Given its recent results, there appears to be a lot of room for growth ahead, and profit margins should expand as its operations scale up. There's more to the Cava story than a high share price.

(CAVA): Among the High Growth Restaurant Stocks for 2025 Jabran Kundi Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 3:03 PM 3 min read In This Article: CAVA +1.68% We recently compiled a list of the 10 High Growth Restaurant Stocks For 2025 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where CAVA Group, Inc. (NYSE:CAVA) stands against the other high growth restaurant stocks. Morgan Stanley recently published a report on the restaurant industry, suggesting that the tough environment that the industry is currently facing may ease out in 2025, though only modestly. Restaurants will have to continue working on providing value meals to consumers who continue to struggle to balance their income and expenses. A balanced job market could help keep labor costs steady. However, a political campaign against immigration could be a potential headwind for the industry. A growing emphasis on robotics to improve efficiency and customer service could also play a key role in the industry\u2019s development this year, though it is too early to determine the financial implications of these moves. We decided to shortlist a few stocks that we believe could benefit from an improving industry environment in 2025. To come up with the list of 10 restaurant stocks with a high growth rate, we only considered stocks that have grown by more than 15% in the last 5 years or since IPO and have a market cap of at least $1 billion. A close-up image of a colorful salad platter with toppings and dressings. CAVA Group, Inc. (NYSE:CAVA) CAVA Group Inc. runs a restaurant chain that provides Mediterranean-inspired food and salad dressing, dips, and spreads in grocery stores. Moreover, it offers mobile ordering and online platforms. It is a competitor of companies like Dominos, Dutch Bros, Yum China Holdings, and TXRH. All these companies are valued in a narrow range in terms of market cap. However, only Dutch Bros has a higher sales growth, more than double that of CAVA. CAVA is also valued at a premium compared to its competitors, but that can be pinned down to impressive growth and cash flows. For instance, while the entire sector struggled to improve its cash flows, CAVA grew its operating cash flow by 110% YoY. This is the type of company that Wall Street loves, hence the rich valuation which shouldn\u2019t scare investors. The stock is already up 8% YTD while most of its industry peers struggle to appreciate in price. Overall CAVA ranks 10th on our list of the high growth restaurant stocks for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of CAVA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as CAVA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock .

Blackstone\u2019s CEO search process for its 250 companies Ruth Umoh Updated Mon, Feb 3, 2025, 6:58 PM 15 min read In This Article: BX -2.02% The CEO candidate seemed like a perfect fit. Blackstone , the private equity titan, had acquired a real estate company and was searching for the ideal leader to helm it. The candidate had excelled as a senior executive at another Blackstone-owned real estate company and had greatly impressed interviewers on the CEO search committee. But soon after he was hired to the new position, problems began to surface. The role required a chief executive who had a strong grasp of the local market, relationships with regional policymakers, and expertise in managing regulatory affairs\u2014areas where his experience was limited. Within six months, it was clear that the CEO was struggling. The company had fallen significantly behind on its growth plan and failed to meet key financial milestones. Blackstone initially attempted to hire its way out of the problem, adding a chief transformation officer, an executive to restructure costs, and a more active advisory board chair. The CEO was also given feedback and coaching. But despite those efforts, his tenure lasted only two years. \u201cIf we had simply stepped back and asked ourselves, \u2018What do we uniquely need this CEO to do to get us where we need to be?\u2019 we would have realized he wasn\u2019t the right fit,\u201d admits Courtney della Cava, Blackstone\u2019s senior managing director and global head of portfolio talent and organizational performance. \u201cInstead, we became enamored with his past success\u2014and it set us back.\u201d It was a costly error, but one that Della Cava says highlights the importance of Blackstone\u2019s current approach to hiring CEOs for the 250 companies in its portfolio. Blackstone has reached the top of the private equity pyramid by mastering the art of acquiring promising companies , improving their operations and profitability over a few years, then selling them at a higher value. It\u2019s a strategy that has grown its portfolio of companies and real estate assets to a value of $1.1 trillion\u2014a nearly 13- fold increase compared to the $88 billion in assets under management when it went public in 2007. The success of this model hinges on having the right leaders in place. And Della Cava was hired in 2021 to transform the firm\u2019s CEO recruitment from an art to a more precise science. Landing a C-Suite role at a Blackstone portfolio company is exceptionally competitive, and most candidates won\u2019t make the cut, says Dan Kaplan, a senior client partner at Korn Ferry\u2019s CHRO practice. \u201cEveryone wants to be there,\u201d Kaplan says. \u201cIt has become a brand synonymous with being best in class.\" Under Della Cava, each aspiring company leader now undergoes a rigorous and time-consuming three- to four-month recruitment process that includes nearly a dozen interviews with Blackstone stakeholders, advisors, and consulting partners, as well as board presentations, third-party assessments, exhaustive feedback from references, and a nearly five-hour psychometric evaluation that\u2019s designed to deeply probe the candidate\u2019s cognitive ability, character, motivations, and essence as a leader. Story Continues Selecting a CEO is about betting on potential, and Della Cava has found that each component of Blackstone\u2019s search process improves the likelihood of making the right appointment. This playbook, she says, is especially critical for a role that is grueling, fast-paced, and requires a person who can handle the volatility of being celebrated as a hero one day and criticized as a villain the next. \u201cBeing a CEO is a high-intensity sport,\u201d says Della Cava. \u201cFor the right person, it\u2019s extraordinary. But it\u2019s not for everyone.\u201d Blackstone's CEO recruitment framework, which Della Cava and her team have refined over the past four years, has quickly become the envy of other private equity firms , according to several executive recruiters. Her 11-person team often works on dozens of companies\u2019 leadership searches at once. With billions of dollars at stake, the importance of selecting the right CEO for a Blackstone portfolio company is extraordinarily high\u2014for not only a company\u2019s financial success but also its culture. \u201cAn underperforming leader results in an underperforming company,\u201d says Della Cava. Put simply, she says: \u201cLeadership is the No. 1 driver of value creation.\" And getting a hire wrong can be a cascading disaster. Studies conducted by management consulting firm ghSMART found that a typical hiring mistake costs a company 15 times the employee\u2019s base salary in hard costs and lost productivity. For example, a single error in hiring a $100,000 employee could result in losses exceeding $1.5 million. The stakes are even greater for executive roles. Born and raised in San Diego and now living in San Francisco, Della Cava defies the stereotype of the laid-back, sun-chasing Californian. Impeccably dressed, well-groomed, and tall, she exudes a polished self-assuredness and sophistication reminiscent of a corporate Manhattan power player. She\u2019s warm and highly personable, but also mentally shrewd, with a thoughtful and deliberate way of choosing her words. Della Cava says she has always been introspective, and was curious from a young age about what drives people\u2019s actions and decisions\u2014partly the result, she says, of being the youngest of four kids. \u201cI was the kid who put herself to sleep,\u201d she recalls. \u201cWhen you\u2019re the baby in a large family, you become self-sufficient, and I became very observant, which turned out to be a gift.\" Her father, an attorney, and her mother, a homemaker, often hosted dinner parties. \u201cI would sit under the dining room table as a kid and just listen,\u201d she says. \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t know I was there, but it was a wonderful learning experience. I was enthralled by their conversations, trying to connect the dots and understand what they were discussing.\u201d This fascination with people and their motivations initially led Della Cava to a career in marketing. \u201cI wanted to understand why people make the choices they do. Why Pepsi over Coke? Why Mazda over other car companies?\u201d she says, seated in a 43rd-floor boardroom at Blackstone\u2019s headquarters overlooking Manhattan\u2019s Park Avenue. Her career eventually shifted to management consulting, including stints at Bain & Company and Russell Reynolds. At Bain, much of her work centered on \u201cthe what\u201d\u2014as in, the strategy, she explains: \u201cHow do you figure out a business model quickly? What are the market dynamics, and what adds value?\u201d In 2010, Della Cava joined Russell Reynolds as the firm transitioned from being generalist to becoming expert in select industries. It was there that she had a pivotal realization: While much of the management consulting industry focuses on \u201cthe what,\u201d success largely hinges on finding the right \u201cwho\u201d to execute it: the staff, and especially company leaders. This epiphany came from her relationship with a longtime client, a retail CEO, who followed Della Cava from her previous role in management consulting to her new position in executive search. Their dynamic evolved from \u201csterile\u201d strategy discussions to deeply personal coaching about his ambitions, legacy, succession planning, and building a strong executive talent pipeline. \u201cI had this aha moment,\u201d she explains. \u201cIf we could help companies get the right people in, they could figure out the \u2018what\u2019 because good leaders know the right questions to ask. But equally, you can\u2019t get the right people in until you\u2019re clear on strategy.\" From her front-row seat working with Fortune 500 clients, Della Cava found that the most successful companies focus intensely on the \u201cwhat\u201d and the \u201cwho.\u201d Both are encompassed in what Blackstone calls an \u201cinvestment thesis\u201d for each company. $1.1 trillion A Blackstone investment thesis identifies three to five key levers for creating maximum value, which may include M&A, digital investments, or expansion into adjacent markets, and always incorporates a leadership component. It also sets the time horizon for achieving these objectives and, if applicable, outlines the exit plan. The CEO selection process is extensive\u2014and can be exhausting for candidates going through its many phases. It begins during the due-diligence process for a potential new investment. \u201cStep one is figuring out how to drive the most value for the company,\u201d says Della Cava. \u201cStep two is finding leaders who can stay the course and deliver on it.\u201d Della Cava\u2019s group assesses the company\u2019s organizational structure, culture, and incumbent C-Suite. They collaborate with external advisors, business heads across private equity and real estate, and Blackstone\u2019s network of approximately 100 senior advisors to translate the emerging investment thesis into leadership requirements. About 85% of the time, there is some C-Suite reshuffling, which Della Cava acknowledges can be anxiety-inducing for incumbent executives. But she stresses that the process is not a one-sided slashing and burning of the existing leadership team. \u201cIt\u2019s a transparent dialogue where we\u2019re assessing whether the current team has the capabilities and skills required,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd they\u2019re also determining if they want to stay.\u201d For each mission-critical C-Suite and board role, Della Cava\u2019s team creates a leadership scorecard that aligns their responsibilities with value-driving levers. After a deal is finalized, the CEO search begins in earnest. Blackstone works with executive recruitment firms such as Spencer Stuart to identify potential candidates to replace the current leadership. During the early stages of a CEO search, around 10 to 15 candidates are considered, with only two advancing to the final stages. The process typically takes 90 to 120 days, with CEOs selected after an executive chair has been appointed. \"Being a CEO is a high-intensity sport. For the right person, it's extraordinary. But it's not for everyone.\" In some cases, no changes are made to the C-Suite. Other times, a new role is added, or an existing executive is promoted. By the end of the first year of the investment, however, the go-forward team is firmly in place. In November 2022, Ross Shuster, then CEO of Scotland-based industrial company Howden, got such a call from Spencer Stuart. Would he be interested in a CEO opportunity at a Blackstone portfolio company? The previous month, Blackstone had announced its $14 billion acquisition of a majority stake in the engineering firm Emerson\u2019s climate technologies business, forming a new company later named Copeland. It was a complex transaction: Though Blackstone had acquired the business, Emerson retained a 40% equity stake. Copeland, an HVAC compressor company, needed a CEO capable of carving out and transforming a noncore division of a larger conglomerate into a stand-alone entity\u2014all while driving significant growth. What followed for Shuster was an intensive four-month process that included multiple interviews with nearly a dozen people. He flew from the U.K. to New York City twice to meet the Blackstone team and spent countless hours preparing for each interview and the final board presentation\u2014while still managing his CEO responsibilities at the time. \u201cIt was definitely time-consuming,\u201d says Shuster, who officially assumed Copeland\u2019s corner office in April 2023. \u201cBut it was intentional. It was focused.\u201d The most probing interview that Shuster went through before he was hired was with Rosanna Trasatti, a clinical psychologist and leadership consultant who has helped administer many of Blackstone\u2019s psychometric analyses. Trasatti\u2019s job is to get past the spiel that most candidates come prepared to deliver. Those who have reached the highest levels of corporate America tend to present a polished persona. \u201cThey\u2019ve reflected deeply, are self-aware, and have crafted a well-rehearsed narrative they\u2019ve shared countless times,\u201d says Trasatti. Made the cut Ross Shuster, CEO of the climate tech firm Copeland. The nearly five-hour psychometric assessment, with its probing and incisive questions, is designed to push candidates to move beyond their practiced narratives and offer deeper insights into how they think, learn, lead, and communicate. \u201cBy hour three\u2014and certainly by hour four\u2014 most candidates let their guard down,\u201d says Trasatti. \u201cIt\u2019s challenging to maintain a polished story for that long.\u201d Some of the questions prompt candidates to provide specific examples of their tasks and results, while others are designed to encourage deeper reflection on the candidate\u2019s life journey. \u201cWe take people back to their childhood and ask them to explore where they believe their drive originates,\u201d she explains. For instance, prospective CEOs might be asked to select six colleagues from the past five years and explain how those coworkers would describe them. This encourages candidates to imagine themselves through the eyes of peers, reports, and bosses. \u201cWe\u2019re cognitively playing with getting them to access and share their stories in different ways,\u201d says Trasatti. \u201cI don\u2019t allow them to sit in a space of practiced responses or emotional detachment from their narrative.\u201d The psychometric results are shared with participants during the session, where they\u2019re able to discuss and pressure-test them. Sometimes candidates get defensive because they don\u2019t agree with the results. Sometimes the insights challenge their understanding of their own leadership style. If a candidate\u2019s analysis suggests they thrive in entrepreneurial environments with minimal structure, for example, Trasatti might ask how they would handle implementing extensive structured processes. Doing so allows candidates to engage with the data, reflect on whether it resonates, and navigate unexpected or even difficult conversations that deviate from their prepared narrative. For Shuster, the assessment highlighted his leadership style as that of a team builder. While capable of taking charge when necessary, he prefers to act as a facilitator, empowering others and fostering a shared ownership of decision-making. \u201cMy ideal executive team is, if someone walked into a room and saw the 12 of us talking, it would be hard to identify who the CEO, CFO, or CHRO is because everyone is passionate about every aspect of the business,\u201d says Shuster. The psychometric analysis also assesses the traits that are predictive of high performance, grouping them into \u201csuccess modes\u201d and \u201cfailure modes.\u201d Success mode traits include resilience, grit, humility, and a track record of cultivating loyalty and followership, while failure modes often involve insecurity and low cognitive ability. \u201cCognitive ability\u201d might seem too obvious a requirement to note. But there\u2019s more to the quality than simple intelligence. Candidates complete a timed test to measure their mental processing speed and gauge whether they can operate at the fast pace required for the corner office. \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018Are you smart or stupid?\u2019\u201d says Della Cava. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Can you keep up? Do you have the cognitive speed, the ambition, the intellectual rigor, and mental agility to meet the demands of the role?\u2019\u201d While candidates who score well below a certain threshold are more likely to fail as CEOs, a higher-than-average cognitive score does not necessarily predict success. \u201cYou kind of have to be tall enough to ride the ride, but being taller doesn\u2019t make you enjoy the Ferris wheel more,\u201d Trasatti explains. References offer yet another assessment opportunity. Della Cava\u2019s team goes beyond the references provided by CEO candidates, back-channeling and reaching out to its own network for deeper insights into the candidate\u2019s work history. The group could include board directors, CEOs, customers, clients, former sponsors, or direct reports. By the time candidates reach the board presentation stage, Blackstone has narrowed the CEO pool to two or three finalists. These hour-long presentations provide candidates with an opportunity to share their thoughts on the investment thesis and outline their plans for execution. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a dress rehearsal for how they\u2019ll engage with us,\u201d says Della Cava. It's an incredibly comprehensive approach, but as with anything involving human judgment, it\u2019s not 100% error-free. Missteps have occurred when the firm overlooked obvious warning signs or overestimated its ability to mitigate them, says Della Cava. Even with all the information and data gleaned from the extensive selection process, she concedes that it\u2019s easy to become enamored with a candidate. \u201cYou start to build a character in your head instead of asking, \u2018What do I uniquely need them to do? What specific qualities should I prioritize? What are the pragmatic tradeoffs, and how can we address their shortcomings with the right support and scaffolding?'\" The recipe for success as a Blackstone portfolio CEO Blackstone\u2019s rigorous process for selecting C-Suite executives to run its portfolio companies includes a nearly five-hour psychometric evaluation to assess whether candidates possess the qualities required to excel in these high-pressure roles. Based on hundreds of assessments of C Suite candidates, the firm has identified key traits that indicate a candidate\u2019s potential for success\u2014or risk of failure. Here are a few of them. Success modes Resilience: Leaders are able to thrive under pressure, steadily managing a rapid pace, complex changes, ambitious goals, and constant scrutiny without buckling. Confident leadership: Leaders can rally their staff during periods of change because they have a compelling presence and can quickly capture attention, establish credibility, and earn trust. High emotional intelligence: Leaders have emotional awareness and empathy and can self-regulate their feelings. They build strong relationships, navigate complex interpersonal dynamics with ease, and are exceptional communicators. Self-awareness: Leaders demonstrate humility, take accountability for their mistakes, understand the impact of their behavior on the company, and understand their strengths and weakness. Failure modes Below-average cognitive heft: Candidates whose problem-solving ability and mental processing speed are below average relative to their executive peers are unlikely to succeed. Inflexibility: An unwillingness to adapt, change, or compromise in response to new circumstances or ideas works against candidates. Insecurity: Candidates who often seek reassurance and answers from others, or who try to keep up an appearance of success by withholding information, avoiding issues, or presenting an overly optimistic outlook increase their risk of failure.
