Market Forecast 2024-2030: Key Trends, Industry Insights, and Growth Opportunities - A $3.7 Billion Growth Opportunity Research and Markets Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 12:06 PM 8 min read Company Logo Dublin, Jan. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Private 5G Networks in the United States: 2024 - 2030\" report from SNS Telecom & IT has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. Private LTE networks in the United States date back to the 2010s as a niche segment of the cellular industry, characterized by specialized projects such as FirstNet early builder networks, tactical LTE networks for the military, iNET's (Infrastructure Networks) 700 MHz LTE network in the Permian Basin, and Tampnet's offshore LTE service rollout in the Gulf of Mexico. With the availability of new spectrum options and 5G technology, the market is gaining mainstream adoption with deployments of all shapes and sizes, from low-band macrocell networks for utility operations across multi-state service territories and city-wide networks in Las Vegas, Santa Maria, Tucson, Glendale, Brownsville, Longmont, New York City, and other municipalities to medium-scale networks for school districts, university campuses, and military bases; highly localized wireless systems at factories, warehouses, oil and gas facilities, maritime ports, airports, hotels, hospitals, and sports stadiums; and temporary networks in support of live broadcasting and special events. Although the market is dominated by LTE technology, commercial deployments of private 5G networks are starting to gain significant traction in industrial and enterprise settings. Notable examples of facilities where private 5G networks are operational or being deployed include Walmart's distribution centers, Tesla's Gigafactory Texas, BMW Group's Spartanburg plant, GM's (General Motors) Factory ZERO assembly center, Toyota Material Handling's Columbus production complex, Cummins' JEP (Jamestown Engine Plant), LG Electronics' Clarksville home appliance manufacturing plant, Delta Air Lines' Atlanta operating hub, DFW (Dallas Fort Worth) International Airport, the Port of Virginia's container terminals, Boston Children's Hospital, Cleveland Clinic's Mentor Hospital, the VA's (Department of Veterans Affairs) healthcare systems, and several of the DOD's (Department of Defense) military installations. Other end user organizations, including John Deere, have also begun implementing standalone 5G connectivity at select facilities, alongside their continued rollout of private LTE networks. Another emerging trend is the growing recognition of private network-based neutral host solutions for public cellular coverage enhancement in indoor locations where DAS (Distributed Antenna System) installations are deemed too costly and complex to implement. Facilitated by the open accessibility of 3.5 GHz CBRS spectrum, private networks supporting neutral host operations are increasingly being deployed in industrial facilities, carpeted enterprise spaces, public venues, hospitals, hotels, higher education campuses, and schools across the United States. Story Continues Some examples of such deployments include Tesla, Toyota, and Cummins' production sites, Meta's corporate offices, City of Hope Hospital, SHC (Stanford Health Care), Sound Hotel, Gale South Beach Hotel, Gale Hotel & Residences (formerly Natiivo Miami), Nobu Hotel, ASU (Arizona State University), Cal Poly (California Polytechnic State University), University of Virginia, Duke University, and Parkside Elementary School. The research estimates that annual spending on private LTE and 5G network infrastructure in the United States will grow at a CAGR of approximately 18% between 2024 and 2027, cumulatively accounting for more than $3.7 Billion by the end of 2027. The market's growth will be underpinned by a diversity of spectrum options, including shared Band 48/n48 (3.5 GHz) CBRS spectrum, Globalstar's Band 53/n53 (2.4 GHz) spectrum, Band 41/n41 (2.5 GHz) EBS licenses, Band 8/n106 (900 MHz) broadband spectrum for critical infrastructure, dedicated DOD and public safety broadband spectrum, and service provider licensed frequencies.

Request for a sample of this research report @ https://www.gminsights.com/request-sample/detail/12342 The increasing demand for remote patient monitoring and virtual consultations, particularly after the global health crisis, has accelerated the adoption of telemedicine. Both healthcare providers and patients are increasingly aware of the convenience and efficiency that telemedicine offers. Moreover, advancements in technologies such as high-speed internet, mobile apps, and wearable devices have made remote healthcare more accessible and dependable. These innovations have enabled real-time consultations and continuous monitoring, bridging the gap between patients and healthcare professionals, thus boosting the market for acute care telemedicine. The rising rates of chronic diseases and an aging population are further driving the demand for acute care telemedicine services. Many individuals now seek medical attention remotely, reducing the need for frequent hospital visits and improving the management of long-term health conditions. Additionally, supportive government policies and initiatives continue to fuel the growth of the telemedicine industry, creating a favorable environment for its expansion. The acute care telemedicine market is segmented based on delivery methods into clinician-to-patient and clinician-to-clinician categories. The clinician-to-patient segment holds the largest market share and is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. This segment is crucial because it enables real-time consultations and diagnoses, allowing healthcare professionals to provide immediate care to patients in urgent situations, regardless of their location. In terms of application, the acute care telemedicine market includes segments such as teleradiology, telepsychiatry, tele-ICU, and others. The teleradiology segment, which accounts for a significant share, is growing rapidly due to the increasing demand for fast and accurate diagnostic services in critical care.

Traps?

Every week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio , shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks. Not all stocks finished the year in outstanding fashion. Some stocks sold off after the election in November 2024 and have not yet recovered. Some are down as much as 20%, or more, in just the last 3 months. But you know what that means. It could be a buying opportunity. But are these stocks values or traps? How to Tell the Difference Between a Value or a Trap Lots of stocks can look cheap, especially after a sell-off. They may even have a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. But that doesn\u2019t mean the stock is a \u201cvalue.\u201d Investors should look at the earnings outlook. Are earnings rising? Is there earnings growth year over year? That will tell you whether it\u2019s a true value or a trap. 5 Stocks on Sale: Values or Traps? 1. PulteGroup, Inc. ( PHM ) PulteGroup is one of the largest publicly traded homebuilders in the United States. As mortgage rates have risen back over 7%, shares of PulteGroup have fallen.

( LLY ) Eli Lilly was red hot the last 2 years due to its popular weight loss drugs. But, over the last 3 months, shares of Eli Lilly have fallen 18.3%.

Trump's tariffs Top Analyst Reports for Eli Lilly, Exxon Mobil & Costco Mark Vickery Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 12:29 AM 7 min read In This Article: COST LLY XOM Wednesday, January 22, 2025 The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST), as well a micro-cap stock Flanigan's Enterprises, Inc. (BDL). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today. You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>> Eli Lilly\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+18.2% vs. -1.7%). Demand for the company\u2019s popular GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, remains strong, making them the company\u2019s key top-line drivers. Its new drugs contributed significantly to top-line growth in 2024. Lilly is also making rapid pipeline progress in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s. However, sales of Mounjaro/Zepbound were disappointing in the second half of 2024 due to slower-than-expected growth, which has raised concerns about moderating demand for the drugs. Declining sales of Trulicity, rising pricing pressure on some drugs and potential competition in the GLP-1 diabetes/obesity market are some top-line headwinds. Estimates have declined ahead of fourth-quarter results. Lilly has a mixed record of earnings surprises in recent quarters. (You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here >>> ) Shares of Exxon Mobil have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+19.6% vs. +14.5%). The company\u2019s high-value assets in the Permian Basin and Guyana drive robust production growth, doubling upstream earnings since 2019. The Pioneer acquisition and Guyana ramp-up have enhanced profitability, while a robust structural savings strengthen resilience. With a lower exposure to debt capital, XOM supports steady cash flows, dividends, buybacks and investments in high-return projects. Expansion in low-carbon tech, including Baytown's hydrogen facility, positions it for future growth. Yet, refining margins are pressured due to global capacity increases, with refining profits softening. The refining margin pressure intensifies the reliance on upstream operations which is vulnerable to fluctuating oil and gas prices. Commodity price volatility challenges profitability, especially as crude prices dipped in the third quarter. (You can read the full research report on Exxon Mobil here >>> ) Costco\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry over the past year (+43.3% vs. +23.6%). The company being a consumer defensive stock, Costco has been surviving the market turmoil pretty well. The discount retailer\u2019s key strengths are strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives, and an emphasis on membership growth. These factors have been helping it register decent sales and earnings numbers. The Zacks analyst expects Costco to register an 11.5% adjusted earnings per share improvement in fiscal 2025 on 6.6% revenue growth. This outlook reflects Costco\u2019s ability to navigate the challenging operating environment, generate solid sales, and register high membership renewal rates. A favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing power, and strong liquidity position should help Costco keep outperforming. While trading at a premium to its peers, its long-term growth prospects should help the stock see a solid upside. (You can read the full research report on Costco here >>> ) Shares of Flanigan's have underperformed the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry over the past year (-3.1% vs. +6.3%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $46.45 million is facing risks which include a 16.1% net income decline, inflation-driven margin pressure, flat franchise revenue and geographic concentration. Regulatory challenges, high competition and limited diversification further weigh on prospects. Nonetheless, the package store segment and steady rental income provide stability. Flanigan's achieved 7.9% revenue growth to $188.3 million in fiscal 2024 from $174.4 million in the prior year, driven by a 6.3% rise in restaurant sales and 15.1% growth in package store sales, showcasing a diversified revenue model. Geographic expansion opportunities, resilient operations amid cost pressures, and rising dine-in demand position the company for long-term growth. Operational efficiencies help combat rising costs, while digital transformation and menu innovation could enhance customer experience and loyalty.

Aerospace Unit Aids Parker-Hannifin (PH) Amid Weak Liquidity Per the Zacks analyst, Parker-Hannifin will benefit from strength in Aerospace Systems segment, led by robust OEM and aftermarket demand. However, weak liquidity position remains concerning. CNG Vehicles Aid Republic Services (RSG) Amid Low Liquidity Per the Zacks analyst, Republic Services is focused on increasing its operational efficiency by shifting to compressed natural gas (CNG) collection vehicles. Low liquidity remains a concern. Solid Budget Aids Curtiss-Wright (CW) Amid Fuel Price Hike Per the Zacks analyst, increasing U.S. defense budget should boost demand for Curtiss-Wright's nuclear propulsion equipment. Yet rising fuel price might hurt airline industry and in turn the stock RH Benefits From Innovation Amid Macroeconomic Challenges The Zacks analyst believes that product innovation, global expansion, experiential retail, and technology will benefit RH. Yet, slow real estate market dampens sales. Solid Transportation Segment Aids Trimble's (TRMB) Prospects Per the Zacks analyst, Trimble is benefiting from strong momentum in the transportation segment, driven by organic growth in enterprise and strong demand for map solutions. Credit Sales, Receivables Growth Drive Bread Financial (BFH) Per the Zacks analyst, Bread Financial is set to grow on credit sales growth driven by existing partners, as well as new product and brand partner additions. Yet, high expenses weighing on margin ail. New Upgrades Buyouts, Rates, Solid IB Business & Loans Aid JPMorgan (JPM) Per the Zacks analyst, higher rates for longer, decent loan growth, acquisitions, a robust resurgence in the IB business and branch openings will support JPMorgan's financials. Strong IB Business, Solid Liquidity Profile Aid Goldman (GS) Per the Zacks analyst, a rebound in global M&A activity will support Goldman's investment banking (IB) business growth. A solid liquidity position is an added advantage. Telephone and Data Systems (TDS) Rides on Strong Fiber Growth Per the Zacks analyst, solid growth in residential broadband connections will likely boost Telephone and Data Systems' top line. Strong emphasis on fiber network expansion is a tailwind. New Downgrades Weak Demand, Low Steel Margins Ail Commercial Metals (CMC) Per the Zacks Analyst, Commercial Metals is bearing the brunt of lower steel product margins over scrap costs. Sluggish demand in Europe is also putting pressure on pricing and margins. Rising Expenses & Net Outflows Hurt Artisan Partners (APAM) Per the Zacks analyst, rising expenses from higher revenue-based incentive compensation are likely to hurt Artisan Partner's bottom line, while rising net outflows are likely to hurt its AUM growth. Changing Marketplace Conditions Ail AMN Healthcare (AMN) The Zacks analyst is worried about AMN Healthcare's ability to adapt to changing marketplace conditions in evolving care delivery settings. A tough competitive space is an added concern. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Trump's tariffs Bullish AMN Healthcare Services Insiders Loaded Up On US$1.99m Of Stock editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 3:14 PM 3 min read In This Article: AMN Over the last year, a good number of insiders have significantly increased their holdings in AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. ( NYSE:AMN ). This is encouraging because it indicates that insiders are more optimistic about the company's prospects. While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for AMN Healthcare Services The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At AMN Healthcare Services The President Caroline Grace made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$992k worth of shares at a price of US$57.06 each. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$26.12. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares.

Trump's tariffs Abercrombie & Fitch and AMN Healthcare Services in the Box have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day Zacks Equity Research Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 4:14 PM 12 min read In This Article: ANF AMN TSM ^GSPC For Immediate Release Chicago, IL \u2013 January 17, 2025 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ANF, as the Bull of the Day and AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. AMN, as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Taiwan Semiconductor TSM, Nvidia NVDA and Apple AAPL. Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: Bull of the Day: Abercrombie & Fitch Co. had a strong holiday season. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) recently raised its fourth quarter and full year net sales outlook. Abercrombie & Fitch is an omnichannel specialty retailer of apparel and accessories whose customers are kids through millennials. It has a family of brands, including Abercrombie & Fitch and Hollister. It operates about 770 stores under these brands across North America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. It also operates three e-commerce sites for Abercrombie, Abercrombie Kids and Hollister. Abercrombie & Fitch Raised Q4 and the Full Year Net Sales Outlook On Jan 13, 2025, Abercrombie & Fitch provided a business update and increased its net sales outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2024. For the fourth quarter, net sales are now expected to grow in the range of 7% to 8%, up from the prior guidance range of 5% to 7%. Abercrombie also increased its full year net sales growth outlook to around 15%, which is at the high end of its previous guidance range of 14% to 15%. \u201cThrough fiscal December, we delivered record quarter-to-date net sales, exceeding the expectations we provided in November,\u201d said Fran Horowitz, Chief Executive Officer. \u201cTotal net sales growth was supported by comparable sales across regions and brands through the holiday selling period,\u201d he added. Analysts Raise Fiscal 2024 and 2025 Earnings Estimates Given how bullish Abercrombie is, it\u2019s not a surprise that the analysts are also bullish. 3 estimates were raised for the full year 2024 since the business update was provided. 1 was also lowered, however. The Zacks Consensus Estimate rose by a penny to $10.64 during that time. That\u2019s earnings growth of 69.4% as Abercrombie made just $6.28 in fiscal 2023. 2 estimates were also raised for fiscal 2025 in the last week as well. But 2 were also lowered. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 rose to $11.25 from $11.22 in the past 7 days. That\u2019s another 5.7% in earnings growth. Abercrombie Stock Sells Off on the News: Is It Cheap? But the business update was apparently not good enough for traders. The stock sold off on the news and is now down 19.4% over the last 6 months, versus the S&P 500 which is up 6.2% during that same time. Story Continues The stock has had a volatile 6 months after reaching new highs in early 2024. But Abecrombie is cheap on a fundamental basis. With the stock sell-off, but the rise in the earnings estimates, Abercrombie now trades with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 12.2. A P/E ratio under 15 is usually considered a value. For investors looking for a specialty retailer which is on trend and has sales momentum, then Abercrombie & Fitch should be on your short list. Bear of the Day: AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. is still trying to find a bottom in healthcare staffing. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is expected to see falling earnings again in 2025. AMN Healthcare helps healthcare providers optimize their workforce. AMN total talent solutions include direct staffing, vendor-neutral and managed services programs, clinical and interim healthcare leaders, temporary staffing, permanent placement, executive search, vendor management systems, recruitment process outsourcing, predictive modeling, language services, revenue cycle solutions, and other services. An Aging Population and an Aging Healthcare Workforce Collide In Jan 2025, AMN Healthcare held an Investor Day where it talked about the outlook for the healthcare workforce and an aging population. According to AMN Healthcare, by 2035, the estimate is that there will be 76 million people age 65 or older. That is up from 58 million in 2022. But the healthcare workforce is also aging at the same time. Currently, about 50% of RNs and physicians are 50+. By 2030, 33% of physicians will be 65+. Globally, by 2030, there is expected to be a 4.5 million shortage of nurses. Additionally, the workforce is on the move. AMN Healthcare said that in the first half of 2024, there was a 28% voluntary turnover among the workforce which was higher than all of pre-pandemic history. This will create opportunities for AMN Healthcare over the next 10 years, along with challenges. But first it must get back to \u201cnormalized\u201d level of demand post-pandemic. AMN Healthcare Beats Again in the Third Quarter On Nov 7, 2024, AMN Healthcare reported its third quarter 2024 results and it beat on earnings again. AMN Healthcare reported $0.61 versus the consensus of $0.58. It has a perfect 5-year earnings surprise track record. That is hard to do in normal circumstances, but that 5-year period still includes the start of the COVID pandemic in 2020. However, the industry was still facing competitive conditions in the third quarter even though earnings were better than expected. It\u2019s total talent solutions continues to be well-received by clients and the average number of services used by top clients increased to approximately 10 in the quarter. Revenue, however, fell 19% to $688 million year-over-year as the company continues to look for a bottom. AMN Healthcare\u2019s largest segment, Nurse and Allied Solutions, fell by 30% to $399 million. Travel nurse staffing revenue dropped by 37% year-over-year and was also down 12% sequentially, reflecting a dip in demand earlier in the year. There were some bright spots. The Physician and Leadership Solutions segment saw revenue rise 13% year-over-year to $181 million. Language Services revenue was also higher, by 13% year-over-year to $75 million. Analysts Slash AMN Healthcare\u2019s Earnings Estimates Again It seemed like 2024 would be the year there would finally be stabilization in AMN Healthcare\u2019s earnings and that they would find a bottom. But the analysts are again cutting earnings estimates. Earnings are expected to fall 62.6% in 2024 to $3.07 from $8.21 in 2023. But 1 estimate has now been lowered in the last 30 days for 2025, pushing the 2025 Zacks Consensus Estimate down to $1.41 from $1.47. But it had been at $3.26 just 90 days ago. That is another earnings decline of 54.2%. AMN Healthcare\u2019s Stock Sinks to New 5-Year Lows With the earnings still tumbling, so is the stock. Shares are at new 5-year lows. But it\u2019s also not cheap. AMN Healthcare still trades with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18.1. A P/E ratio of 15 or under usually indicates there is value. AMN Healthcare does not pay a dividend. While it had a strong cash flow from operations in the third quarter of $67 million, it chose to reduce debt by $60 million. Year-to-date through the third quarter, it had repaid $175 million in debt. Given that the analysts are still cutting earnings estimates for 2025, investors interested in this healthcare staffing company might want to wait on the sidelines for stabilization in earnings. Additional content: Taiwan Semiconductor: The Backbone of AI Surges on Earnings Beat Taiwan Semiconductor , the world\u2019s largest and most advanced chipmaker, has once again showcased its critical role in powering the AI revolution. Reporting a stellar fourth quarter with a 38.8% year-over-year revenue increase and a 57% surge in net income, TSM\u2019s results highlight the insatiable demand for its cutting-edge 3nm and 5nm chips. These chips are the backbone of AI giants like Nvidia , whose GPUs dominate the market, and Apple , which relies on TSMC to produce its A-series and M-series chips for iPhones and Macs. As advanced technologies (3, 5 and 7 nanometer chips) accounted for a remarkable 74% of TSMC\u2019s wafer revenue, the company\u2019s leadership in innovation continues to solidify its position at the heart of AI and high-performance computing. With robust demand for AI-related applications offsetting seasonal smartphone declines, TSMC's pivotal role in shaping the future of technology has never been clearer. Although Taiwan Semiconductor currently holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) , the company has delivered exceptional performance over the past year, reflecting strong investor interest in owning such a pivotal player in the tech industry. The low Zacks Rank primarily stems from minor downward revisions to earnings estimates, but this latest impressive earnings report could prompt analysts to revisit and potentially upgrade their forecasts. Taiwan Semiconductor AI, Geopolitics and New Chips Taiwan Semiconductor continues to solidify its role as the backbone of the AI revolution, leveraging its advanced 3nm and 5nm technologies to power innovations for major clients like Nvidia, Apple, and many others. In Q4, High-Performance Computing (HPC), which includes AI and 5G applications, accounted for 53% of TSM\u2019s revenue, a significant leap from 43% a year ago\u2014driven by surging AI-related demand. TSM\u2019s CEO, C.C. Wei, affirmed the company\u2019s confidence in navigating geopolitical challenges, including the US export controls on AI chips, emphasizing open communication with both current and future administrations. Despite these geopolitical hurdles, TSM is doubling down on its advanced manufacturing processes, which contributed 74% of total wafer revenue in Q4. With plans to ramp up production of its 3nm and upcoming 2nm nodes, the company is well-positioned to maintain its technological edge. These advancements are crucial not only for sustaining margin expansion but also for supporting high-demand applications like AI inference and training, critical for Nvidia\u2019s GPUs and Apple\u2019s custom silicon. TSM is also taking steps to mitigate risks associated with geopolitical tensions, including expanding its overseas fabs in Arizona and Japan. This diversification strengthens its long-term growth prospects by reducing exposure to regional risks while addressing growing global demand. As the company projects up to $42 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, it reinforces its commitment to advancing AI technologies and maintaining its leadership in the semiconductor industry. Taiwan Semiconductor Shares Trade at a Discount to Growth Taiwan Semiconductor holds a critical position in the global technology supply chain. As the world's largest foundry, it is unparalleled in its ability to meet the modern world's semiconductor demands at scale. This unique and vital role underscores the company's significance in enabling technological advancements across industries. Given its indispensable position, TSM appears to trade at an attractive valuation of 23.5x forward earnings, even when accounting for geopolitical risks. Additionally, with earnings per share expected to grow at an impressive annual rate of 31.2% over the next three to five years, the company boasts a PEG ratio of 0.75, signaling a discount relative to its growth potential. Although TSM is currently trading above its five-year median valuation of 21.5x, the rapid expansion of the AI sector and the company's integral role in its development justify a premium. Should Investors Buy Shares in TSM? Taiwan Semiconductor continues to solidify its position as a cornerstone of the semiconductor, AI, and broader technology industries. As the manufacturing partner for some of the most innovative and influential companies in the world, including Apple, Nvidia, and many others, TSM is uniquely positioned at the forefront of technological advancement. However, potential investors should note that TSM currently holds a low Zacks Rank, reflecting recent downward revisions in earnings estimates. This could signal near-term headwinds or a cautious outlook from analysts despite the company\u2019s strong fundamentals and growth prospects. For investors who like to stay on the right side of the Zacks Rank, it might be prudent to wait for signs of improving earnings revisions before initiating a position. That said, TSM\u2019s long-term growth trajectory appears intact, driven by its pivotal role in the AI boom and increasing global demand for advanced semiconductors. Investors with a longer time horizon and confidence in the company\u2019s ability to overcome short-term challenges may see the current valuation as an opportunity to buy into one of the most critical players in modern technology. Patience and timing are key, and monitoring earnings revisions and broader market conditions will be essential for making an informed decision. Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Trump's tariffs AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (AMN): A Bull Case Theory Ricardo Pillai Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 8:39 PM 3 min read In This Article: AMN We came across a bullish thesis on AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (AMN) on Directionally Correct Research\u2019s Substack by Will Powers. In this article, we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on AMN. AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (AMN)'s share was trading at $26.12 as of Jan 14 th . AMN\u2019s trailing and forward P/E were 18.27 and 14.51 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. 5 Highest Paying Countries for Nurses antoniodiaz/Shutterstock.com AMN Healthcare, a leading provider of healthcare staffing solutions, saw a significant surge in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic but is now grappling with the normalization of demand and margins post-pandemic. Despite facing challenges, signs suggest the company is nearing a bottom, with stabilization in bill rates and a gradual recovery in demand. The company\u2019s most substantial segment, Nurse and Allied Staffing (N&A), which comprises roughly 65% of sales and 50% of EBITDA, is seeing a return to more stable conditions. Bill rates, which had soared during the pandemic, have stabilized, with slight increases reported in recent quarters. Although bill rates remain lower than the pandemic highs, a modest uptick is expected, driven by a convergence of supply and demand in the staffing market. AMN's N&A segment is directly influenced by bill rates, order volume, and fill rates. The company has already seen a decline in open nursing roles compared to the pandemic peak, but a strong increase in staffing requests has been noted in recent months, indicating that demand for temporary healthcare workers is picking up, albeit still well below 2019 levels. Additionally, fill rates, which had been impacted by declining clinician compensation expectations, are showing signs of improvement. As bill rates and clinician compensation expectations align, fill rates should increase, driving revenue growth in the N&A segment. Beyond N&A, AMN\u2019s other segments, including Physician & Leadership Solutions and Technology & Workforce Solutions, are also poised for growth. The P&L business, which provides temporary staffing for physicians, is expected to show more resilience than N&A due to physicians' closer link to revenue generation for providers. T&WS, which includes language services and a Vendor Management System for staffing logistics, is projected to continue growing at a double-digit rate, contributing stable and high-margin revenue. This diversification into more stable, technology-enabled services should help bolster AMN\u2019s overall financial stability. Looking ahead, AMN\u2019s EBITDA is expected to recover to $340M by 2027, with free cash flow per share reaching $4.70. Assuming a return to historical valuation multiples, AMN\u2019s stock could appreciate to over $50, offering a high-20% IRR over the next three years. The company\u2019s investment in technology and its diversification into higher-margin, more stable businesses position it well for a gradual recovery, even as the staffing market normalizes.

Trump's tariffs Bear of the Day: AMN Healthcare Services (AMN) Tracey Ryniec Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 2:09 PM 4 min read In This Article: AMN AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. AMN is still trying to find a bottom in healthcare staffing. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is expected to see falling earnings again in 2025. AMN Healthcare helps healthcare providers optimize their workforce. AMN total talent solutions include direct staffing, vendor-neutral and managed services programs, clinical and interim healthcare leaders, temporary staffing, permanent placement, executive search, vendor management systems, recruitment process outsourcing, predictive modeling, language services, revenue cycle solutions, and other services. An Aging Population and an Aging Healthcare Workforce Collide In Jan 2025, AMN Healthcare held an Investor Day where it talked about the outlook for the healthcare workforce and an aging population. According to AMN Healthcare, by 2035, the estimate is that there will be 76 million people age 65 or older. That is up from 58 million in 2022. But the healthcare workforce is also aging at the same time. Currently, about 50% of RNs and physicians are 50+. By 2030, 33% of physicians will be 65+. Globally, by 2030, there is expected to be a 4.5 million shortage of nurses. Additionally, the workforce is on the move. AMN Healthcare said that in the first half of 2024, there was a 28% voluntary turnover among the workforce which was higher than all of pre-pandemic history. This will create opportunities for AMN Healthcare over the next 10 years, along with challenges. But first it must get back to \u201cnormalized\u201d level of demand post-pandemic. AMN Healthcare Beats Again in the Third Quarter On Nov 7, 2024, AMN Healthcare reported its third quarter 2024 results and it beat on earnings again. AMN Healthcare reported $0.61 versus the consensus of $0.58. It has a perfect 5-year earnings surprise track record. That is hard to do in normal circumstances, but that 5-year period still includes the start of the COVID pandemic in 2020. However, the industry was still facing competitive conditions in the third quarter even though earnings were better than expected. It\u2019s total talent solutions continues to be well-received by clients and the average number of services used by top clients increased to approximately 10 in the quarter. Revenue, however, fell 19% to $688 million year-over-year as the company continues to look for a bottom. AMN Healthcare\u2019s largest segment, Nurse and Allied Solutions, fell by 30% to $399 million. \u00a0Travel nurse staffing revenue dropped by 37% year-over-year and was also down 12% sequentially, reflecting a dip in demand earlier in the year. Story Continues There were some bright spots. The Physician and Leadership Solutions segment saw revenue rise 13% year-over-year to $181 million. Language Services revenue was also higher, by 13% year-over-year to $75 million. Analysts Slash AMN Healthcare\u2019s Earnings Estimates Again It seemed like 2024 would be the year there would finally be stabilization in AMN Healthcare\u2019s earnings and that they would find a bottom. But the analysts are again cutting earnings estimates. Earnings are expected to fall 62.6% in 2024 to $3.07 from $8.21 in 2023. But 1 estimate has now been lowered in the last 30 days for 2025, pushing the 2025 Zacks Consensus Estimate down to $1.41 from $1.47. But it had been at $3.26 just 90 days ago. That is another earnings decline of 54.2%. Here\u2019s what it looks like on the 5-year price and consensus chart. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research AMN Healthcare\u2019s Stock Sinks to New 5-Year Lows With the earnings still tumbling, so is the stock. Shares are at new 5-year lows. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research But it\u2019s also not cheap. AMN Healthcare still trades with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18.1. A P/E ratio of 15 or under usually indicates there is value. AMN Healthcare does not pay a dividend. While it had a strong cash flow from operations in the third quarter of $67 million, it chose to reduce debt by $60 million. Year-to-date through the third quarter, it had repaid $175 million in debt. Given that the analysts are still cutting earnings estimates for 2025, investors interested in this healthcare staffing company might want to wait on the sidelines for stabilization in earnings.
