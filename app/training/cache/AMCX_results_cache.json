I Doubt It John Dorfman Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 7:22 PM 4 min read In This Article: SLB -0.30% January 13, 2025 (Maple Hill Syndicate) Can professional analysts pick stocks? Don't laugh. Analysts perform many valuable functions. They ask probing questions to management, estimate earnings, and provide a wealth of information on companies and industries. However, a study I've been conducting for a quarter of a century suggests they are no better at picking stocks than your Aunt Louise. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with SLB. Each January, I make note of the four stocks analysts most adore, and the four they most despise. When the year is over, I compare how those two groups of stocks have done. The results are not favorable to Wall Street. On average, over 26 years, the analysts' darlings have returned 7.25%. The stocks they hate have averaged 6.89%. Neither group beats the Standard & Poor's 500 Total ReturnIndex, which rolled in at 12.57% per year. My study covers every year from 1998 through 2024, except for 2008 when I was temporarily retired as a columnist. Figures are total returns, including dividends and capital gains or losses. Latest Scores A year ago, the most popular stock among analysts was Schlumberger Ltd. ( NYSE:SLB ), which garnered 20 buy ratings with nary a hold or sell in sight. What did Schlumberger do for the year? It fell 24.4%. Privia Health Group Inc. ( NASDAQ:PRVA ), which was fourth on analysts' most-loved list, also fell. It lost 15.1% of its value. Better was S&P Global Inc. ( NYSE:SPGI ), which returned 13.9%. And the analysts had one big winner: Targa Resources Corp. ( NYSE:TRGP ) more than doubled, returning 110.1%. That pulled the analysts' average up to 21.1% for2024. What about the stocks that analysts despised? They all had modest gains. Avista Corp. ( NYSE:AVA ) was up 7.8%, Southern Copper Corp. ( NYSE:SCCO ) up 8.3%, and Chenierre Energy Partners ( NYSE:CQP ) up 14.3%. The best performer for the hated brigade was Moelis & Co. ( NYSE:MC ), which returned 37.3%. Collectively, the stocks that Wall Street wouldn't touchachieved a 16.9% return, a little more than four percentage points below the analysts' favorites. Running Tally In 26 outings, the analysts' most-adored stocks have beaten their most-despised names 14 times. The despised brigade have won 11 times, and there was one tie. Against the S&P 500, neither group distinguished itself. The analysts' favorite have beaten the index only seven times out of 26, while the despised issues have beaten it 10 times. Data for the study come from Zacks Investment Research, Bloomberg and Ned Davis Research. Story Continues Most Adored The two stocks analysts most favor as 2025 begins are both airline stocks. United Airlines Holdings Inc. ( NASDAQ:UAL ) get 22 buy ratings, with no sells or holds. The analytical corps is almost equally bullish on Delta AirLines Inc. ( NYSE:DAL ) with 21 unanimous recommendations. It's easy to see why the analysts have warmed up to airlines. Traffic has picked up for both business and leisure travel, and jet fuel is not too expensive these days. But let's remember that Warren Buffett ( Trades , Portfolio ) once said it would have been good for investors if someone had shot Orville and Wilbur Wright. Third on the adored list is Arcelix Inc. ( NASDAQ:ACLX ) with 19 recommendations and no dissents. Arcelix, based in Redwood, California, is a biotech company that says it is reimagining cell therapy through thedevelopment of immunotherapies for patients with cancer and other incurable diseases. A worthy goal, to be sure. But Arcelix had revenue of just under $156 million in the past four quarters, while the market values the stock at $3.47 billion. Several company insiders have sold some of their stock in thepast few months. Rounding out the adored group is Axsome Therapeutics ( NASDAQ:AXSM ) unanimously endorsed by 18 analysts. The company, based in New York City, is developing therapies for diseases of the central nervous system. Most Hated On the list of stocks that analysts can't stand, ZIM Integrated Shipping Services Ltd. (ZIM) ranks first, with five out of seven analysts suggesting that people dump the stock. The stock sells for about $19, down from about $77 four years ago. ZIM has lost money in six of the past ten years. Ginko Bioworks Holdings Inc. ( NYSE:DNA ), a Boston-based bioengineering company, is ranked sell by four of the six analysts who cover it. Losses are narrowing, but analysts don't expect a profit before 2027. CNX Resources Corp. ( NYSE:CNX ) gets eight sell ratings from the 13 analysts who follow it. Based in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, it produces and transports natural gas in the Appalachian Basin. Finally, AMC Networks Inc. ( NASDAQ:AMCX ) is considered a sell by three of the five analysts who venture an opinion. I have a hunch the analysts darlings can beat their pariahs in 2025. But it's hard to be sure. And that is precisely the point. John Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments LLC in Boston, Massachusetts, and a syndicated columnist.

Kayode Omotosho Tue, Jan 7, 2025, 12:01 PM 3 min read In This Article: AMCX -1.87% Three Reasons to Avoid AMCX and One Stock to Buy Instead AMC Networks has been treading water for the past six months, recording a small return of 3.4% while holding steady at $9.70. This is close to the S&P 500\u2019s 7.3% gain during that period. Is now the time to buy AMC Networks, or should you be careful about including it in your portfolio? Dive into our full research report to see our analyst team\u2019s opinion, it\u2019s free . We don't have much confidence in AMC Networks. Here are three reasons why you should be careful with AMCX and a stock we'd rather own. Why Do We Think AMC Networks Will Underperform? Originally the joint-venture of four cable television companies, AMC Networks (NASDAQ:AMCX) is a broadcaster producing a diverse range of television shows and movies. 1. Revenue Spiraling Downwards A company\u2019s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Over the last five years, AMC Networks\u2019s demand was weak and its revenue declined by 3.9% per year. This was below our standards and is a sign of poor business quality. AMC Networks Quarterly Revenue 2. Cash Flow Margin Set to Decline If you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills. Over the next year, analysts predict AMC Networks\u2019s cash conversion will fall. Their consensus estimates imply its free cash flow margin of 14.4% for the last 12 months will decrease to 10.7%. 3. New Investments Fail to Bear Fruit as ROIC Declines ROIC, or return on invested capital, is a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity). We typically prefer to invest in companies with high returns because it means they have viable business models, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is often what surprises the market and moves the stock price. Unfortunately, AMC Networks\u2019s ROIC has decreased over the last few years. Paired with its already low returns, these declines suggest its profitable growth opportunities are few and far between. AMC Networks Trailing 12-Month Return On Invested Capital Final Judgment We cheer for all companies serving everyday consumers, but in the case of AMC Networks, we\u2019ll be cheering from the sidelines. That said, the stock currently trades at 1.8\u00d7 forward price-to-earnings (or $9.70 per share). While this valuation is optically cheap, the potential downside is huge given its shaky fundamentals. There are more exciting stocks to buy at the moment. We\u2019d suggest looking at TransDigm, a dominant Aerospace business that has perfected its M&A strategy . Story Continues Stocks We Would Buy Instead of AMC Networks With rates dropping, inflation stabilizing, and the elections in the rearview mirror, all signs point to the start of a new bull run - and we\u2019re laser-focused on finding the best stocks for this upcoming cycle.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our 9 Best Market-Beating Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Hidden Gem Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Networks (AMCX) Tops Q3 Earnings and Revenue Estimates Zacks Equity Research Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 5:45 PM 3 min read In This Article: AMCX -1.87% DLB +0.49% AMC Networks (AMCX) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.91 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.86 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.85 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5.81%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this owner of cable channels including AMC and IFC would post earnings of $1.38 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.24, delivering a surprise of -10.14%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. AMC Networks , which belongs to the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, posted revenues of $599.61 million for the quarter ended September 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.29%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $636.95 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. AMC Networks shares have lost about 55.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 25.2%. What's Next for AMC Networks? While AMC Networks has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for AMC Networks: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

{"text": "Celestica and AMC Networks have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day Zacks Equity Research Fri, Dec 20, 2024, 4:22 PM 12 min read In This Article: RGTIW -0.74% AMCX -1.87% CLS -2.10% For Immediate Release Chicago, IL \u2013 December 20, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares Celestica CLS as the Bull of the Day and AMC Networks AMCX as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Rigetti Computing RGTI, Microsoft MSFT and NVIDIA NVDA . Here is a synopsis of all five stocks. Bull of the Day: Celestica , a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is one of the largest electronics manufacturing companies in the world. This company provides supply chain solutions in North America, Europe, as well as Asia. The stock is displaying relative strength, breaking out to the upside amid a bullish move that pushed shares to new all-time highs. The price movement is a sign of strength as we approach the New Year. Increasing volume has attracted investor attention as buying pressure accumulates in this top-ranked stock. Celestica is part of the Zacks Electronics \u2013 Manufacturing Services industry group, which currently ranks in the top 6% out of more than 250 industries. Because this group is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect it to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months, just as it has over the prior 3 months. Historical research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock\u2019s price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. It\u2019s no secret that investing in stocks that are part of leading industry groups can give us a leg up relative to the market. By focusing on leading stocks within the top industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success. Company Description Celestica provides a range of services such as new product design and development, engineering and component sourcing, complex mechanical assembly, systems integration, and logistics. The company has also been involved in the AI movement in terms of delivering platform solutions, which includes development of infrastructure platforms along with hardware and software design services. Celestica offers their products and services to hyperscalers, cloud-based providers, and original equipment manufacturers. The company serves a variety of industries such as aerospace and defense, industrial, capital equipment, and communication markets. Earnings Trends and Future Estimates A leading electronics manufacturer, Celestica (CLS) has built up an impressive reporting history and hasn\u2019t missed the earnings mark in many years. The company has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings beat of 13.2%. Story Continues Back in October, Celestica reported third-quarter earnings of $1.04 per share, a 10.6% surprise over the $0.94/share consensus estimate. Revenues of $2.5 billion also exceeded projections by 3.7%. Analysts are bullish on the stock and have been raising earnings estimates across the board. The fourth-quarter consensus EPS estimate has been revised upward in the past 60 days by 7.22% to $1.04/share. If the company is able to achieve this, it would translate to a 36.8% growth rate versus the same quarter last year. Let\u2019s Get Technical This market leader has seen its stock advance more than 200% in 2024 alone. Only stocks that are in extremely powerful uptrends are able to experience this type of outperformance. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio \u2013 one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions. Notice how both the 50-day (blue line) and 200-day (red line) moving averages are sloping up. The stock has been making a series of higher highs throughout the year. With both strong fundamental and technical indicators, CLS stock is poised to continue its outperformance. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. As we know, Celestica has recently witnessed positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and CLS continues to deliver earnings beats), the stock will likely continue its bullish run. Bottom Line Backed by a leading industry group and history of earnings beats, it\u2019s not difficult to see why Celestica stock is a compelling investment. Robust fundamentals combined with an appealing technical trend certainly justify adding shares to the mix. Recent positive earnings estimate revisions should also serve to create a \u2018floor\u2019 in terms of any sudden or unexpected downside moves. If you haven\u2019t already done so, be sure to put CLS on your shortlist. Bear of the Day: AMC Networks is a global provider of video entertainment products that are delivered to audiences, advertisers, and a platform of distributors. The company operates various national programming networks including the AMC, We tv, BBC AMERICA, IFC and Sundance TV. AMC Networks also provides a suite of subscription streaming services such as AMC+, Shudder, Sundance Now, and Acorn TV. In addition, the company is engaged in the film distribution business under the IFC Films, RLJ Entertainment Films, and Shudder brands. The stock was recently downgraded by analysts at Morgan Stanley, who cited weak pricing power given the company\u2019s smaller scale. As we\u2019ll see, the consensus trend for earnings estimates shows a clear negative tilt. The Zacks Rundown AMC Networks, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock, is a component of the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry group, which currently ranks in the bottom 48% out of approximately 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. As such, we expect this industry group as a whole to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. Stocks in the bottom tiers of industries can often be intriguing short candidates. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when they\u2019re part of a lagging industry, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies and the journey forward is that much more difficult. AMCX shares have been underperforming this year while the general market returned to new heights. The stock is hitting a series of lower lows and represents a compelling short opportunity as we approach the New Year. Despite a quarterly earnings beat back in November, the company\u2019s bottom line fell 50.8% year-over-year. Affiliate revenue decreased 13% due to basic subscriber declines, while advertising revenues fell 10% amid a challenging ad market and linear ratings declines. Past Earnings Misses & Deteriorating Outlook AMC Networks has fallen short of earnings estimates in two of the past three quarters. The company has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of -6.8%. Consistently falling short of earnings estimates is a recipe for underperformance, and AMCX is no exception. The entertainment company has been on the receiving end of negative earnings estimate revisions as of late. Looking ahead to fiscal 2025, analysts have slashed estimates by a whopping -37% in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate is now $3.15 per share, reflecting negative growth of -23% relative to the prior year. Falling earnings estimates are a huge red flag and need to be respected. Negative growth year-over-year is the type of trend that bears like to see. Technical Outlook AMCX stock is in a sustained downtrend. Notice how the stock has made a series of lower lows, widely underperforming the major indices. Also note that shares are trading below a downward-sloping 200-day moving average \u2013 another good sign for the bears. AMCX stock has experienced what is known as a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d whereby the stock\u2019s 50-day moving average (blue line) crosses below its 200-day moving average. The stock would have to make an outsized move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions. Shares have fallen more than 50% this year alone. Final Thoughts A deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock is not set to make its way to new highs anytime soon. The fact that AMCX is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups adds yet another headwind to a long list of concerns. A history of earnings misses and falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock\u2019s downtrend. Potential investors may want to give this stock the cold shoulder, or perhaps include it as part of a short or hedge strategy. Bulls will want to steer clear of AMCX until the situation shows major signs of improvement. Additional content: Rigetti Computing Surges +692% in a Month: Is There More Room Higher?

As the quantum computing market continues to evolve, RGTI is poised to benefit from its growth. Per a Grand View Research report, the quantum computing market is expected to witness a CAGR of 20.1% from 2024 to 2030. Rigetti Suffers From Quantum Market Challenges Rigetti\u2019s advancements in the quantum computing space are continuously benefiting the company\u2019s top-line growth. However, challenging macroeconomic uncertainties and intense competition in the rapidly evolving and highly competitive quantum computing market have negatively impacted the company\u2019s top-line growth. In the third quarter of 2024, revenues decreased to $2.4 million, down from $3.1 million in the same period of the prior year. This drop was attributed to the variable nature of contract deliverables, especially with major government agencies, which led to fluctuating revenue streams. Gross margin fell significantly to 51% in the third quarter of 2024 from 73% in the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was partly due to a contract for a 24-qubit quantum system, which had a lower gross margin profile compared to most other revenue sources. RGTI\u2019s Earnings Estimate Showing Steady Trend The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $2.40 million, indicating a decline of 28.99% year over year. The consensus mark is currently pegged at a loss of 8 cents per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. Rigetti Computing, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Rigetti Computing, Inc.

provider of video entertainment products that are delivered to audiences, advertisers, and a platform of distributors. The company operates various national programming networks including the AMC, We tv, BBC AMERICA, IFC, and Sundance TV. AMC Networks also provides a suite of subscription streaming services such as AMC+, Shudder, Sundance Now, and Acorn TV. In addition, the company is engaged in the film distribution business under the IFC Films, RLJ Entertainment Films, and Shudder brands. The stock was recently downgraded by analysts at Morgan Stanley, who cited weak pricing power given the company\u2019s smaller scale. As we\u2019ll see, the consensus trend for earnings estimates shows a clear negative tilt. The Zacks Rundown AMC Networks AMCX, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock, is a component of the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry group, which currently ranks in the bottom 48% out of approximately 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. As such, we expect this industry group as a whole to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. Stocks in the bottom tiers of industries can often be intriguing short candidates. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when they\u2019re part of a lagging industry, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies and the journey forward is that much more difficult. AMCX shares have been underperforming this year while the general market returned to new heights. The stock is hitting a series of lower lows and represents a compelling short opportunity as we approach the New Year. Despite a quarterly earnings beat back in November, the company\u2019s bottom line fell 50.8% year-over-year. Affiliate revenue decreased 13% due to basic subscriber declines, while advertising revenues fell 10% amid a challenging ad market and linear ratings declines. Past Earnings Misses & Deteriorating Outlook AMC Networks has fallen short of earnings estimates in two of the past three quarters. The company has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of -6.8%. Consistently falling short of earnings estimates is a recipe for underperformance, and AMCX is no exception. The entertainment company has been on the receiving end of negative earnings estimate revisions as of late. Looking ahead to fiscal 2025, analysts have slashed estimates by a whopping -37% in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate is now $3.15 per share, reflecting negative growth of -23% relative to the prior year. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Story Continues Falling earnings estimates are a huge red flag and need to be respected. Negative growth year-over-year is the type of trend that bears like to see. Technical Outlook As illustrated below, AMCX stock is in a sustained downtrend. Notice how the stock has made a series of lower lows, widely underperforming the major indices. Also note that shares are trading below a downward-sloping 200-day (red line) moving average \u2013 another good sign for the bears. StockCharts Image Source: StockCharts AMCX stock has experienced what is known as a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d whereby the stock\u2019s 50-day moving average (blue line) crosses below its 200-day moving average. The stock would have to make an outsized move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions. Shares have fallen more than 50% this year alone. Final Thoughts A deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock is not set to make its way to new highs anytime soon. The fact that AMCX is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups adds yet another headwind to a long list of concerns. A history of earnings misses and falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock\u2019s downtrend. Potential investors may want to give this stock the cold shoulder, or perhaps include it as part of a short or hedge strategy. Bulls will want to steer clear of AMCX until the situation shows major signs of improvement. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Market Update As a result of the Fed's rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has come down from frothy levels post-pandemic. The general rise in the price of goods and services is trending towards the Fed's 2% goal as of late, which is good news. The higher rates that fought inflation also didn't slow economic activity enough to catalyze a recession. So far, soft landing. This, combined with recent rate cuts (half a percent in September 2024 and a quarter percent in November 2024) have led to strong stock market performance in 2024. The icing on the cake for 2024 returns was Donald Trump's victory in the US Presidential Election in early November, sending major indices to all-time highs in the week following the election. Still, debates around the health of the economy and the impact of potential tariffs and corporate tax cuts remain. Said differently, there's still much uncertainty around 2025.
