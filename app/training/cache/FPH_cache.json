[{"text": "Five Point Holdings, LLC (FPH): A Bull Case Theory Ricardo Pillai Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 9:16 PM 3 min read In This Article: FPH -5.63% We came across a bullish thesis on Five Point Holdings, LLC (FPH) on Substack by Dominick D'Angelo. In this article, we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on FPH. Five Point Holdings, LLC (FPH)'s share was trading at $5.75 as of Jan 24 th . FPH\u2019s trailing P/E was 5.99 according to Yahoo Finance. An aerial view of the largest real estate development in the city, symbolizing the company's success. Five Point Holdings (FPH) has delivered a remarkable turnaround, as evidenced by its Q4 results and 2025 guidance that far exceeded expectations. Under the leadership of a consistently strong management team, the company has made impressive strides in property sales, debt reduction, and operational efficiency, while unlocking significant value from its real estate portfolio. The recent results showcased record property sales across its Great Park and Valencia communities, with notable price increases per acre. Great Park alone reported a 23% rise in per-acre sales compared to Q2 2024, achieving $9.6 million per acre with a 75% gross margin. Valencia, although less developed, also contributed meaningfully, underscoring Five Point's ability to generate value from diverse assets. Additionally, the sale of the last Gateway Commercial Venture property simplifies the corporate structure, further strengthening the balance sheet. Looking ahead, Five Point\u2019s 2025 outlook is equally promising. The company\u2019s strategy to rezone commercial land into residential at Great Park could unlock $600 million in value, with Five Point\u2019s share estimated at $225 million. Contracts for new residential programs are advancing, with multiple closings expected this year. Valencia\u2019s ongoing efforts to increase housing density address California\u2019s critical housing shortage, positioning the community for growth. Meanwhile, the long-overlooked San Francisco property has emerged as a cornerstone of Five Point\u2019s future. With rezoning and separation from Hunters Point complete, construction is set to begin in 2026, marking a pivotal shift for this previously stagnant asset. Debt reduction remains a priority, with plans to decrease leverage by $100\u2013$200 million in 2025, alongside potential refinancing of existing debt. Management expects to generate $200 million in net income this year, achieving a net cash position that enables future growth opportunities. The evolving homebuilding landscape, where developers like Five Point take on land development responsibilities, presents new opportunities for the company. A shift toward a \u201cland-light\u201d model, exemplified by the Great Park structure, will allow Five Point to operate efficiently, with management fees offsetting annual SG&A costs. Story Continues Despite the significant progress, the market still undervalues Five Point, creating an attractive entry point for investors. The San Francisco asset, once dismissed, is now a driver of substantial upside, with fair value estimated north of $8 per share and the potential to exceed $10 as its contributions materialize. With bankruptcy concerns now firmly in the rearview mirror, Five Point is well-positioned for continued growth and long-term value creation.

Positive Points Five Point Holdings LLC ( NYSE:FPH ) reported a record-breaking net income of $121 million for the fourth quarter, marking their seventh consecutive quarter of profitability. The company successfully closed all anticipated essential land sales in Valencia and Great Park, generating significant revenue. FPH maintained disciplined cost management, keeping SG&A expenses flat year-over-year at $14.2 million for the fourth quarter. The company ended the year with strong liquidity of $555.9 million, comprising cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing. FPH is well-positioned for future growth, with expectations of a 10% increase in net income for 2025, driven by continued land sales and strategic initiatives. Negative Points The macroeconomic environment remains challenging, with mixed signals from interest rates and inflation impacting the housing market. Insurance availability in California poses a potential risk, particularly for larger attached building projects, due to recent fires. Sales in Valencia have not exceeded 100 homes per quarter, indicating slower demand despite quicker lot sales. The commercial land side of the business is more rate-sensitive, and the company is evaluating opportunities to replan some commercial sites for residential use. FPH's senior notes are set to increase in interest rate, which may impact financial flexibility if not addressed through refinancing or paydown. Q & A Highlights Q : How might the recent fires in California impact the insurance market and Five Point's operations? A : Dan Hedigan, CEO, noted that insurance availability is a concern in California, but Five Point's master-planned communities have proven resilient due to their fire-resistant designs. The company anticipates that the state will manage insurance availability carefully, and they plan to focus on individual insurance policies rather than large buildings. Story Continues Q : Can you provide more details on the strategy for the San Francisco development and the expected capital outlay? A : Dan Hedigan, CEO, explained that the initial focus is on horizontal development, with engineering planned for this year and construction starting early next year. The company is financially positioned to fund this phase, and they are exploring options for the vertical development, potentially involving joint ventures. Q : How does Five Point plan to address the upcoming increase in coupon rates on their notes? A : Kim Tobler, CFO, stated that the company is considering refinancing options and believes their improved financial position makes them a better credit risk. They are also contemplating paying down the notes to reduce interest costs. Q : What is the company's approach to new ventures and potential equity investments? A : Mike Alvarado, COO, indicated that Five Point expects to have some equity investment in new ventures, though likely smaller than their current 37.5% interest in the Great Park. This approach aligns with their strategy to maintain an asset-lighter model. Q : Why hasn't demand at Valencia exceeded 100 homes per quarter, and what is the impact of the nearby landfill? A : Dan Hedigan, CEO, explained that the limited number of active programs has constrained sales, but new programs opening this year should increase product diversity and sales. The landfill has not impacted sales, and it has reportedly closed as of December 31. For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .

Positive Points CSX Corp ( NASDAQ:CSX ) achieved 2% volume growth for the year, outpacing the industrial economy. The company delivered strong, consistent customer service, leading to a high Net Promoter Score. CSX Corp ( NASDAQ:CSX ) led the rail industry in reaching early agreements with labor unions on 5-year contracts. Operational improvements resulted in significant fuel efficiency gains, saving millions of dollars. The Howard Street Tunnel project is expected to be completed much faster than originally planned, enhancing future operational capabilities. Negative Points Quarterly revenue declined by 4% due to lower global coal prices and a decline in fuel surcharge. Earnings per share declined 7% on an adjusted basis, excluding goodwill impairment effects. The company faced substantial headwinds from hurricanes and lower commodity prices, impacting financial performance. Coal revenue declined 20% for the quarter due to reduced global benchmark pricing and production issues. The Blue Ridge and Howard Street Tunnel projects will add significant expenses throughout the year. Q & A Highlights Q : How do you think about full-year margin performance given the headwinds in the first half of the year? A : Sean Pelkey, CFO, explained that margin improvement is unlikely in the first half due to concentrated headwinds, especially in Q1. However, he anticipates potential growth in operating income and margins in the second half, assuming a stable operating environment and easing of headwinds. Q : Do you expect to grow operating income this year despite the challenges? A : Sean Pelkey, CFO, noted that without the $350 million headwinds, CSX would see solid growth in operating income. However, due to utility coal headwinds and mine issues, growth might be towards the lower end of the mid- to high single-digit range, with a rebound expected in subsequent years. Story Continues Q : Have there been any changes in customer conversations regarding the industrial development pipeline post-election? A : Kevin Boone, EVP of Sales and Marketing, stated that contrary to expectations of a pause, there has been healthy activity with new projects coming in. The team remains busy, and they anticipate acceleration with potential policy changes. Q : Can you discuss the impact of tightening truck capacity and its reflection in results? A : Kevin Boone, EVP of Sales and Marketing, highlighted that intermodal is the most obvious area affected, but there's also work on merchandise side truck conversions. He expects discussions to accelerate as customers seek cost savings, with potential benefits in intermodal pricing as the year progresses. Q : What are the long-term benefits of the Howard Street Tunnel project and other infrastructure improvements? A : Joseph Hinrichs, CEO, emphasized that the Howard Street Tunnel project will enable double stacking along the East Coast, enhancing CSX's competitive position. The project, along with other improvements, is expected to yield significant benefits in 2026 and 2027, supporting volume growth and efficiency.

Dan Hedigan, Chief Executive Officer, said, \"I am pleased to report that we finished 2024 strong, with consolidated net income for the quarter of $121.0 million, giving us consolidated net income for the year of $177.6 million and total cash and cash equivalents of $430.9 million and total liquidity of $555.9 million as of year-end. This is our seventh consecutive quarter reporting net income, and the net income numbers for the quarter and the full year represent new high-water marks for the Company. Story Continues During the quarter, we saw multiple significant residential land sales close at both our Valencia and Great Park Neighborhoods communities, and our Gateway Commercial Venture sold its remaining interests in the Five Point Gateway Campus to City of Hope. Although the interest rate environment is still uncertain, homebuilder demand for our land remains strong. Successful execution on our key operating priorities over the past few years has positioned us to seek out new growth opportunities, which will be an important initiative for the Company in 2025. Based on our current expectations, we believe that we will see consolidated annual net income for 2025 exceed 2024, with annual earnings growth of approximately 10%, bringing us close to $200 million in net income.\" Consolidated Results Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2024, total liquidity of $555.9 million was comprised of cash and cash equivalents totaling $430.9 million and borrowing availability of $125.0 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility.

(2) Net debt to total capitalization is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net debt (debt less cash and cash equivalents) divided by total net capitalization (net debt plus total capital). The Company believes the ratio of net debt to total capitalization is a relevant and a useful financial measure to investors in understanding the leverage employed in the Company\u2019s operations. However, because net debt to total capitalization is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, this financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures prescribed by GAAP. Rather, this non-GAAP financial measure should be used to supplement the Company\u2019s GAAP results.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our call. I have with me today, Mike Alvarado, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Legal Officer; Kim Tobler, our Chief Financial Officer; and Leo Kij, our Senior Vice President of Finance and Reporting. I'm getting over a small cold, so excuse my voice if it sounds a little different. Before I get into the business side of our call, I want to take a moment to express on behalf of myself and Five Point, are sadness for those affected by the devastating fires in Los Angeles. While our communities were not directly affected by the fires, our Blanche community is situated nearby the Hughes Fire near Castaic Lake that broke out yesterday, but has now been largely contained and evacuation zones never extended to our community. Although our Southern California communities are further to North and to the South of the areas affected by the Palisades fires, we showed the deep sense of loss that permeates all of Southern California. Like many organizations and individuals, we have been working with public officials agencies and industry partners to assist the families impacted by these fires as well as the courageous firefighters and first responders who work tirelessly to protect lives and property. Although our communities were not directly impacted, we fully expect to be part of the many solutions that will build a bridge to a better future for Southern California -- begin with philothropic contributions. We're also well aware of the significant effort it will take for the County of Los Angeles and other relevant agencies to support the rebuilding of the affected areas. Five Point will be there to support the county and its rebuilding efforts, as we expect that expedited actions and approvals will enable a swift response to current needs. As a company that is deeply involved in building fire resistant and resilient mixed-use communities, we stand ready to provide expertise and execution as needed. So with that said, let me begin. On today's call, I will update you on our record-breaking fourth quarter and our year-end results. Additionally, I will review Five Point's go-forward operating strategy, our team's focus during the quarter; and then finally, our strategic priorities and expectations for 2025. Mike will then discuss the growth element of our operating strategy. After which, Tim will give an overview of the company's financial performance and condition with guidance for the first quarter of 2025 and the full year. We'll then open the line for questions. Turning to the fourth quarter. I'm pleased to report another very successful quarter for Five Point, as we continue to build a program of consistent profitability with a defined pathway to growth for our future. In the fourth quarter, we generated stronger than expected net income of $121 million, which is a record for quarterly income for us and is our seventh consecutive quarter reporting net income, as we remained focused on generating revenue controlling our expenses and managing our capital spend. During the three months ended December 31, 2024, we're able to close all of our anticipated essential land sales. In Valencia, we closed four new home programs, totaling 493 home sites on 54.4 acres to four distinct builders for an aggregate purchase price of $137.9 million. And at the -- Great Park, the venture closed five new home programs with 372 home sites on 32.2 acres to a single builder, aggregate purchase price of $309.3 million. As a result of Great park operations during the quarter, we received $121.5 million in distributions, incentive compensation payments from The Great Park Venture. Additionally, we had a singular Commercial closing as a Gateway Venture closed on the sale of its remaining interest in the Five Point Gateway Campus during the fourth quarter and distributed proceeds to its members with Five Point receiving $17.2 million. Kim will discuss all these transactions further in his report. Even while achieving record net income levels, we remain disciplined and focused on managing costs and held our fourth quarter SG&A to $14.2 million and full year SG&A to $51.2 million, which is flat year-over-year. We remain -- vigilant about managing an excellent business with tightly controlled overhead even as we look to expand our business. In addition to managing SG&A, we have carefully matched the expenditure of development dollars in close coordination with expected revenue recognition. This has enabled us to maximize gas generation. I want to thank everyone on our team as well as our partners at Great Park Venture who have been focused and supportive, as we executed this critical element of our business strategy. Alongside our successful fourth quarter, I'm also happy to announce, the reporting record net income for the full year of $177.6 million. We finished the year with total liquidity of $555.9 million comprised of cash and cash equivalents totaling $430.9 million and borrowing available $125 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility. As we look ahead to 2025, we remain well positioned to continue executing on land sales to our guest builders at The Great Park Neighborhood and Valencia. The completion of our rebalancing efforts in San Francisco has put us in a good position to start development of our Candlestick community, while the progression of our entitlements at Valencia positions us to extend our pipeline of home sites in that master planned community. Given our successful results in 2024, an expectation of continued success in 2025, we feel we are well positioned to move forward on implementation of growth initiatives to complement our three existing communities. These (inaudible) mixtures represent an expansion of the operating strategy we have been executing for the past four years. Our expanded operating strategy now consists of four key elements: one, we'll continue to operate and maximize value on our existing three premier master planned communities. Two, we'll continue to carefully manage overhead even while we grow our bottom line. Three, we'll continue to match development expenditures with revenue generation. And four, finally, we have begun to seek capital partners for new acquisitions through joint ventures to ensure a growing future for Five Point. To that end, our existing Great Park Venture model is one that we believe can be repeat it for new acquisitions as we grow Five Point into a best-in-class asset lighter, land partnership and development company. We'll discuss this in more detail later in the call. So what does all this great work suggest for Five Point for the new year. We currently expect that our earnings for 2025 will exceed 2024. We expect to see earnings growth of approximately 10%, bringing us close to $200 million in net income with the caveat that our expectation is that -- processes within County of Los Angeles will function as we hoped going into the year. Our focus will be on building a platform that produces recurring earnings along with sustainable long-term growth. Kim will provide more detail about our guidance for 2025 during his remarks. I'd like to now touch on market conditions, and I'm pleased to note that we are able to achieve record-breaking 2024 results, even though the macroeconomic environment remains somewhat challenging. Although the Federal Reserve has cut rates by 100 basis points in September, interest rates and inflation have continued to send mixed signals with key mortgage interest rates moving mostly higher during the quarter. We remain mindful of potential impacts to affordability created by mortgage rates. Most of our guest builders have been able to mitigate the impacts of higher rates through the use of a variety of incentive structures, including mortgage rate buy-downs. Although interest rates are a key data point in the housing market, California generally, and our community specifically remain in chronically undersupplied residential land markets, primarily due to California's challenging and restrictive land use approval process. The devastating fires in Los Angeles County will only exacerbate the undersupply in Southern California as displaced residents look for alternative housing options. We currently expect that there will be a relief from some of the restrictive approval processes to allow quicker access to available land inventory in our communities and across the state to assist with these housing options. We also expect that shortage of entitled land and existing inventory will continue to drive strong demand for more homes from our builders. The Commercial land side of our business continues to be more rate-sensitive in residential. Accordingly, given the depth of demand and value being (inaudible) by residential uses, we have been evaluating opportunities in The Great Park Neighborhoods to replan some of our commercial sites for residential use under City of Irvine recently adopted (inaudible) program. We'll have more to report on this effort in the coming quarters. Let me now provide you with some updates on our communities, starting first with The Great Park Neighborhoods. As a reminder, The Great Part is the most mature of our communities and its ongoing contribution to our financial results reflects the benefits that we and our -- Great Park Venture partners are receiving from the investments made in this community in prior years. During the fourth quarter, builders of Great Park community sold 143 homes versus 166 in Q3. This decrease in sales was primarily attributable to seasonality. We currently have 14 actively selling programs in Great Park Neighborhoods with five additional programs planned to open later this year. With the existing and future plan programs, we'll be able to continue to offer a wide variety of housing options in Great Park Neighborhoods. In addition to high levels of homebuyer interest, we're still seeing strong from builders for our land at the Great Park. We have finalized contracts with three builders for five different residential programs, that are planned to close in the first half of 2025. four of these sales are currently planning to close in the first quarter and the final one in quarter two. The contracted sales prices are consistent with or higher than our most recent sales. As discussed on our last call, we have also completed the bidding process for a group of nine new residential programs totaling 572 homes. Builders are completing due diligence with the expectation that these land sales will close in the fourth quarter of this year. We received strong interest in all nine programs and awarded the sites to six different builders. The offered sales prices are also consistent or higher than our most recent sales. As I mentioned earlier, the City of Irvine completed state-mandated RHNA, General and (inaudible) updates for the -- Great Park plain area, which will provide a great part venture with the opportunity to convert some or substantial portions of its remaining commercial land holdings to residential uses. We're continuing to study these options and have initiated discussions with the city to consider residential uses consistent with the renal program adopted by the city. Next, I'll move to Valencia, our other active community. As a reminder, Valencia is in the early stages of a development, it still has many future phases of land delivery ahead of it -- with which will enable us to provide much unit housing in the Los Angeles market. During the fourth quarter, home sales remained relatively steady after accounting for seasonality, as our guest builders sold 74 new homes versus 89 in Q3. During the fourth quarter, two programs sold out in Valencia, and we now have six builder programs open and active (inaudible). Additionally, from the land we sold at the end of 2023 there are seven programs that we anticipate will open during 2025, offering a greater diversity of home offerings for prospective homebuyers. As I mentioned, we closed all of our projected land sales for the fourth quarter. During the first quarter, we'll take approximately 200 more homes sites to market, anticipating that those sales will close towards the end of the year. As we look at our next phases of development at Valencia, we continue to work for Los Angeles County and other agencies on approvals to allow us to deliver thousands of additional home sites in the counties severely undersupplied market. One of these development areas is known as Entrata South which is expected to consist of approximately 116 net acres, a residential and over 1,300 market-rate home sites and approximately 44 net acres of commercial land. Another development area is Valencia Commerce Center, which is expected to include approximately 139 net acres (inaudible) towards industrial-focused uses (inaudible) the County approval of these development areas later this year. We're also concurrently processing additional approvals of accounting under statewide pro housing legislation for three other development areas that are planned to provide approximately 7,600 home sites to this very supply-constrained market. As part of the approvals in these new development areas, we'll continue to implement fire resistance and fire mitigation strategies like we have been doing in our master planned communities for many years. These strategies are typically designed to mitigate wildfire risk, and have proven to be successful in protecting homes in these master planned communities from the unfortunate devastation we've recently seen in older communities. Turning to San Francisco. The city and county and other applicable regulatory agencies have given final approval to our plan to rebalance the (inaudible) between our two San Francisco communities, Candlestick and The Shipyard. We're excited about the near-term possibility of Candlestick and we have commenced engineering for the initial fade infrastructure, with the expectation of starting construction early next year, allowing us to unlock the value of the spectacular (inaudible) land in the City of San Francisco. Let me conclude by saying my optimism about the future of Five Point continues to grow. Our fourth quarter and year-end results represent our continued focus on three main priorities: generating revenue and positive cash flow controlling SG&A and managing capital spend to match near-term revenue opportunities. Execution on these key providers has resulted in a stronger balance sheet and growing liquidity. As a result, we're able to focus more attention on growth opportunities as we continue to work towards an asset-lighter land partnership and development model. Now let me turn it over to Mike, who will discuss Five Point's growth opportunities. Story Continues Mike Alvarado Thanks, Dan. Let me briefly report where Five Point sees opportunities to grow our business. As Dan noted, with the success of 2024 and our expectations for '25, Five Point is now in the enviable position of pursuing growth opportunities. And as much as homebuilders are following the path of growth in population and job centers, they continue to implement longer-term land acquisition strategies. These longer-term land acquisition and development projects do not lend themselves to a land-light strategy that a number of publicly traded homebuilders are now gravitating towards. This dynamic gives Five Point the opportunity to work alongside the builders in these paths of growth in a win-win scenario that allows (inaudible) from one development area to another to meet market timing and demand. Because of our execution on such large-scale projects, as well as our ability to leverage our existing relationships with the public homebuilders [ where ] we regularly engage -- we will have the opportunity to expand this part of our business. Indeed, Five Point has all the infrastructure in place span as part of our business, leadership purchasing and contracting, land development, financing, accounting, legal, et cetera. That said, new acquisitions do not necessarily need to be at the same size sales or scale as our existing communities. While the public builders are following the path of new growth in certain markets, there is substantial demand for housing in existing urban areas where housing demand has greatly exceeded supply. To that end, we have already been seeing opportunities for value-add land acquisitions that are infill and thus smaller in scale. The re-purposing of land and housing constrained areas will be a market on which we focus. Whether an infill site or a new development area, we likely will be targeting opportunities that are more midterm end holdings versus the much longer hold periods required for large-scale master planned communities. Given the now urgent need for housing in Southern California markets and with our expertise and the expedited approval processes needed for new housing, we can add value to the public agencies and community in order to facilitate this much needed housing. As (inaudible) discussed in the past, we believe the Great Park Venture business model is one that can be repeated, not only within our other existing communities, but also in future projects as we consider the growth of Five Point. To remind you, this model is one in which we own an equity interest in the venture provide management services to the venture, and have the ability to earn an incentive promoted interest for excellent performance. Bringing in Capital Partners reduces our capital investment and gives Five Point opportunities to move to an asset-lighter balance sheet model under a well-crafted partnership program. Management fee income should be offset -- should offset our SG&A and the promoted income interest aligns our interests or embedding a system of accountability to drive performance. We have a prudent track record with the Great Park Venture, whose members have seen rising returns over the last several years driven by a combination of our management of the asset and the active engagement of the partners. We believe this is a business model that we can take advantage of, as we look at other opportunities for future growth of the company. While we don't have any transactions to report at this time, we anticipate sharing new opportunities with you before the end of the year. To assist us in sourcing new capital and structuring potential joint ventures, we have extended the engagement of our former CEO, Emile Haddad, under a modified incentive base consulting arrangement. As Founder, Chairman Emeritus and immediate past CEO of Five Point Emile has a unique and deep understanding of Five Point in the markets in which we operate. Additionally, in his role as Lennar's former Chief Investment Officer, Mr. Haddad oversaw Lennar's land investments and led construction of joint ventures such as Heritage Fields, the venture that is the owner and developer of the Great Park Neighborhoods in Irvine. Between sourcing capital providers in the land development space and bringing his expertise in structuring these arrangements, we expect Emile Haddad to accelerate Five Point's growth strategy prospects over the next few years. Now let me turn it over to Kim to report on our financial results for the quarter. Kim Tobler Thank you, Mike. As Dan and Mike have shared, we finished an exciting year well and are positioned to grow in the coming years. I'm going to review our fourth quarter and annual results for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. And then I'd like to give some additional background regarding the Gateway Commercial Venture, of its remaining interest in the Five Point Gateway Campus. And then I will conclude with the trends we've seen from 2022 to 2024 with some guidance of what we are expecting in 2025. In the fourth quarter, we recognized $121 million of net income. This was made up of the following components; $137.9 million of residential land sales at our Valencia project, we are reporting a 34.7% gross margin, which results in the (inaudible) sales of $91.1 million. We also had $21.4 million of management services revenue, $18.3 million of that, which is associated with the incentive compensation from the Great Park. Our fourth quarter SG&A was $14.2 million. And we recognized $87.5 million of equity and earnings from our unconsolidated entities, $74.6 million from The Great Park Venture and $13 million from The Gateway Commercial Venture. The equity and earnings from The Great Park Venture was attributable to net income of $217.7 million, which resulted from land sales revenue of $309.3 million and a 75% gross margin. The equity and earnings from the Gateway Commercial Venture is attributable to the sale of the remaining building and other interests that I will discuss in more detail later. Finally, we recognized $18.8 million of tax expense. Now moving to our '24 annual results. As Dan mentioned, 2024 was more successful than 2023, and we are seeing the fruits of the focus and discipline that we have been exercising these last few years. For the year 2024, we recognized $177.6 million of net income that is made up of the following components; $137.9 million of residential land sales at our Valencia project and we're reporting the 34.7% gross margin, which results in cost of sales of $90.1 million. We also had $96.4 million of management services revenue, $84 million of which is associated with the incentive compensation from The Great Park. 2024 SG&A was $51.2 million, which was slightly less than the 2023 SG&A of $51.5 million. We recognized $132.6 million of equity and earnings from our unconsolidated entities, consisting of $119.8 million from The Great Park Venture and $12.3 million from the Gateway Commercial Venture. The equity and earnings from The Great Park Venture was attributable to net income of $349.2 million, which resulted from land sales and price participation revenue of $507.1 million, and a gross margin of $429.1 million. Additionally, we recognized $27.5 million of tax expense. Now a few words about our liquidity and cash. As Dan mentioned, we ended the quarter with $403.9 million of cash, as well as $125 million of availability on our revolving credit facility, resulting in total unity of $555.9 million. At the end of the quarter, our debt to total capitalization was 19.6%. Now I'll turn to a little more detail about The Gateway Commercial Venture and our sale. You may recall Five Point owns 75% of the Gateway Commercial Venture with two of our three other partners in The Great Park Venture. The Gateway Commercial Venture acquired the campus from Broadcom in August of 2017, which included two completed buildings that Broadcom intended to occupy, and two partially completed buildings they did not intend to occupy for a total of approximately one million square feet of research and development and office space -- for $443 million or $426 per square foot. The Gateway Commercial Venture made pursuant to a repurchase option that the Great Park Venture had retained when sold the underlying land to Broadcom in 2015 and later assigned that right to The Gateway Commercial Venture. Following the purchase, subsidiaries of Five Point and the Lennar Corporation leased three of the four floors of one of the unfinished buildings. At the time we entered into The Gateway Commercial Venture, it was an opportunistic investment that was consistent with statements that we had made that we might retain a portion of the commercial or multifamily properties in our communities as income-producing assets. Over the course of holding this asset, we have been presented with a number of opportunities to monetize our investment. As you may recall, in May of 2020, the venture sold the remaining unfinished 181,000 square foot building to City of Hope for $108 million, which they converted into a world-class cancer treatment enter. City of Hope also acquired the right to build a cancer hospital adjacent to the cancer treatment center. In August of 2020, the venture sold the two buildings occupied by Broadcom, a combined 64,100 square feet to an investment group for $355 million. The sale of the final building of which we are a tenant in December of 2024 to City of Hope, completes the monetization of the venture's investment in the campus. The sale included the final 189,000 square foot building and the ability to build up to an additional 189,000 square feet of improvement within the campus, depending upon the specific uses. The consideration for the property was $35 million in cash and a secured interest-bearing note of $43.5 million due in two years for total consideration of $88.5 million. At the time of the sale, the property was subject to a mortgage of $28.8 million, which was retired with the cash proceeds. Even while the commercial office market remains depressed, the implied cap rate for this sale was 5.2%. For the life of the overall investment, we have achieved a levered IRR just under 17% and the blended sales price per square foot for all of the buildings was $550 compared to the acquisition price per square foot of $426. Since the Gateway Commercial Venture was the only asset in our Commercial segment, we are now eliminating that segment. This doesn't mean we will never invest in operating properties again, but it isn't a priority at this time as we prepare to expand our Horizontal Development business. I hope that this is helpful in understanding the sale of that asset. Now I'd like to take a moment to review what we have accomplished financially over the last couple of years. At the end of 2022, we reported a $34.9 million net loss and finished the year with $131.8 million cash and senior notes of $625 million. For 2023, we reported $113.7 million of net income and finished the year with $353.8 million in cash and senior notes still of $625 million. This year, we are reporting $177.6 million of net income. We paid our senior notes down by $100 million to a balance of $525 million, and are ending the year with $430.9 million of cash and total liquidity of $555.9 million. We believe that our hard work and focus are truly paying off, and as Dan and Mike have suggested, we are now on our front foot and preparing to grow while still exhibiting the same work ethic and focus. What makes me even more excited about our current position is one about to share about our expectations for 2025. As Dan mentioned, for 2025, we currently expect to exceed the net income we are reporting for 2024 by approximately 10%, bringing us close to $200 million for the year, and expect to continue our quarterly profitability in Q1 of 2025 with $40 million to $50 million of net income. For the year, we are expecting Valencia's contribution to net income to be slightly less than 2024 and occurring late in the year. This is, of course, subject to LA County's ability to participate as we have expected in the process of approving plans, performing inspections and the like. While it is still early to draw any conclusions regarding impacts from the fires, I am confident that the county will take seriously the need to quickly gear up to keep the housing pipeline moving, after they have dealt with the immediate critical needs that the active fires require. In 2025, we are expecting the majority of our earnings to come from our investment in and management of the Great Park Venture. That contribution will be coming from the future sales beginning in Q1 that Dan gave color on in his comments, and from the continuing price participation at the Luna Park Neighborhood that I have discussed in the past, which is expected to be closing homes through 2025 and finishing in early 2026. Finally, I'm certain that you are interested in what we expect to do with the cash that we have accumulated. While we continue to review our options and to monitor market conditions, but at this time, it is our expectation that we will pay down our senior notes by $100 million to $200 million before the end of the year. With that said, we still expect to have sufficient cash flow to maintain our development at Valencia begin our development at San Francisco and invest in our growth activities. I hope you can tell how excited I am for what 2025 and beyond hold for us. With that, let me turn it back to the operator, who will now open it up for questions. Question and Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions) Alan Ratner, Zelman & Associates. Alan Ratner Wow, congrats on all the progress this year. It's really amazing what you guys have been able to do here in terms of the consistency now of the cash flow and the income. It's great to see. I'm happy to hear that you guys at least were not directly impacted by the fires, and I think it makes a lot of sense that your projects could be potential beneficiaries of the rebuild or at least a role in that process. I am curious, though, just in terms of -- I know it's early, but you've -- Dan, you flagged the challenges of insurance in the state of California in the past. I think you even mentioned one quarter or two ago having to kind of refigure a little bit some of the attached versus detached split of your business in Valencia. And I'm just curious, based on your conversations you're having so far, whether you think that this unfortunate event would be a catalyst for further tightening of that insurance market and potentially create some challenges for you guys as well as obviously the homebuilding community within California going forward? Dan Hedigan Well, thanks, Alan. Insurance is obviously going to be a question that's (inaudible) a lot in the state of California. And you're right, because of insurance availability, we have moved away from our builders have really moved away from large tax buildings where multiple units could be at risk to nothing more than a duplex just because the insurance market available for those products for motor courts, traditional SFD, there have not been an impact to the market at all. So the -- we -- it's critical that California has insurance, and we do think that the state is going to be carefully managing that to make sure that insurance is available. The thing that we still are very unique, we're -- our master plan communities through any number of incidents in Southern California have really proved the test of time that the design the fire hardening, the fire resistance that is built into these communities has worked. And so that realization, we are hopeful will help keep us moving forward. And as you said, there's a lot of devastation, there's a lot of lost homes. We're actually in the position that we could build additional deliver additional land in our master planned communities, which have all of the most recent thing around how do you build in California, which has a wildfire zone. Once again, there are -- there's numerous recent situations where all these new communities have held up extremely well. So right now, we think we'll be okay on the insurance side, although I do think that our product will stay to focus on individual insurance policies as opposed to large buildings. Alan Ratner Got it. That's helpful, Dan I appreciate that. Second, the growth opportunities here, I think, is obviously what everybody has been waiting for, for a long time and diversifying the asset base, but also kind of providing that road map for sustainability beyond Great Park -- that project all through. I know you mentioned kind of the infill opportunities, but I'd love to just drill on -- possible a little bit on San Francisco more so and to better understand the strategy there? It sounds like you guys are ready to start putting some shovels in the ground here in '24 unless I misinterpreted that. But I'm just trying to understand how you're thinking through the initial capital outlay that's going to be required before you start getting dollars back in. I think you kind of mentioned maybe some more asset-light strategies or joint venture partners. Is it possible at all to just put some dollars to all of this so we can better understand what the outflows might look like in the near term and then when the inflows do start, how that can flow through? Dan Hedigan Well, let me start off sure -- if I was clear right now, we are -- by the way, we are very, very happy with the support we got from the County of San Francisco, The City, The Mayor's office, they were very supportive in have getting us well positioned to start that project. So we actually had previously had the design for the first phase. And the first phase is infrastructure to give us flat pads. It ends up a large commercial site and then multiple residential sites for development. So when we think about that -- and now we also have flexibility. We have flexibility to go faster in commercial, slower and commercial, faster on housing. But our initial focus is engineering this year and then early next year, assuming we have all our permits, we'll start with that first phase of infrastructure. And we're going to be focusing completely on the horizontal and from a cash perspective, we're in a position to finance the horizontal development. But then we also have lots of opportunities on how to approach the vertical. And so we haven't decided what the best answer is there. We felt that it was really important to get the rebalancing done because we think that, that gives us the best value position on that asset. So at this point, just about it as we're going into construction in '26 -- the first phase will take at least 12 to 18 months to complete that first phase. So we'll be in the market sometime after that and seeing where that horizontal market is. We think there's a lot of opportunities up there. Operator Robert Heimowitz, Concise Capital. Robert Heimowitz Congrats on the results. I just wanted to ask about the notes. They're set to go to a 12% coupon at -- when they were originally set to mature on 11.15%. So I'm just wondering how you think about them with -- it feels like maybe some cash is leaking outside of the system with such an asset-heavy company, with so much cash? Like how do you think about addressing them? Like are you thinking of a refi or you just want to get the balance down first and then think about it? Kim Tobler Yes. Robert, good to talk to you. This is Kim. And first of all, it goes to 11% in November of this year and then 12% the following year, just to be clear. But with that said, we're actively looking at the possibility of a refinance. I can't (inaudible) that we'll be doing something like that, but we're watching the prices. The tenure has been not necessarily accommodating us. But I will tell you that given our financial position at this time, we think we're a better credit than the bonds reflect right now. And it would be my expectation to take advantage of that in the market, when it's appropriate to do so. And we're -- we'll discuss that with our Board and other advisers and make sure that we're doing the right thing. But either way, whether we do a refinance or not, we think it's prudent to pay down the notes even with the premium that they carry today perhaps. Robert Heimowitz Okay. Thanks for the correction. So just a quick follow-up on the new ventures. Is there any intention to put even, I don't know, even a small amount of capital into them as a way to show like alignment as a sponsor or -- or how are you thinking about these growth opportunities? Mike Alvarado This is Mike Alvarado. Yes, we would expect to have some equity investment in these ventures, probably not as large as what you see with the Great Park where we have a 37.5% percentage interest -- ownership interest -- but yes, we would expect to have some equity position in them. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Andrew (inaudible), a private investor. Myron Kaplan I guess my question goes back to demand, at Valencia. And we really haven't seen sales greater than 100 homes a quarter, and you appear to be selling lots, obviously, a lot quicker than that. Can you talk about like why you think the demand hasn't picked up? And also, have you guys seen any impact from (inaudible) Canyon at all? Dan Hedigan Andrew, thank you for the question. So on this question of absorption, one of the things that in a master planned community, six active programs is actually pretty small. And the -- I would tell you that one of the things we really need to do there is get some of the new programs open, because I think that gives a lot more product options to people. So I agree with you that you have -- we haven't seen a lot of sales, but we haven't had a lot of availability of programs either. And once again, the programs are -- you got to have a program right, for the buyers -- a whole diverse group of buyers that would be going up there. So we think that with the additional homes, our programs will be opening up this year. And you're right, we're putting -- we put lots out there ahead of time. But generally, it's taking about a year for a builder to close on land and to be in a position to enter the market with new product. So there's kind of the cycle that we really need to kind of get kick-started up there with a robust offering. So we're in the process of making that happen. And on your question on the landfill, we have not seen an impact. And I don't know that you have heard, but it's our understanding that the landfill has closed down as of December 31. Myron Kaplan Yes, that's what they have on their website. Okay. And so are you talking about buying back -- settling some of the debt and paying the 2% premium before November of this year? Kim Tobler Yes, Andrew, we're considering that. If it's -- again, if we can save money by paying down the debt and paying less for the year and total interest cost, we'll consider paying the [ 102 ]. Operator (Operator Instructions) Myron Kaplan, a private investor Myron Kaplan Nice -- well done, it's I could say you had phenominal year. Dan Hedigan Well, that's high praise from you, Myron. Myron Kaplan Well, I've been believing in you and so forth. I have a question, it's a little retro is -- what happened in the Hurst fire that was south of the new hall property or the Valencia property? (inaudible) a couple of weeks ago? Dan Hedigan Yes, it was a South and West of us. Myron Kaplan In the Hughes fire, this new Hughes fires to the Northeast? Dan Hedigan North and East. Yes. It was South and West and North and East. Myron Kaplan All right. So we talked about San Francisco, you're trying to expand Valencia, and again with the bonds because you're paying out a little over $50 million in insurance. So I guess -- I just add my vote to I hope that you'll be able to find a favorable refinance, especially since the company will be so will be relatively liquid and (inaudible) good credit by now by the end of the year, let's say, by the middle of the year. Dan Hedigan That's our expectation, Myron. We believe our credit profile has dramatically changed and that we can do better in the market. Right now, we need the market to understand these fire events because people are a little skittish about residential in California. But we think as it come to understand how the new communities are built and that this is actually something that needs to happen in the state to move forward. Myron Kaplan I mean, frankly, I'm surprised, I mean, I guess, or surprise and skeptical because it seems to me that the present -- the rate of sale of houses in LA County right now is probably heading towards zero, because people are, as you say, skittish and so forth, but I guess, hopefully, some kind of new order will emerge and they'll -- you'll be able to take advantage of it. Dan Hedigan I think we will, Myron. Myron Kaplan As far as San Francisco is concerned, I mean -- if you provide the infrastructure and you're doing the horizontal development, and somebody comes along, who wants to do the vertical, it seems to me that you ought to be able to (inaudible) a small equity interest without a capital contribution. Dan Hedigan Well, I'll tell you, we're looking at all those options. Myron Kaplan Okay. Well, all right. Well, you guys got some great moment. I think it's well done and impressive. Thank you. Operator There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to pass the call back over to Dan for any closing remarks. Dan Hedigan Thank you. On behalf of our management team, we thank you for joining us on today's call, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Operator This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Factors and Expansion in Emerging Markets Research and Markets Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 5:49 PM 8 min read Company Logo Anti-Snoring Treatment Market Anti-Snoring Treatment Market Dublin, Jan. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Anti-Snoring Treatment Market Report and Forecast 2024-2032\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The global anti-snoring treatment market attained a value of USD 1.35 billion in 2023. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 87.5% during the period 2024-2032, reaching USD 2.60 billion by 2032. This growth is driven by sedentary lifestyles, unhealthy dietary habits, increased alcohol consumption and smoking, rising healthcare expenditure, developing healthcare infrastructure, and the surge in the obese and ageing population. The global anti-snoring treatment market features key players such as Apnea Sciences Corporation, GlaxoSmithKline Plc, MEDiTAS Ltd, SomnoMed, Inc, The Pure Sleep Company, Resmed India Private Limited, Sleep Foundation (Sleep Doctor Holdings, LLC), Tomed Dr. Toussaint GmbH, Philips Healthcare Inc., Airway Management Inc., and Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited (FPH). These companies engage in various strategic activities such as mergers and acquisitions, product launches, research initiatives, and strategic partnerships to expand their market presence and capabilities. For instance, Philips Healthcare Inc. and Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited are renowned for their extensive portfolios of sleep and respiratory care products, including advanced CPAP machines. Other companies, such as SomnoMed, Inc. and Apnea Sciences Corporation, focus on the development and distribution of innovative oral appliances and nasal devices, driving growth and competition within the market. North America leads the market due to the high prevalence of sleep disorders, advanced healthcare infrastructure, and high awareness of the health risks associated with snoring. Europe follows closely, with a strong focus on innovative treatments and a growing demand for minimally invasive solutions. The Asia Pacific region is experiencing rapid growth due to increasing awareness about sleep disorders, rising healthcare investments, and the expanding middle class. Latin America, the Middle East and Africa are also expected to show substantial growth as healthcare infrastructure improves and awareness about sleep health increases. Market Drivers Increasing Awareness of Sleep Disorders: The growing recognition of sleep disorders, including snoring and sleep apnoea, is a significant driver for the anti-snoring treatment market. As awareness about the health risks associated with untreated snoring increases, more individuals are seeking effective treatment options. This heightened awareness is also driven by public health campaigns and educational initiatives, leading to a greater demand for anti-snoring devices and therapies. Rising Prevalence of Lifestyle-Related Factors: The increasing prevalence of lifestyle-related factors such as obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption is contributing to a higher incidence of snoring. These factors can exacerbate airway obstruction during sleep, making anti-snoring treatments more necessary. As these lifestyle issues become more common, the demand for effective snoring treatments continues to grow, driving market expansion. Technological Advancements in Treatment Devices: Continuous advancements in technology are leading to the development of more effective and user-friendly anti-snoring devices. Innovations such as adjustable mandibular advancement devices (MADs), improved CPAP machines, and minimally invasive surgical techniques are enhancing treatment outcomes and patient compliance. These technological improvements are driving the adoption of anti-snoring treatments across various patient demographics. Market Challenges High Cost of Treatment Devices and Surgeries: The high cost associated with anti-snoring devices and surgical treatments can be prohibitive for many individuals. Advanced devices such as CPAP machines and custom-fitted oral appliances can be expensive, limiting their accessibility to a broader population. Additionally, surgical procedures, though effective, often come with high costs, which can deter patients from pursuing these options. Low Awareness in Developing Regions: While awareness of snoring and its associated health risks is increasing in developed countries, it remains relatively low in many developing regions. This lack of awareness, coupled with limited access to healthcare services, poses a significant challenge to market growth in these areas. Addressing this challenge requires targeted awareness campaigns and improved access to affordable treatment options in these regions. Side Effects and Compliance Issues: Anti-snoring treatments, particularly devices like CPAP machines and oral appliances, can have side effects such as discomfort, dry mouth, or nasal congestion. These issues can lead to poor compliance among patients, reducing the effectiveness of the treatment. Ensuring that patients adhere to their treatment regimen is crucial for achieving desired outcomes, and addressing these side effects is a key challenge for manufacturers. Future Opportunities Expansion into Emerging Markets: The increasing focus on healthcare and rising disposable incomes in emerging markets offer substantial growth opportunities for the anti-snoring treatment market. As awareness about sleep disorders grows in regions such as Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa, the demand for effective treatments is expected to rise. Companies can capitalise on these opportunities by expanding their distribution networks and forming strategic partnerships in these regions. Development of Personalised Treatment Solutions: The trend towards personalised medicine is creating opportunities in the anti-snoring treatment market. Customised treatment solutions that are tailored to the individual needs of patients, such as custom-fitted oral appliances or tailored CPAP settings, are gaining popularity. These personalised approaches improve patient compliance and treatment outcomes, driving the market growth. Advancements in Non-Invasive Treatments: The development of non-invasive treatment options presents significant opportunities in the anti-snoring market. Non-invasive treatments such as EPAP devices, nasal dilators, and radiofrequency palatoplasty offer effective solutions with minimal discomfort and lower risks compared to surgical options. These treatments are increasingly preferred by patients seeking effective, yet less invasive, solutions. Global Anti-Snoring Treatment Market Trends Increasing Adoption of Home-Use Devices: There is a growing trend towards the adoption of home-use anti-snoring devices, driven by the convenience and privacy they offer. Devices such as CPAP machines, oral appliances, and nasal dilators are increasingly being designed for easy home use, allowing patients to manage their condition without frequent visits to healthcare providers. This trend is particularly strong in regions with advanced healthcare infrastructure, where patients prefer at-home treatments. Growing Focus on Minimally Invasive Surgeries: Minimally invasive surgical techniques are gaining traction in the anti-snoring treatment market. Procedures such as laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty and radiofrequency palatoplasty are becoming more popular due to their reduced recovery times, lower risks, and effectiveness in reducing snoring. This trend reflects a broader shift towards less invasive medical interventions across the healthcare industry. Integration of Smart Technology: The integration of smart technology in anti-snoring devices is an emerging trend. Smart devices that monitor sleep patterns and adjust treatment in real-time are becoming increasingly popular. These technologies enhance the effectiveness of anti-snoring treatments by providing personalised and adaptive solutions, thereby improving patient outcomes and compliance. Rising Demand for Portable and Travel-Friendly Devices: With the increasing prevalence of travel and mobile lifestyles, there is a growing demand for portable and travel-friendly anti-snoring devices. Compact and lightweight CPAP machines, portable nasal dilators, and foldable oral appliances are becoming more common, catering to the needs of frequent travellers and those with active lifestyles.
