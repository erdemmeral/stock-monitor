[{"text": "Jim Cramer Talks DuPont de Nemours (DD) and Its AI Semiconductor Spin-Off Plans \u2013 Here\u2019s Why Ramish Cheema Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 11:51 PM 5 min read In This Article: DD -0.94% We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses These 13 Stocks & Rejects The AI PC Super Cycle . In this article, we are going to take a look at where DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (NYSE:DD) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. In a fresh appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented in quite a bit of detail on artificial intelligence and AI PCs. AI, the technology that has caught the investing world by storm, has two facets. The first covers enterprise computing with cloud computing services such as Azure and AWS offering businesses new AI tools for their tasks. The second is the consumer end, dominated primarily via chatbots and services like the Chinese firm DeepSeek\u2019s R1 and OpenAI\u2019s o1. Another aspect of AI that received quite a lot of attention last year was AI PCs. These computers use hardware designed to run artificial intelligence workloads. This hardware includes graphics processing units (GPUs) and neural processing units (NPUs), which means that their price tag is often higher than a standard computer. On top of Cramer\u2019s mind was a recent Morgan Stanley consumer survey report which analyzed consumer sentiment with respect to a super-cycle in AI-enabled products. The bank revealed that just 15% of the 400 respondents bought some of the products primarily because they wanted to access AI. The bank added that 60% of respondents inadvertently bought an AI PC and more than 60% shared that they would not pay extra for AI products. Commenting on the research, Cramer started by sharing \u201cI think the AI hardware super cycle Morgan Stanley piece is perhaps the most damming piece I\u2019ve read.\u201d According to him, the research was striking \u201cBecause there\u2019s absolutely no evidence of a super cycle whatsoever.\u201d The CNBC host shifted towards enterprise AI use cases and was appreciative of them. \u201cI mean I think AI is very good when you listen to what Jamie Dimon [inaudible] to say, that AI is very good when you listen to what Marc Benioff has to say,\u201d he outlined. However, while AI has impressed business users, Cramer admitted to being wrong about consumer demand for AI PCs. \u201cBut the PC, I thought we were all gonna upgrade. And now we\u2019re all in wait-and-see mode,\u201d he shared. Cramer added that those he knew who have bought an AI PC \u201chaven\u2019t used it or there\u2019s a button there and it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Yet, even though consumer interest in AI PCs might be lackluster, Cramer is still an AI believer. He revealed that \u201cI use it [ChatGPT] every day.\u201d One ChatGPT use case he likes is comparing drugs. \u201cAnd you start at ChatGPT. You really do. And it\u2019s very authoritative and it tells you who to go to. And I think it\u2019s extraordinary. It\u2019s an extraordinarily good product,\u201d according to Cramer. Story Continues In fact, Cramer\u2019s \u201con ChatGPT maybe five times before I come down here. Ten times before I do Mad Money. There\u2019s nothing I don\u2019t run through. Because I don\u2019t want to make a mistake.\u201d However, he did add that while ChatGPT is great, this doesn\u2019t mean \u201cthat it\u2019s not hallucinating.\u201d Yet, Cramer still suggests \u201c. . anyone use it before they buy a stock. It\u2019s that good.\u201d His praise for ChatGPT isn\u2019t the first time that Cramer\u2019s shared opinions on AI. In a recent CNBC morning appearance , he outlined some enterprise AI use cases. Cramer shared: \u201cHealthcare\u2019s gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it\u2019s not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there\u2019s a call center that\u2019s better.\u201d Our Methodology To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 23rd.

Jim Cramer Talks DuPont de Nemours (DD) and Its AI Semiconductor Spin-Off Plans - Here's Why A closeup of a hand manipulating a complex piece of machinery in a semiconductor factory. DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (NYSE: DD ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 47 DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (NYSE:DD) is one of the largest chemical companies in the world. The firm\u2019s stock remained flat in 2024 as it struggled with a broader industrial slowdown in the US and China. However, the shares didn\u2019t close 2024 lower as DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (NYSE:DD) benefited from robust demand in the semiconductor industry due to AI. Its stock jumped by 6% in November after the Q3 report revealed a 13.4% jump in the electronics and business division. DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (NYSE:DD) is set to split into two firms, and Cramer commented on its earnings and the spin-off as he compared the firm to ailing industrial stock Honeywell: \u201cDuPont did not miss the quarter. It\u2019s still not up. They were going to split into three, now they\u2019re splitting into two, electric and chemicals and water.\u201d Overall, DD ranks 13st on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of DD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock .

Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report? Zacks Equity Research Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 8:10 PM 3 min read In This Article: DD -0.94% Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? DuPont de Nemours (DD), which belongs to the Zacks Chemical - Diversified industry, could be a great candidate to consider. When looking at the last two reports, this specialty chemicals maker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 13.79%, on average, in the last two quarters. For the last reported quarter, DuPont de Nemours came out with earnings of $1.18 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.04 per share, representing a surprise of 13.46%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.85 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.97 per share, delivering a surprise of 14.12%. Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for DuPont de Nemours lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank. Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. DuPont de Nemours currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.06%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on February 11, 2025. With the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss. Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate. Story Continues Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
