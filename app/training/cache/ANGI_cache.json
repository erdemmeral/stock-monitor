This targeted approach allows insurers to optimize their marketing budgets and improve customer acquisition efficiency, positioning MediaAlpha as a leader in its field. Moreover, the digital advertising space, particularly in the insurance sector, is witnessing rapid growth. As more insurance providers shift their marketing efforts online, MediaAlpha\u2019s technology-driven solutions are uniquely suited to meet their needs.

Transaction value in the quarter was even more impressive, surging 314% to $451.8 million. A significant highlight was the Property & Casualty insurance vertical, which saw transaction value rise by an extraordinary 766% to $387 million. This performance speaks to the company\u2019s ability to leverage market trends and its technology-driven platform effectively.

be one of the most challenging periods in your life. In fact, 38% say moving is more stressful than a breakup, according to a Move.org survey . Not only are you leaving behind the memories of one place and trying to find a new place that feels right, but there\u2019s also the financial cost of hiring movers. If you\u2019re not careful, you could end up overspending, making the whole endeavor even more stressful. Learn More: 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000 Find Out: 7 Frugal Habits of the \u2018Shark Tank\u2019 Stars Data from Angi shows that moving costs vary significantly, ranging from $884 to $2,569, while averaging $1,713 nationally. Ending up toward the low end of the range can make a meaningful difference on your finances, compared to the high end. To help you avoid spending too much on a moving company, watch out for the following signs. And while you\u2019re planning a move, make you be mindful of these money mistakes. You\u2019re Quoted a Generic Rate There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with choosing a flat rate moving company \u2014 many people prefer that, and you might save money versus an hourly rate. However, that flat rate should still be adapted to your situation. If the moving company only offers you one rate without asking questions like about your home size and bulky items, and it turns out you\u2019re a minimalist, then you might be overpaying. \u201cMoving costs vary depending on the size of your home, your location and the specific moving services you select,\u201d noted Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi. So, she suggests looking at estimates on how much moving will cost based on the factors relevant to you. That way, you can get a better sense of how the quote stacks up.

But related to not wanting a generic quote, you should let moving companies see your setup so they can accurately quote you. Maybe you live in a 2-bedroom but are leaving most of your furniture behind, so you only have as many boxes as the average 1-bedroom. If movers can see exactly what you\u2019re taking with you, they might be able to give you a better price. \u201cOnce you have a ballpark range in mind, get in-person estimates from a few different moving companies in your area. I always recommend getting multiple quotes before settling on a moving company, just to make sure you\u2019re paying a fair price,\u201d said Hicks. Story Continues They\u2019re Tacking on Fees We\u2019ve all seen deals that look great at first, but when you add miscellaneous fees, suddenly that bargain turns into a rip-off. The same can happen with movers. Ideally you\u2019ll be aware of these additional fees beforehand, like insurance costs or extra mileage fees past a certain amount, even if moving within the same city. But do the math, and if you see that these fees are adding up, perhaps a company with a higher base rate but lack of additional fees ends up being less expensive. They Charge Hourly, and Reviews Say They\u2019re Slow For some moves, hourly rates end up being less expensive than flat rates, such as if you have less stuff than the average person, or you don\u2019t have many heavy items that take a while to get in and out. However, be sure to read reviews of different moving companies. You might find that movers quote a low hourly rate , and maybe they give you the option to pay for three movers instead of two for a higher hourly rate, with the idea being that more movers leads to a faster job, thereby saving you money. But if reviews say they\u2019re very slow, and maybe intentionally milking the clock, then maybe you\u2019re better off paying the lower rate for two movers instead of three, or just going with a company that has a higher base rate but better reviews. Don\u2019t Forget To Balance Cost With Quality Speaking of reviews, be sure to do your homework to make sure you\u2019re choosing a reputable company. The cheapest option isn\u2019t always the best choice, such as if it leads to broken items that end up costing you more to replace. Or, an unscrupulous company might pull tactics like holding your items hostage if you don\u2019t pay more.\u00a0If you\u2019re following the terms of the contract, then this could be illegal, but sometimes people just want to get the nightmare over with and pay up. To avoid this, and make sure you\u2019re satisfied with the move, consider if paying a little more for higher-rated movers makes sense. \u201cSacrificing quality is never a good idea. Your moving company will be responsible for keeping your items safe during transit, so it\u2019s important to choose a trustworthy, reliable company,\u201d said Hicks. \u201cIf you\u2019re on a budget

news and updates on Trump's tariffs 10 Things Frugal Retirees Never Waste Money On Angela Mae Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 3:00 PM 6 min read vorDa / iStock.com Many Americans live on a fixed income when they retire , which can mean a tighter wallet. Considering the average retired worker earns an estimated $1,976 a month from Social Security in 2025, many retirees have to live frugally to make ends meet. Be Aware: The New Retirement Problem Boomers Are Facing Check Out: 4 Unusual Ways To Make Extra Money That Actually Work According to a report from the Social Security Administration (SSA), approximately half of Americans aged 65 and older rely on Social Security benefits for half of their total monthly income. Another quarter relies on those benefits to make up a staggering 90% of their monthly income. Even those who have other sources of income might still strive to keep costs low by cutting out unnecessary or expensive purchases and hobbies. But being frugal doesn\u2019t mean you have to make sacrifices as much as it means making savvy financial choices . If you\u2019re retiring on a tight budget, consider avoiding these 10 things that frugal retirees don\u2019t waste money on . Boats There may be no more of a cliche retirement purchase than buying a boat once you leave the workforce. Something about heading to sea has its lure and luster, but the hidden costs that come with such a big purchase will make it hard to keep your finances afloat. Buying a boat for $90,000 and only using it once a month is quite a big expense to swallow if you are living off of Social Security. Resort Living Yes, resort living is a luxury, but it may also be a financial money pit from which you cannot escape. Fine dining, housekeeping, valet and concierge services are all lovely amenities, but not necessities when it comes to sticking to a budget. It\u2019s best to keep these stays for vacations rather than living accommodations to avoid both high costs and a bit of redundancy. Read Next: Cutting Expenses for Retirement? Here\u2019s the No. 1 Thing To Get Rid of First Dream House Buying your dream home may seem like the perfect retirement plan, but living beneath your means will help you stretch your benefits much further. Instead of building an expensive house where you can incur unexpected contracting costs or property taxes, staying in a home you\u2019ve already paid off paints a prettier financial picture. Excessive Dining Out In the U.S., the average cost of a single meal at an inexpensive restaurant is reportedly about $20. A meal at a mid-range restaurant can cost about $35 to $40 per person. While even frugal retirees still go out to eat on occasion, they\u2019re more likely to cut back on dining out and stick to planning and cooking meals at home. Not only can they save money this way, but they also get more control over what \u2014 and how much \u2014 they eat. Story Continues To put this into further context, data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the average American consumer (all ages) spent about $9,985 on food in 2023. This includes $6,053 on food at home ($504 monthly) and $3,933 on food away from home ($328 monthly). While frugal retirees will still have to make up for some of the \u201cfood away from home\u201d expenses with their grocery bill, eating at home can cut costs down substantially. Costly Hobbies Some hobbies are much more expensive than others. For example, GOGO Charters estimates that the average cost of a one-week U.S. vacation is $1,984 per person. Overseas trips can be much more expensive, especially if there aren\u2019t any direct or budget-friendly flights available. It\u2019s not just travel, though. Many frugal retirees will also avoid hobbies and interests that come with ongoing or excessive costs. Whether that\u2019s skiing or photography, if the money required is on the higher side, they\u2019ll often stick with cheaper options. Or they\u2019ll find ways to keep costs low, such as by borrowing equipment or using what they already have. Impulsive Online Purchases A Capital One Shopping survey found that the average American consumer spends roughly $282 a month on impulse buys. That\u2019s about $3,384 a year. For retirees who are trying to keep to a tight budget, this is simply too much. Of course, that\u2019s not to say that frugal retirees are totally immune to impulse purchases. It\u2019s also not necessarily a bad thing to treat yourself every now and then. The problem comes from making frequent impulsive purchases . Even if each one seems relatively small, they can quickly add up to hundreds or even thousands of dollars. High-End or Designer Clothes Dressing well or replacing tattered old clothes that no longer fit is one thing. Spending a ton on designer apparel is another. For many frugal-minded individuals, including retirees, this is one area that\u2019s generally avoided. After all, spending $500 or more on a Versace T-shirt isn\u2019t very feasible when income is limited or when you\u2019re trying to ensure you\u2019re leaving behind a substantial inheritance for your loved ones. Many retirees will stick with more affordable brands, including non-name-brand options, to save money. Home Upgrades Fannie Mae reported that roughly 80% of Americans aged 60 and up own their home. But that doesn\u2019t mean those same Americans want to spend a ton on maintenance, repairs and upgrades. Homeownership already comes with a whole host of other costs, including property taxes and insurance. According to Angi, the average cost of renovating a home last year fell somewhere between $19,526 and $87,972. That\u2019s a hefty chunk of change for anyone, but especially frugal retirees. If a renovation can be avoided, chances are it will be. High-End Electronics There\u2019s no real reason to discard old electronics when they already work perfectly well, especially for frugal retirees. Whether it\u2019s a computer monitor, speakers or a television, if it\u2019s getting on just fine, they\u2019re more likely to stick with it until it\u2019s not. Electronics can easily run hundreds or thousands of dollars. Even a simple computer monitor starts at around $100. Higher-end models can be much more expensive than that. Smart TVs are also on the pricey side. At Best Buy, for example, you can find them for anywhere from $1,000 to over $3,000. Unless it\u2019s seriously time for an upgrade, it\u2019s often simply not worth the cost. New Vehicles or Fancy Cars Like many other adults, retirees often need a vehicle to get around. But that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re spending tens of thousands of dollars on a new car every few years. AutoInsurance.com reports that, on average, the majority of people stop driving at 85. If you retire at 70, you\u2019ll still have about 15 more years of driving left. While it might make financial \u2014 and practical \u2014 sense to get a new (or lightly used) vehicle in your 50s or 60s after retiring, it\u2019s generally better for your wallet if you stick with the current model. The exception, of course, is if it no longer runs or has major safety issues. Caitlyn Moorhead contributed to the reporting for this article.
