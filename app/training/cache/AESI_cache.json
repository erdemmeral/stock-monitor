(NYSE: AESI ) shares are trading higher on Monday. The company inked a deal to acquire Moser Energy Systems for $220 million . The transaction comprises $180 million in cash and approximately 1.7 million shares of Atlas\u2019 common stock, valued at $40 million based on the 20-day trailing volume-weighted average price as of January 24, 2025. Atlas may opt to pay the entire consideration in cash instead of issuing stock. The final mix of cash and stock will be determined at closing, with stock consideration subject to customary adjustments. If the cash option is not exercised, Atlas retains the right to redeem all or part of the issued shares for cash post-closing. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2025. The merger of Atlas\u2019s completion platform and Moser\u2019s distributed power solutions is expected to create a diversified energy provider with a strong portfolio in proppant, logistics (including Dune Express), and distributed power. Also, Moser\u2019s fleet of natural gas-powered assets (~212MWs) expands Atlas\u2019s reach into production and distributed power markets, benefiting from strong macro trends that mitigate volatility in completions operations. Moreover, Atlas\u2019s customer base will expand, particularly in the Permian Basin, while gaining access to other key U.S. basins. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive, with an estimated $40 million-$45 million in adjusted EBITDA for 2025. The acquisition implies a valuation of 4.3X 2025 adjusted EBITDA on a full run-rate basis. Preliminary Results: For the fourth quarter, Atlas expects revenue of $270.0 million-$272.0 million (vs. consensus of $276.7 million), up 92% year-over-year at the midpoint and adjusted EBITDA of $62.2 million-$64.2 million, a decrease of about 8% Y/Y at the midpoint. For 2024, the company expects revenue of $1.055 billion-$1.057 billion (vs. consensus of $1.062 billion), up 72% Y/Y at the midpoint and adjusted EBITDA of $287.9 million-$289.9 million, down approximately 12% Y/Y at the midpoint. The company sees cash and cash equivalents of about $71.7 million at the end of the fourth quarter. As of the third quarter-end, the company had $78.6 million in cash and equivalents . Atlas expects to release fourth-quarter results on Monday, February 24, 2025 . Investors can gain exposure to the stock via FT Vest SMID Rising Dividend Achievers Target Income ETF (BATS: SDVD ).

Announces Agreement to Acquire Moser Energy Systems and Provides Preliminary Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2024 Results Business Wire Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 2:00 PM 19 min read In This Article: AESI -3.05% AUSTIN, Texas, January 27, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Atlas Energy Solutions Inc. (NYSE: AESI) (\"Atlas\" or the \"Company\") today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of Moser Acquisition, Inc. (\"Moser Energy Systems\" or \"Moser\"), a leading provider of distributed power solutions, in a transaction valued at $220 million (the \"Moser Acquisition\"). The transaction consideration includes $180 million of cash and approximately 1.7 million shares (the \"Stock Consideration\") of the Company\u2019s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, which are valued at $40.0 million based on the 20-day trailing volume-weighted average price ending at the close of trading on Friday, January 24, 2025. Atlas has the ability to elect to pay the aggregate transaction consideration in cash in lieu of Atlas\u2019s issuance of the Stock Consideration (the \"Cash Option\"). The final consideration mix will be determined at closing and the Stock Consideration is subject to revision for customary post-closing adjustments. Following closing, if the Cash Option has not been exercised, all or any portion of the Stock Consideration will be subject to redemption at the option of Atlas, with any such redemption to be paid in cash. Acquisition Highlights The combination of Atlas\u2019s completion platform and Moser\u2019s distributed power platform creates an innovative, diversified energy solutions provider with a leading portfolio of proppant, logistics (including the Dune Express) and distributed power solutions. Dynamic fleet of natural gas-powered assets (~212MWs) expands Atlas\u2019s current operations into production and distributed power end markets supported by strong macro tailwinds expected to reduce through-cycle volatility associated with completions operations. Moser\u2019s strong EBITDA (1) margin profile of 50%+ and robust cash flow generation is expected to enhance Atlas\u2019s pro forma cash flow generation and shareholder returns. Adds critical, differentiated in-house manufacturing and remanufacturing capabilities driving best-in-class quality and reliability while reducing through-cycle maintenance and equipment replacement costs. Increases Atlas\u2019s customer reach with a vital power service offering in Atlas\u2019s core geography, the Permian Basin, while providing geographic diversity with operating locations in key oil and gas basins across the central United States. Estimated to be immediately accretive. Assuming 10-months of contribution, we expect the acquired assets to generate $40-45 million in Adjusted EBITDA (1) in 2025, which implies on a full run-rate basis a valuation of approximately 4.3x 2025 Adjusted EBITDA (1) . The transaction is expected to close before the end of the first quarter of 2025. Story Continues John Turner, President and Chief Executive Officer of Atlas, commented, \"Today marks yet another exciting milestone for Atlas. This acquisition diversifies the Company into attractive high-growth end markets in both production and distributed power while strengthening Atlas\u2019s current market position as a leading provider of energy solutions within the oil and gas sector across North America. This transaction highlights our continued commitment to evolve our organization by deploying innovative and differentiated solutions to return value to our shareholders. We are looking forward to continuing to invest in our current operations and expand the capabilities of our distributed power platform.\" \"When we made our original investment in Moser, we saw a company with tremendous potential and a rich legacy of customer service and excellence that Randy Moser and his family had built over the previous 40 years. We have worked hard to be good caretakers of that legacy as we have grown the business, and we view Atlas Energy as the perfect company to further build upon that legacy,\" said Mark Plunkett, Managing Partner of Hilltop Opportunity Partners. \"We have greatly valued the partnership we have had with the Moser team over the last several years and look forward to watching them thrive as they lead Moser into this next chapter with Atlas.\" Transaction Financing At closing, Atlas will fund $180 million of cash and 1.7 million shares of Atlas common stock, subject to the Cash Option, to Moser\u2019s sole shareholder. Atlas has secured funding for the cash portion of the consideration, including the Cash Option, if exercised, through an upsizing amendment to its existing delayed draw term loan facility. Transaction Timing and Approvals Atlas\u2019s Board of Directors has approved the Moser Acquisition. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and the Company expects the transaction to close by the end of the first quarter of 2025.

About Atlas Energy Solutions Atlas Energy Solutions Inc. is a leading proppant producer and proppant logistics provider, serving primarily the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. We operate 14 proppant production facilities across the Permian Basin with a combined annual production capacity of 29 million tons, including both large-scale in-basin facilities and smaller distributed mining units. We manage a portfolio of leading-edge logistics assets, which includes our 42-mile Dune Express conveyor system. In addition to our conveyor infrastructure, we manage a fleet of over 120 trucks, which are capable of delivering expanded payloads due to our custom-manufactured trailers and patented drop-depot process. Our approach to managing both our proppant production and proppant logistics operations is intently focused on leveraging technology, automation and remote operations to drive efficiencies. We are a low-cost producer of various high-quality, locally sourced proppants used during the well completion process. We offer both dry and damp sand, and carry various mesh sizes including 100 mesh and 40/70 mesh. Proppant is a key component necessary to facilitate the recovery of hydrocarbons from oil and natural gas wells. Our logistics platform is designed to increase the efficiency, safety and sustainability of the oil and natural gas industry within the Permian Basin. Proppant logistics is increasingly a differentiating factor affecting customer choice among proppant producers. The cost of delivering sand, even short distances, can be a significant component of customer spending on their well completions given the substantial volumes that are utilized in modern well designs. We continue to invest in and pursue leading-edge technologies, including autonomous trucking, digital infrastructure, and artificial intelligence, to support opportunities to gain efficiencies in our operations. These technology-focused investments aim to improve our cost structure and also combine to produce beneficial environmental and community impacts. While our core business is fundamentally aligned with a lower emissions economy, our core obligation has been, and will always be, to our stockholders. We recognize that maximizing value for our stockholders requires that we optimize the outcomes for our broader stakeholders, including our employees and the communities in which we operate. We are proud of the fact that our approach to innovation in the hydrocarbon industry while operating in an environmentally responsible manner creates immense value. Since our founding in 2017, our core mission has been to improve human beings\u2019 access to the hydrocarbons that power our lives while also delivering differentiated social and environmental progress. Our Atlas team has driven innovation and has produced industry-leading environmental benefits by reducing energy consumption, emissions, and our aerial footprint. We call this Sustainable Environmental and Social Progress. We were founded in 2017 by Ben M. \"Bud\" Brigham, our Executive Chairman, and are led by an entrepreneurial team with a history of constructive disruption bringing significant and complementary experience to this enterprise, including the perspective of longtime E&P operators, which provides for an elevated understanding of the end users of our products and services. Our executive management team has a proven track record with a history of generating positive returns and value creation. Our experience as E&P operators was instrumental to our understanding of the opportunity created by in-basin sand production and supply in the Permian Basin, which we view as North America\u2019s premier shale resource and which we believe will remain its most active through economic cycles.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release includes or references certain forward-looking financial measures not prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Because Atlas provides certain of these measures on a forward-looking basis, it cannot reliably or reasonably predict certain of the necessary components of the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures, such as Gross Profit, Net Income, Operating Income, or any other measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, Atlas is unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of such forward-looking, non-GAAP financial measures to the respective most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures. Atlas believes that these forward-looking, non-GAAP measures may be a useful tool for the investment community in comparing Atlas\u2019s forecasted financial performance to the forecasted financial performance of other companies in the industry.

Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows management to more effectively evaluate the Company\u2019s operating performance and compare the results of its operations from period to period and against our peers without regard to financing method or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above from net income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. We define EBITDA as net income before depreciation, depletion and accretion expense, amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, interest expense, and income tax expense.

Semi-Truck Service Business Wire Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 4:00 PM 10 min read In This Article: AESI -3.05% Atlas Energy Solutions delivers 100 loads of proppant as the first semi-truck customer to make driverless deliveries with its own RoboTruck fleet Atlas Energy Solutions concurrently launched the Dune Express, a 42-mile autonomous conveyor system that delivers sand to Atlas\u2019s autonomous RoboTrucks and is a meaningful part of Atlas\u2019s strategy to automate its entire supply chain AUSTIN, Texas & MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., January 24, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Kodiak Robotics, Inc. , a leading autonomous truck developer, and Atlas Energy Solutions Inc. (NYSE: AESI) (\"Atlas\") today announced that Atlas has completed the delivery of 100 loads of proppant with its two RoboTrucks, semi-trucks equipped with the Kodiak Driver, Kodiak\u2019s self-driving system. This milestone marks the first time ever that a customer has taken ownership of a RoboTruck and launched driverless commercial semi-trucking operations. The initial driverless operations, which were announced in July 2024, involved Kodiak delivering Atlas\u2019s frac sand along a 21-mile off-road route in West Texas\u2019s Permian Basin with Kodiak-owned driverless trucks. With Kodiak providing the self-driving technology for these initial Atlas-owned RoboTrucks, Atlas is now able to complete its own driverless deliveries across the 75,000 square mile Permian Basin in West Texas and Eastern New Mexico. This sets Kodiak apart as the first company in the autonomous trucking industry to launch commercial driverless trucking operations. \"This is an incredible moment, for us and for the autonomous trucking industry as we have officially delivered a commercial RoboTruck to a customer and launched commercial operations,\" said Don Burnette, Founder and CEO, Kodiak. \"The commercialization of autonomous trucks has been a goal for the industry for many years, and it has now come to fruition. Kodiak is the first company to make autonomous trucking a real business, and this is a major step towards profitability for our company.\" Atlas intends to scale its RoboTruck deployment considerably over the course of 2025 with multiple RoboTruck deployments expected throughout the year. Given the scale and scope of operations in the Permian Basin, Kodiak announced that it has established an office in Odessa, Texas to support Atlas\u2019s operations. The 18,000-square-foot facility houses a team of 12 Kodiak employees, and is projected to grow to approximately 20 people by the end of Q1 2025. Kodiak\u2019s launch of driverless trucking service coincides with Atlas\u2019s first deliveries of sand off of the Dune Express, a 42-mile long, fully-electric conveyor system that carries sand from Atlas\u2019s Kermit, Texas sand facility to an end-of-line loadout facility in eastern New Mexico. Atlas\u2019s Kodiak-driver equipped, autonomous RoboTrucks are expected to move sand from the Dune Express to Atlas\u2019s customers across the Delaware Basin. The Dune Express is part of Atlas\u2019s strategy to automate the entire logistics process for sand delivery to make it safer, more efficient, and more reliable. It also aims to eliminate millions of truck miles driven on public roads across the Permian, reducing traffic and improving safety. Story Continues \"Incorporating these driverless RoboTrucks into our operations is a significant advancement in the automation of our business, enhancing our ability to maintain a fundamentally safe and reliable service at the best price for our customers,\" said John Turner, CEO, Atlas. \"Becoming the first company to operate our own autonomous semi-trucks and reaching 100 successful autonomous proppant deliveries demonstrates our unique commitment to driving innovation and automation across the Permian Basin\u2019s rugged terrain, dust, and heat.\" Prior to launching driverless operations with Atlas, Kodiak successfully completed its safety case, which is a comprehensive evaluation that demonstrates the safety and readiness of its self-driving system, within Atlas\u2019s operating domain. The delivery of the world\u2019s first customer-owned driverless RoboTrucks for industrial operations happened in December 2024, and driverless service with these trucks commenced on December 18 th , 2024. This is the first stage in Kodiak\u2019s commercialization roadmap. As a next step, Kodiak will extend its safety case to highways for its long-haul customers. The Kodiak Driver-equipped RoboTrucks feature Kodiak\u2019s sixth generation platform, which includes all the redundant components required for operations without a safety driver. This includes Kodiak\u2019s proprietary SensorPods\u2122 , pre-calibrated modular units that house all the sensors needed for autonomous driving, enabling fast and easy repairs.

About Atlas Energy Solutions Atlas Energy Solutions Inc. is a leading proppant producer and proppant logistics provider, serving primarily the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. We operate 14 proppant production facilities across the Permian Basin with a combined annual production capacity of 29 million tons, including both large-scale in-basin facilities and smaller distributed mining units. We manage a portfolio of leading-edge logistics assets, which includes our 42-mile Dune Express conveyor system. In addition to our conveyor infrastructure, we manage a fleet of 120 trucks, which are capable of delivering expanded payloads due to our custom-manufactured trailers and patented drop-depot process. Our approach to managing both our proppant production and proppant logistics operations is intently focused on leveraging technology, automation and remote operations to drive efficiencies. We are a low-cost producer of various high-quality, locally sourced proppants used during the well completion process. We offer both dry and damp sand, and carry various mesh sizes including 100 mesh and 40/70 mesh. Proppant is a key component necessary to facilitate the recovery of hydrocarbons from oil and natural gas wells. Our logistics platform is designed to increase the efficiency, safety and sustainability of the oil and natural gas industry within the Permian Basin. Proppant logistics is increasingly a differentiating factor affecting customer choice among proppant producers. The cost of delivering sand, even short distances, can be a significant component of customer spending on their well completions given the substantial volumes that are utilized in modern well designs. We continue to invest in and pursue leading-edge technologies, including autonomous trucking, digital infrastructure, and artificial intelligence, to support opportunities to gain efficiencies in our operations. To this end, we have recently taken delivery of next-generation dredge mining assets to drive efficiencies in our proppant production operations. These technology-focused investments aim to improve our cost structure and also combine to produce beneficial environmental and community impacts. While our core business is fundamentally aligned with a lower emissions economy, our core obligation has been, and will always be, to our stockholders. We recognize that maximizing value for our stockholders requires that we optimize the outcomes for our broader stakeholders, including our employees and the communities in which we operate. We are proud of the fact that our approach to innovation in the hydrocarbon industry while operating in an environmentally responsible manner creates immense value. Since our founding in 2017, our core mission has been to improve human beings\u2019 access to the hydrocarbons that power our lives while also delivering differentiated social and environmental progress. Our Atlas team has driven innovation and has produced industry-leading environmental benefits by reducing energy consumption, emissions, and our aerial footprint. We call this Sustainable Environmental and Social Progress. We were founded in 2017 by Ben M. \"Bud\" Brigham, our Executive Chairman, and are led by an entrepreneurial team with a history of constructive disruption bringing significant and complementary experience to this enterprise, including the perspective of longtime E&P operators, which provides for an elevated understanding of the end users of our products and services. Our executive management team has a proven track record with a history of generating positive returns and value creation. Our experience as E&P operators was instrumental to our understanding of the opportunity created by in-basin sand production and supply in the Permian Basin, which we view as North America\u2019s premier shale resource and which we believe will remain its most active through economic cycles.
