Financial Milestones Kids Should Reach at Every Age Gabrielle Olya Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 8:08 PM 5 min read Liderina / Shutterstock.com Although talking about money can be uncomfortable, parents should start teaching kids about finances from an early age. Yet according to a Chase study, 30% of parents in the U.S. are not regularly discussing financial topics with their children. Find Out: How Much Money Do Americans Have in Their Bank Accounts in 2025? For You: 4 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money \u201cLearning good financial habits early will help prepare kids for what\u2019s to come,\u201d said Matt Gromada, managing director and head of youth, family and starter banking at Chase. Guiding your kids through various financial milestones offers teachable moments and learning opportunities along the way. Here\u2019s a look at the financial milestones your kids should be reaching and when . insta_photos / iStock.com Open Their First Bank Account: Any Age \u201cIt\u2019s never too early to have a bank account, and one of the easiest ways parents can teach their kids about money is opening a bank account for them,\u201d Gromada said. \u201cHaving a bank account has benefits for both parents and kids \u2014 first, it opens the door for important conversations about the basics of money with real-life examples, from spending and saving to explaining interest and how it accrues. Second, it gives a child a sense of responsibility and independence, which provides the opportunity for them to take action on how to spend and save.\u201d Gromada recommends choosing an account that lets parents monitor and manage their kid\u2019s spending and saving. \u201cFor example, Chase First Banking is an option for kids ages 6 and older, and comes with their very own debit card that is managed by kids and parents entirely through the Chase Mobile app,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the child ages, they can graduate into High School and College Checking accounts. Getting started with a bank account early will help ensure kids are on the right path to financial success.\u201d Consider This: 3 Signs You\u2019ve \u2018Made It\u2019 Financially, According to Financial Influencer Genesis Hinckley Read Next: I\u2019m a Financial Advisor: 10 Most Awesome Things You Can Do for Your Finances in 2025 Africa Studio / Shutterstock.com Earn an Allowance: Age 5 or 6 Scholastic recommends allowing your child to start earning an allowance at age 5 or 6. \u201cStart offering an allowance when your child is ready to learn how to save and how to spend their money mindfully. And starting simple is key,\u201d Gromada said. \u201cParents can start with a small amount per week or month, and raise it as a child ages and/or begins to take on additional responsibilities.\u201d Giving your children an allowance is an opportunity to teach them about saving. \u201cIdentify something they\u2019d like to save for and have them set aside a certain amount of their allowance each month to save up for the purchase,\u201d Gromada said. \u201cWhether or not you choose to pay your kid for chores they complete is entirely up to you \u2014 the important thing is that earning money helps start important conversations about money.\u201d Story Continues Trending Now: 8 Must-Read Personal Finance Books of 2024 for a Fresh Start in 2025 PixelsEffect / Getty Images Be a Part of Family Budget Planning: Age 8 When your kid is old enough to understand addition and subtraction, they should be old enough to understand the concept of money coming in and money going out, which usually happens around age 8, according to Parents. \u201cWhen parents bring their kids into conversations about how to budget, save and spend mindfully, it helps build a strong financial foundation,\u201d Gromada said. \u201cUsing real-life experiences as teachable moments can help kids understand the difference between the things they want and the things they need. \u201cFor example, show them how to plan for food and other household expenses \u2014 things they need \u2014 or help them create their own budget to ensure they can afford things they want, such as a summer entertainment expense,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis will help build financial skills to show how to balance saving versus spending on needs versus wants, and show that money doesn\u2019t have to be a taboo topic.\u201d ChameleonsEye / Shutterstock.com Get a Summer Job: Age 14 By the teenage years, a weekly allowance may not cover all the things your kid wants to buy, so it\u2019s a good time to encourage your child to get a summer job, according to Parents. \u201cKids and tweens eager to earn money outside of household opportunities, like chores, babysitting or yardwork, may be ready to start their first job,\u201d Gromada said. \u201cStarting their first job is a huge milestone and a perfect opportunity for parents to dive deeper into financial topics with their teens. For example, it\u2019s a great time to discuss smart spending strategies, since they likely already have their next purchase in mind before receiving their first paycheck.\u201d Gromada recommends discussing the purchases they want to make. \u201cWhen they do make a purchase, remind them to look at their bank account first to see how it will impact their money overall,\u201d he said. \u201cTeens will be better prepared for future financial independence \u2014 and many more expenses \u2014 if they learn how to spend thoughtfully.\u201d kali9 / Getty Images Open Their First Credit Card: Age 16 to 18 Although they typically need to be 18 to have their own credit card, you can add your child as an authorized user before this age. Some financial experts recommend giving your child access to a credit card in their late teens so they can start to build credit, as well as learn how credit works. \u201cThe decision to provide a child with their own card or add them as a user on their parents\u2019 card depends on the family,\u201d Gromada said. \u201cBefore handing the card over, though, help them understand the basics of credit, the impact of debt, and best practices for spending and making payments on time. This will help them establish a credit history and start building a strong credit score from early on, which can have a positive impact on their future financial decisions, like purchasing their first car or renting an apartment.\u201d More From GOBankingRates 4 Low-Risk Ways To Build Your Savings in 2025 5 2025 SUVs the Middle Class Should Consider Buying 25 Places To Buy a Home If You Want It To

heating plant for \u0160KO-ENERGO, s.r.o. in the Czech Republic PR Newswire Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 12:10 PM 3 min read In This Article: VLMTY VOYJF Valmet Oyj press release, January 22, 2025 , at 11:00 a.m. EET ESPOO,\u00a0Finland , Jan. 22, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Valmet is to supply the modernization of \u0160KO-ENERGO's heating plant in Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav, Czech Republic . The project includes converting the two existing circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boilers from coal to biomass and delivering a new bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) boiler. The order also includes a flue gas cleaning system for the new boiler and modifications to the flue gas cleaning systems of the upgraded boilers. The order is included in Valmet's orders received of the fourth quarter 2024. The value of the order will not be disclosed. In addition to converting two existing CFB boilers from coal to 100 percent biomass, a new BFB boiler will be delivered to compensate for the reduced capacity from the converted CFB boilers. The new boiler will work alongside the retrofitted ones, which will handle a biomass mix of wood chips and agro-biomass pellets. The modernization of the Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav plant, which supplies energy to \u0160koda Auto's manufacturing facilities and provides heating for the town, represents a significant milestone in \u0160KO-ENERGO's transition to decarbonization. The project is expected to be completed by the end of 2027. The existing CFB boilers will be rebuilt in two consecutive years to ensure that the heat and power supply to the car manufacturing facility can continue without interruptions. The project is one of the largest of its kind in the Czech Republic , with part of the investment cost covered by subsidies from the Czech Republic's State Environmental Modernisation Fund. \"We are proud to support \u0160KO-ENERGO in their transition to renewable energy sources. This project will allow for the complete replacement of coal with wood chips and agro-biomass pellets, reducing CO 2 emissions by 290,000 tons annually. It is part of \u0160koda Auto's broader GreenFuture strategy to achieve carbon neutrality at the latest by 2030. This underscores Valmet's commitment to providing sustainable and efficient energy solutions,\" says Sami Riekkola , Business Line President, Pulp and Energy, Valmet. Technical information about the delivery The order includes a new Valmet BFB Boiler , which will produce steam at a rate of 80 tons per hour using wood chips as fuel. In addition, two existing coal-fired CFB boilers will be rebuilt . Initially capable of producing 140 tons of steam per hour each, both boilers will be upgraded to handle wood chips and biomass pellets, with a new capacity of 100 tons per hour each. Story Continues The new boiler will be equipped with a flue gas cleaning system consisting of a Valmet Bag House Filter (BHF) and additive injection, designed to effectively remove emissions from flue gases. The flue gas cleaning systems of the upgraded boilers will be modified, too. This enhancement ensures compliance with stringent emission limits. Valmet Industrial Internet solutions are included in the delivery. About the customer \u0160KO-ENERGO is a comprehensive energy provider based in Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav, Czech Republic .
