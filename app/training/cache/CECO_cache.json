Year 2024 Results and Highlights Key Strategic Transactions CECO Environmental Corp. Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 2:21 AM 11 min read In This Article: CECO CECO Environmental Corp. Q4 Revenue and EBITDA Negatively Impacted by Customer-Driven Project Delays Tremendous Q4 Bookings at Over $210 million Establishes New Record and Highest-Ever Backlog Completed Acquisition of Verantis in Late Q4 and Announces Intention to Divest Fluid Handling Business 2025 Full Year Outlook Affirmed ADDISON, Texas, Jan. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CECO Environmental Corp. (Nasdaq: CECO) (\"CECO\" or the \u201cCompany\u201d) , a leading environmentally focused, diversified industrial company whose solutions protect people, the environment, and industrial equipment, today announced preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024 and provided an update on further portfolio transformation. The Company also affirmed its previously announced full year 2025 outlook. Fourth Quarter and Full Year Preliminary Results For the full year ended 2024, the Company expects to report revenues in the range of $555 to $558 million, when compared to the previous guidance of $575 to $600 million, and Adjusted EBITDA between $62 to $63 million, when compared to the previous guidance of $65 to $70 million. Fourth quarter and full year revenue and Adjusted EBITDA softness were driven primarily from continued impacts related to delays of customer-driven projects. Orders for the fourth quarter 2024 are expected to be at or above $210 million, which sets a new Company record for bookings and backlog levels. \u201cMissing our 2024 outlook is disappointing \u2013 especially given the tremendous orders growth we achieved in the second half of the year,\u201d said Todd Gleason, CECO\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. \u201cThe multi-quarter, customer-driven, project delays did abate late in the year, but not in enough time for our teams to recognize the expected revenue levels from key projects. The revenues from these projects and the associated income will roll into 2025, which, along with our record orders achieved in 2024, adds even more conviction to our 2025 full year outlook. We remain very pleased with our margin expansion progress and our tremendous sales pipeline in energy transition and general industrial markets. We look forward to providing more detail on our 2024 performance and 2025 outlook when we release our full earnings report next month.\u201d The Company\u2019s preliminary fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results included in this press release are preliminary, unaudited and subject to completion, reflect management\u2019s current views, and may change as a result of management\u2019s continued review and the completion of audit procedures. Story Continues Portfolio & Transaction Update In late December 2024, the Company completed its acquisition of Verantis Environmental Solutions Group (\u201cVerantis\u201d). Verantis is a global leader in engineering services and environmental systems that focuses on process improvement in a wide range of general industrial and high technology processes, primarily for the industrial air market. Verantis had annualized sales of approximately $45 million and operating margins which are expected to be accretive to the Company. Additionally, the Company is announcing its intent to divest its Fluid Handling business which the sale is expected to be completed late in the first quarter of 2025. The proceeds from this divestiture will be used to pay down debt and position the balance sheet for future strategic growth investments. Lastly, as previously reported, the Company\u2019s acquisition of Profire Energy closed on January 3, 2025. \u201cI am very pleased with the fast start associated with the Profire integration and how many market opportunities we continue to add to our list of growth initiatives. We are also excited to welcome the Verantis team to CECO as we advance our strategic portfolio of leading environmental solution businesses to help our customers to reduce environmental footprint while improving profitability,\u201d said Todd Gleason, CECO\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. \u201cThe announced process to divest our Fluid Handling business has yielded strong interest among well-positioned leaders in the market, and we expect to complete the divestiture in late Q1. While our Fluid Handling business is very well positioned in its markets, we are laser focused on businesses that more closely align with our strategic investments and leadership positions in Air, Water and Energy Transition.\u201d 2025 Full Year Guidance Remains Unchanged The Company maintains its previously announced full year 2025 outlook which includes expected Revenue of $700 to $750 million, up approximately 30 percent at the midpoint year over year, and Adjusted EBITDA of $90 to $100 million, up approximately 50 percent at the midpoint versus 2024. The Company also affirms its full year 2025 outlook that free cash flow is expected to be between 50 and 70 percent of Adjusted EBITDA. The full year guidance incorporates the net impact of completed acquisitions, the expected Q1 sale of the Company\u2019s Fluid Handling business, and the revenue and income that rolls into 2025 associated with the 2024 customer-driven project delays. \u201cWe believe that we are very well-positioned as we enter 2025. Our key growth markets in general industrial, energy transition and power generation, are producing record bookings and our sales pipeline has never looked better. Our programmatic M&A program added tremendous businesses to our mix in the second half of 2024 and early 2025, and we expect each of these acquisitions will deliver solid growth and accretive margins to the Company. I am excited for the short- and long-term future of CECO as we expect to deliver high performance and sustainable value creation,\u201d concluded Gleason.

A \"non-GAAP financial measure\" is a numerical measure of a company's historical financial performance that excludes amounts that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA, as presented in the financial data included in this press release, has been adjusted to exclude the effects of amortization expenses for acquisition-related intangible assets, contingent retention and earnout expenses, restructuring expenses primarily relating to severance and legal expenses, acquisition and integration expenses which include retention, legal, accounting, banking, and other expenses, foreign currency remeasurement and other nonrecurring or infrequent items and the associated tax benefit of these items. Management believes that these items are not necessarily indicative of the Company\u2019s ongoing operations and their exclusion provides individuals with additional information to better compare the Company's results over multiple periods. Management utilizes this information to evaluate its ongoing financial performance. Our financial statements may continue to be affected by items similar to those excluded in the non-GAAP adjustments described above, and exclusion of these items from our non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that all such costs are unusual or infrequent. Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, and should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of our business as determined in accordance with GAAP. As a result, you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of CECO\u2019s results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, CECO cautions investors that non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Non-GAAP measures presented on a forward-looking basis were not reconciled to the comparable GAAP financial measures because the reconciliation could not be performed without unreasonable efforts. The GAAP measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis because we are currently unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the type and extent of certain items that would be expected to impact GAAP measures for these periods but would not impact the non-GAAP measures. Such items may include amortization expenses for acquisition-related intangible assets, contingent retention and earnout expenses, restructuring expenses primarily relating to severance and legal expenses, acquisition and integration expenses which include retention, legal, accounting, banking, and other expenses, foreign currency remeasurement and other nonrecurring or infrequent items and the associated tax benefit of these items. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on our GAAP financial results.

Risk Factors\" of CECO's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\u00a0December 31, 2023 and may be included in subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.\u00a0Many of these risks are beyond management's ability to control or predict. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material aspects from those currently anticipated. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements as they speak only to our views as of the date the statement is made.

Long-term Forecasts to 2035: Growing Use in Emerging Markets and Growth in Wastewater Treatment and Aquaculture Fuel Future Growth Research and Markets Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 1:30 PM 7 min read Company Logo Global Biofilter Market Global Biofilter Market Dublin, Jan. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Biofilter Market by Type, by Filter Media, by Application, by End-User, and By Region\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The global biofilter market is estimated to be USD 2.46 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach USD 6.86 billion by 2035, with a CAGR of 9.77% during the forecast period 2025-2035 The market will grow due to several factors, including growing environmental concerns and regulations, rising demand for clean air and water, growth in wastewater treatment and aquaculture, advancements in biofiltration technology, and growing use in emerging markets. Innovations in biofiltration systems - encompassing improvements in design, materials, and microbial technologies - are significantly enhancing the efficiency and appeal of biofilters. Advanced technologies, such as the integration of biofilters with digital monitoring systems, enable industries to achieve better control and optimization of air and water quality, thereby increasing the adoption of biofiltration solutions. In October 2024, Veolia Water Technology entered a partnership with the University Area Joint Authority in State College, Pennsylvania, to implement its first biological hydrolysis system in North America. This collaboration aims to improve decarbonized energy production in the region, supporting initiatives to reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainable energy solutions. North American region is anticipated to have the highest revenue share during the forecast period owing to the presence of stringent environmental regulations, well-established industrial and municipal infrastructure, and high demand for advanced biofiltration systems in sectors such as petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and wastewater treatment. Additionally, the Asia Pacific region is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period owing to the rapid industrialization, urbanization, and increasing awareness of environmental sustainability in emerging economies, which drive the demand for biofilters in air and water treatment applications. For instance, Ahlstrom began manufacturing calendared, fresh, and embossed synthetic filter media in South Korea in September 2023. Because of their larger accessible surface area and longer filter lifetime, the materials produce less flow restriction. Applications for these materials include air intake, fuel, water, and oil filtering, as well as air pollution control. By type, the activated carbon biofilter segment accounted for the highest revenue-grossing segment in the global biofilter market in 2024 owing to the widespread use of activated carbon filters in industrial and municipal applications for effectively capturing and removing contaminants, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and odors. For instance, Veolia Water Technologies established a new Life Science center of excellence in Dublin, Ireland, in October 2024. Story Continues The goal of this center is to promote water treatment innovation, training, and expansion in sectors outside of Europe's pharmaceutical, scientific, and healthcare sectors. Additionally, the biological aerated filter (BAFs) segment is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period owing to the rising adoption of BAFs in wastewater treatment, particularly in emerging economies, for their efficiency in removing organic pollutants and enhancing water quality through aerobic microbial processes. By filter media, the ceramic ring segment accounted for the highest revenue-grossing segment in the global biofilter market in 2024 owing to the high durability, large surface area, and effectiveness of ceramic rings in supporting beneficial microbial growth for effective contaminant removal. For instance, Waterloo Biofilter Systems Inc. announced in July 2024 that it had acquired RH20, Inc., a specialist in innovative moving bed biofilm reactor technology. Waterloo increased the range of technologies it offered with this breakthrough. Additionally, the bio balls segment is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period owing to its cost-effectiveness, high surface area for microbial colonization, and popularity in small-scale and aquaculture applications. By application, the volatile organic compounds (VOC) treatment segment accounted for the highest revenue-grossing segment in the global biofilter market in 2024 owing to the increased regulatory pressure on industries to reduce VOC emissions and the biofilters' effective performance in controlling VOC emissions across sectors like petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and manufacturing. For instance, Nofima and UiT established a new advanced research center in Tromso in January 2023, which helps the aquaculture industry better understand onshore fish farming and gives youth training opportunities and jobs in rural regions. Additionally, the odor abatement segment is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period owing to its expanding use in municipal and industrial facilities to control odor emissions in response to community and environmental regulations. By end-user, the aquaculture segment accounted for the highest revenue-grossing segment in the global biofilter market in 2024 owing to the critical role of biofilters in maintaining water quality and removing toxic ammonia levels, which are essential for healthy fish populations. For instance, in July 2024, advanced moving bed biofilm reactor technology (MBBR) expert RH2O Inc. will be acquired by Waterloo Biofilter Systems Inc., a major pioneer in on-site wastewater treatment, subject to standard closing conditions. Through this investment, Waterloo Biofilter's total technological capabilities and market position as a reliable supplier of wastewater treatment solutions are strengthened. Going forward, current RH2O clients will be serviced by Waterloo Biofilter, which is currently among the biggest maintenance suppliers in the nation. Additionally, the water & wastewater collection segment is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period owing to the increasing investment in wastewater treatment infrastructure to meet environmental standards and address water scarcity issues worldwide.

{"text": "Is CECO (CECO) a Solid Growth Stock? 3 Reasons to Think \"Yes\" Zacks Equity Research Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 8:45 PM 3 min read In This Article: CECO Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all. By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss. However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks. Our proprietary system currently recommends CECO Environmental (CECO) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank. Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better. Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of air pollution controls and industrial ventilation systems a great growth pick right now. Earnings Growth Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration. While the historical EPS growth rate for CECO is 8%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 73.9% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 15.5%. Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio Growth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales. Right now, CECO has an S/TA ratio of 0.92, which means that the company gets $0.92 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.88, it can be said that the company is more efficient. In addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And CECO looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 22.7% this year versus the industry average of 11.9%. Story Continues Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. The current-year earnings estimates for CECO have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 4.6% over the past month.

Lately, water conservation and carbon capture\u2013which requires hydrogen and other gasses as well as specialized infrastructure\u2013have been trending up, creating new demand for products such as filters, pumps, and valves. On the other hand, gas and liquid handling companies are at the whim of economic cycles. Consumer spending and interest rates, for example, can greatly impact the industrial production that drives demand for these companies\u2019 offerings.

Todd Gleason, CECO\u2019s Chief Executive Officer commented, \u201cWhile our third quarter produced very strong orders and a new record backlog, we were disappointed that we fell short of the anticipated quarterly revenue and income outlook as a handful of customer-driven delays in larger projects could not be overcome by continued progress with margin expansion and other actions. \u201d CECO Total Revenue CECO delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates and slowest revenue growth of the whole group.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 5 Quality Compounder Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

(NASDAQ:CECO) Mixed Financials The Reason For Its Gloomy Performance on The Stock Market? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Mon, Dec 30, 2024, 2:27 PM 3 Minuten Lesezeit In diesem Artikel: CECO It is hard to get excited after looking at CECO Environmental's (NASDAQ:CECO) recent performance, when its stock has declined 8.0% over the past month. We, however decided to study the company's financials to determine if they have got anything to do with the price decline. Fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes so it makes sense to study the company's financials. In this article, we decided to focus on CECO Environmental's ROE. Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for CECO Environmental How Is ROE Calculated? Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for CECO Environmental is: 5.6% = US$14m \u00f7 US$246m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024). The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.06 in profit. What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth? Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics. CECO Environmental's Earnings Growth And 5.6% ROE When you first look at it, CECO Environmental's ROE doesn't look that attractive. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 12%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. As a result, CECO Environmental reported a very low income growth of 2.5% over the past five years. Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that CECO Environmental's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 9.7% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see. NasdaqGS:CECO Past Earnings Growth December 30th 2024 Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if CECO Environmental is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E , relative to its industry. Weiterlesen Is CECO Environmental Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits? CECO Environmental doesn't pay any regular dividends, meaning that potentially all of its profits are being reinvested in the business. This doesn't explain the low earnings growth number that we discussed above. So there could be some other explanation in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating. Conclusion On the whole, we feel that the performance shown by CECO Environmental can be open to many interpretations. While the company does have a high rate of reinvestment, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping any benefit to its investors, and moreover, its having a negative impact on the earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.
