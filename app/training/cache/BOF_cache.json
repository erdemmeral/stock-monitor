[{"text": "Prada defied the China-led luxury slowdown\u2014its CEO is bullish Chinese shoppers will return A Miu Miu store in Hong Kong, where Prada is listed. \u00b7 Fortune \u00b7 Sebastian Ng\u2014SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images Prarthana Prakash Thu, Jan 16, 2025, 9:00 AM 3 min read In This Article: PRDSY -2.18% Prada has recently become an outlier in the luxury market. While many big players struggled to pick themselves up amid weaker shopping appetites from their high-end clientele, Italian-born Prada has had a dream streak. In the nine months to September, the company generated \u20ac3.8 billion in revenue, up 17.5% from the same period a year earlier. Much of that growth came from a niche sister brand called Miu Miu, which captured the imagination of Gen Z and has been sported by celebrities like Gigi Hadid and Sydney Sweeney. It was also one of the earliest brands to use actresses rather than models in its campaigns . Analysts expect the brand to continue to boom, doubling sales to about \u20ac2 billion. Miuccia Prada, granddaughter of Prada\u2019s founder, is the creative director at Miu Miu and co-creative lead at Prada. Prada even recorded growth in the Asia Pacific region, a challenging market (outside of Japan) for some of its larger peers, like LVMH. The lackluster performance in Asia has forced luxury majors like Gucci owner Kering to issue profit warnings . Prada CEO Andrea Guerra remains bullish on China nonetheless. \u201cWe believe in the long-term [potential] of Chinese consumers and China\u2014strongly\u2014but 2024 and I think part of 2025 will not be easy in that part of the world,\u201d he told Business of Fashion . \u201cDemand is still there; people are still wishing and dreaming about luxury.\u201d Other luxury companies expect Chinese demand to eventually rebound . But the last few years have made one thing apparent: while the country is a significant player, relying on it to drive growth may no longer work. Luxury fashion is not expected to fully recover for a few more years due to various reasons, from Donald Trump-sanctioned tariffs to the rise of boutique brands. \u201cThe industry is at a turning point: you have turmoil in creativity, turmoil in companies\u2019 leadership, and for the first time in years, you have some negative numbers like the industry has never seen,\u201d Guerra said. Under Guerra, who was appointed the first non-family Prada chief in 2023, the company has opened more stores, hosted stunning shows, and become part of a broader cultural moment. Like other luxury labels, it\u2019s also hiked prices significantly, but customers haven\u2019t turned against it yet. In turn, Guerra emphasizes stores to strengthen its customer relationships. The Hong Kong-listed Prada spent over $800 million on stores on New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue. \u201cStores are a tool for something that has completely changed in the last six, seven years at Prada, which is our relationship with the Prada consumer or potential consumers,\u201d he said. The luxury chief knows the company\u2019s responsibility for standing out, especially as a smaller fish in the luxury ocean filled with conglomerates. Story Continues One area in which he\u2019s noticed growth is experiential luxury via hospitality, which is forecasted to be a significant growth area as shoppers gravitate to travel and wellness over bags and clothes. \u201cAt Prada, we\u2019ll need to do an even better job in order to keep growing over the industry average and gaining back the market share I think we deserve,\u201d Guerra said. The luxury brand is unique in more ways than just how it runs its business.\u00a0It has also taken a unique approach to succession, so Prada remains independent in a fierce luxury market where deals in Italian fashion are rampant. The 30-something Lorenzo Bertelli, son of Patrizio Bertelli and Miuccia Prada, is poised to take the reins someday and is being groomed within the company. \u201cOur two founders are still very young in spirit. They work seven days a week, thinking about the future of their brands in terms of decades,\u201d Guerra says of Bertelli and Prada, adding that the company\u2019s unusual approach keeps it in the game long term. Representatives at Prada didn\u2019t immediately return Fortune \u2019s request for comment.

Market\u00a0Challenges \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Metallurgical coal is an essential resource in steel production, as it is used to create coke. The cost of metallurgical coal is influenced by global demand for iron and steel, making it more expensive than thermal coal. Prices for metallurgical coal are volatile due to macroeconomic factors, including global steel demand and trading policies of major consumers like China . For instance, India , the world's second-largest crude steel producer and a significant importer of coking coal, experienced a 49% increase in coking coal prices between May and November 2023 . These fluctuations make the market unreliable, with prices reaching as high as USD365 per ton in October 2023 . Despite predictions of falling prices, the value of Australia's metallurgical coal exports is expected to decrease due to these price fluctuations. The volatility of metallurgical coal prices acts as a barrier to market growth. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Metallurgical coal, including bituminous, sub-bituminous, lignite, and coking coal, plays a crucial role in industries like steelmaking and electricity generation. Coking coal's primary use is in steel production, where it transforms into carbon-rich coke during the coking process, essential for iron ore to produce pig iron in the steelmaking process. However, challenges persist. Coal quality factors like caking ability, ash content, volatile matter, sulfur, and phosphorus impact coke production efficiency and steel quality. In electricity generation, non-coking coal is used, but its heating process requires careful consideration due to its lower heating value and higher ash content. Coal classification, based on vitrinite content, helps determine coal's suitability for various uses. Coking coals have high vitrinite content, while non-coking coals have low vitrinity. Metallurgical coke production relies on coal's caking property and plasticity. The steel industry and thermal power plants face a demand-supply gap due to depleting coal reserves and increasing environmental concerns. Coal blending and characterization, including coal washing and coking index determination, are essential to optimize coal usage and improve product quality. Additionally, metallurgical coal is used in producing ferro-chromium, ferro-manganese, carbon electrodes, pesticides, chemical products, carbon fibers, and medicines. The challenges in the metallurgical coal market include ensuring consistent coal quality, managing the supply chain, and addressing environmental concerns.

"Best of the Week: Preparing for a New Trump Era trump \u00b7 CoinDesk Benjamin Schiller Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 7:33 PM 2 min read CoinDesk\u2019s coverage kicked into high gear this week as crypto readied for a new presidency and a new regulatorily-friendly era. Some highlights:Senior analyst James Van Straten reported on a wave of companies buying bitcoin for their balance sheets , following a model pioneered by MicroStrategy\u2019s Michael Saylor. Markets reporter Krisztian Sandor followed the rise of Solana's SOL, XRP and Hedera's HBAR on rumors that Trump might support an America-first crypto \u201creserve\u201d to complement a national bitcoin holding. Markets Co-Managing Editor Omkar Godbole delved into why bitcoin continues to be in a trough price-wise. But he said the recent selloff won\u2019t hurt long-term institutional adoption. Ian Allison, senior reporter, caught up with new Binance.US chief Norman Reed, who revealed how SEC officials had tried to choke off the exchange\u2019s banking relationships as part of its 2022 investigation . Asia reporter Sam Reynolds looked into how regulators in several countries had recently tried to ban Polymarket as prediction markets contend with gambling laws. (Kalshi, however, gained Donald Trump Jnr. as an advisor, showing how the U.S. may now become a safe haven for crypto companies.) In a preview of what is expected to be a vibrant time for M&A activity, Ctrl Wallet, a self-custody wallet, revealed that it is up for sale , Allison reported. Meanwhile, crypto ETFs are expected to surge in volume, following 2024\u2019s seismic debut. Litecoin, an early bitcoin clone, is the next project expected to get official approval for ETF trading , reporter Tom Carreras said. Helene Braun followed up to say that a Litecoin ETF could attract $580 million in inflows, if the vehicle proves as attractive as bitcoin was last year. On the regulatory front, Deputy Managing Editor Jesse Hamilton reported the Trump administration wants to make crypto\u2019s \u201cde-banking\u201d issues a first order of concern . Meanwhile, the SEC and CFTC continued to clear-house of \u201canti-crypto\u201d officials , preparing the way for new administrators to join in the coming weeks, Hamilton said. As the weekend approaches, the crypto world was set to descend on Washington D.C. for a series of inauguration parties and balls. CoinDesk will have full live coverage on Monday, so stay tuned.

Eye Big Moves While Bitcoin in Stasis Ahead of CPI Omkar Godbole, Oliver Knight Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 3:01 PM 11 min read By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) The market is about to be hit with the first big U.S. economic event of 2025: December CPI data. With hawkish Fed fears in the air and bitcoin strengthening its correlation with tech stocks, Wednesday's report becomes even more significant for the digital assets market. The stalled liquidity inflows through stablecoins have also raised question marks on the sustainability of price recovery from under $90K, and traders are preparing for potential downside volatility by adding short-dated puts. Here\u2019s what experts are saying about the upcoming event: QCP Capital \"In crypto, cautious sentiment is evident in BTC options flows, with puts rolled below the key $90k support. Front-end vols and flies remain elevated, while the VIX stays high at 18.68 \u2013 suggesting volatility to persist through January.\" Geoffrey Chen, author of the Fidenza Macro blog \"The rising markets in November and the lifting of election uncertainty pushed business confidence higher, resulting in stronger data. The frontloading of goods imports and the raising of prices to get ahead of tariffs may have also contributed to higher PMIs. On top of that, oil has woken up and rallied over 10% from its December levels, reinforcing the stagflation regime. None of this bodes well for CPI tomorrow [Jan. 15] and the FOMC later this month. These risk events may surprise towards hawkish and stagflationary outcomes, putting more pressure on risk assets.\u201d Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research \"Bitcoin continues to trade within a narrowing wedge, with several critical catalysts on the horizon. Expectations for a higher CPI number have risen, creating a scenario where a softer-than-expected inflation reading could trigger a bitcoin rally.\" Focus on XRP and AI XRP surged to $2.90 early today, matching the December high with technical analysis suggesting a continued run higher. Meanwhile, according to Wintermute, dip buyers have been active in AI coins, namely FAI, GRASS, VIRTUAL, Ai16z and TAO. These coins, therefore, could chalk out bigger gains in case the CPI spurs renewed risk-taking in financial markets.

BTC's Price Action is Inverse of December Peak Above $108K Omkar Godbole Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 9:21 AM 2 min read The pressing question on crypto traders' minds is: Has bitcoin's (BTC) price weakness run its course, or is there more to come? The former appears to be the case as Monday's price action, characterized by a swift recovery from intraday lows, contrasted with mid-December when the rally stalled and turned lower from record highs above $108,000. On Monday, BTC initially fell as investment banks scaled back expectations for Fed rate cuts, with some discussing the potential for rate hikes following Friday's stellar jobs report, causing prices to dip below the lower end of the key support zone of $90,000-$93,000 as major U.S. stock indices gapped lower . The breakdown of the support, however, was short-lived, and by the end of the day, BTC had surged back to $94,000, leaving behind a classic \" long-legged Doji candle .\" The long wick signifies downtrend exhaustion, indicating that although sellers initially drove prices lower, buyers ultimately overpowered them. This pattern is often seen as a potential signal of a bottom, mainly when it occurs at key support levels or after a notable price drop, as is the case for BTC. The long-legged doji has emerged at the support zone (horizontal lines) that has consistently restricted the downside since late November. An inverse of the above is what we saw on Dec. 16 when the bulls failed to keep prices at record highs above $108,000, printing a doji candle with a longer upper shadow. That was a sign of the uptrend running out of steam, with sellers looking to reassert themselves. What next? While Monday's price action hints at a potential bottom, confirmation is required in the form of a decisive move above the day's high of $95,900. Chart-driven directional traders typically wait for that before hitting the market with fresh buy orders. Meanwhile, Monday's low near $89,000 is now the level to beat for the bears. Note that BTC's demand-supply dynamics continue to lean bullishly. As Bitwise's Head of Research - Europe Andre Dragosch pointed out on X , the corporate demand for BTC has already outpaced the supply of new coins this year. Price volatility may pick up again on the back of Wednesday's U.S. CPI report, which could influence Fed rate cut expectations. \"After Monday's sharp drop, Bitcoin rebounded from a low of $89K, as traders await the U.S. CPI report on Jan. 15. Major altcoins followed suit, with many losing more in the last 24 hours,\" Neal Wen, head of global business development at Kronos Research, told CoinDesk. \"Market watchers are now focused on signs of stability to see further downside or upside,\" Wen added.

Bitcoin Price Higher Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation (Maria Lin Kim/Unsplash) \u00b7 CoinDesk Krisztian  Sandor Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 4:40 PM 2 min read While headline inflation came in faster than hoped in December, investors for the moment are in buy mode after an unexpected decline in the year-over-year core rate. The closely-watched Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 0.4% in December, slightly higher than analyst consensus and the previous month's 0.3%. On a year-over-year basis, CPI was up 2.9%, compared to analyst forecasts for 2.9% and previous month's reading at 2.7%. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy costs, rose 0.2% in December, versus expectations for 0.2% and the previous month's 0.3% figure. Core CPI year-over-year, however, dipped to 3.2% against forecasts for 3.3% and the November rate of 3.3%. The core pace of inflation is of considerable import to policymakers, who have expressed at least a modest bit of frustration over its stickiness above 3% as headline inflation fell at a far quicker pace. The price of bitcoin ( BTC ) rose about $1,500 in the minutes following the report to $98,500 following the report, up 2% over the past 24 hours, CoinDesk data shows. In traditional markets, U.S. stock index futures added about 0.5% after the data, while bond yields and the dollar both sharply declined. Crypto markets have traded rangebound through January at the whims of macroeconomic data and monetary policy expectations amidst a strong economy and concerns of sticky inflation. Bitcoin consolidated mostly below $100,000 since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's hawkish comments in December. That, along with a string of stronger-than-forecast economic and inflation data, led market participants to nearly erase all expectations for rate cuts this year. Most recently, Tuesday's Producer Price Index (PPI) for December showed cooler than expected inflation readings, supporting BTC's rebound to $97,000 following the abrupt sell-off below $90,000 earlier in the week.

By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) \"I don't understand how can anyone think BTC is not a bargain at these prices...,\" Andre Dragosch, head of research - Europe at Bitwise, said on X Monday as BTC's price dipped below $90,000. While the comment may appear overly optimistic to macro bears, it is not without justification. Even as the DXY, Treasury yields, and Fed rate expectations look to destabilize risk assets, corporate and institutional demand for BTC continues to strengthen. Intesa Sanpaolo, Italy\u2019s largest bank by market capitalization, has reportedly purchased BTC, snapping up 11 BTC for $1 million. That could accelerate crypto adoption in the European Union's third-largest economy, which already has 1.4 million citizens holding cryptocurrencies. If that's not enough, corporate Treasury purchases of BTC have already reached 5,774 BTC in the first two weeks of January, outpacing the supply of new BTC. To Dragosch's credit, BTC has bounced to over $96K, hinting at an end of the price weakness that began a month ago at record highs above $108K. As usual, that has brought cheer to all corners of the crypto market, with AI, gaming and meme sub-sectors leading the charge. The recovery, supported by ongoing institutional adoption and rumors of President-elect Donald Trump planning to issue an executive order addressing crypto-accounting SEC rules on day one, suggests that bears may find it difficult to assert their influence. Prices may move into six figures if Tuesday's U.S. producer price index points to softer inflation in the pipeline, weakening the hawkish Fed narrative. Note that the dollar index's rally has already stalled amid reports that Trump's tariffs will be gradual and smaller than initially feared.

The marketplace has integration with multiple social channels including X, allowing for agents to be deployed on these channels after launch. Despite enduring a steep correction, AI tokens have outperformed every other basket class within the cryptocurrency space so far this year, owing their returns to a significant surge seen in the first week of the year. CCData\u2019s basket performance shows that year-to-date, AI tokens are up 2.5%, while the second-best performing class, exchange tokens, is up less than 0.5%. On the other end of the spectrum, real world asset (RWA) tokens are down more than 14% , significantly underperforming memecoins, which dropped roughly 10% in this month\u2019s correction. Usual Protocol, the popular decentralized finance protocol that came under fire last week over an unexpected change in its redemption mechanism, has activated its Revenue Switch for USUALx holders. Solana-based token launchpad Pump.fun has moved 122,620 SOL worth over $21 million to Kraken, bringing their total deposited funds to 1.785 million SOL worth $362 million, Onchain Lens revealed . The FTX estate has executed its monthly SOL redemption transfer, unstaking 182,421 SOL and moving the funds to 20 different addresses. Since November, FTX has redeemed over $500 million in SOL, and it still holds $1.18 billion in its staking address. Derivatives Positioning Large cap tokens, excluding XLM, XRP and HYPE, have seen a decline in perpetual futures open interest in the past 24 hours. Front-end BTC and ETH options risk reversals show neutral sentiment despite the price recovery. Near-dated and long-term options show a bias for calls. Block flows featured large purchase of calls at $95K and $98K expiring in the next two weeks and an ETH bull call spread, involving March 28 expiry calls at $5.5K and $6.5K.

Biden Blocks U.S. Steel Sale Editor OilPrice.com Wed, Jan 8, 2025, 9:00 PM 6 min read In This Article: X -1.11% CLF -4.88% Via Metal Miner The Raw Steels Monthly Metals Index (MMI) remained sideways with a slight downside bias, falling 1.49% from December to January. Meanwhile, the blocked sale of U.S. Steel could significantly affect steel prices in 2025. Biden Blocks Nippon-U.S. Steel Sale After the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) came to a split decision, the sale of U.S. steel met a bitter end. In early January, President Biden made good on his promises to block Japan\u2019s Nippon Steel Corporation from acquiring the mill. Nippon\u2019s $14.9 billion bid came roughly a year ago, in late December 2023. The amount beat out others, including Cleveland-Cliffs, who had offered $7.3 billion to buy the oft-underperforming company. Poll results from MetalMiner\u2019s May 8 newsletter. Join the MetalMiner community and follow all of our recent coverage on the Nippon-U.S. Steel deal. Sign up for the free weekly MetalMiner newsletter here . The sale has faced a multitude of setbacks since U.S. Steel shareholders accepted Nippon\u2019s bid. A number of prominent voices came out against the sale. In addition to Biden, these included President-elect Trump, J.D. Vance and the USW. Vance argued that foreign ownership of a critical American manufacturing entity could undermine the nation\u2019s industrial base and compromise security interests. He also suggested that such acquisitions might serve as a form of tariff arbitrage, allowing foreign companies to bypass trade barriers without contributing to domestic production expansion. Executives from Cliffs were also quick to cast doubt on the acquisition, noting the U.S. Steel was \u201cdenying reality\u201d by believing that the deal would go through. The company noted , \u201cAfter decades of unfair trade practices causing harm to American steel companies and union jobs, it is no surprise to us that the United Steelworkers union (USW) adamantly opposes any transaction involving Nippon Steel, a company with an extensive track record of injurious trade practices.\u201d Concerns About Nippon-U.S. Steel Acquisition Critics of the deal mostly pointed toward national security concerns, and it is true that the U.S. has placed increased focus on its critical industries in the years following the pandemic. As a result, mergers involving foreign-owned companies can raise concerns about dependence on foreign entities regarding sensitive technologies and crucial materials. For instance, the widespread use of steel in vital industries, including the defense, infrastructure and automotive industries, makes the sector of strategic importance. Story Continues Other concerns stemmed from United Steelworkers. For example, Nippon made several promises to the USW in an effort to gain the union\u2019s support. This included roughly $2.7 billion worth of investments in the company, $5,000 payouts to steelworkers and a vow to honor collective bargaining agreements. The firm also promised not to sell steel from its overseas mills to the U.S and made a 10-year commitment to preserve production capacity. While many rank-and-file union members supported the transaction, the USW remained opposed, accusing Nippon of \u201cempty promises\u201d and being a \u201cserial trade cheater for decades that would undermine our domestic industry.\u201d Blockage Brings Bad News for Steel Buyers Despite high-profile support for President Biden\u2019s decision, the blockage of the deal comes with many drawbacks. As MetalMiner\u2019s own Lisa Reisman states , \u201cIn the end, politics won out.\u201d Moreover, the CFIUS started to face fresh accusations of corruption in the wake of its inability to come to a decision, which left an open door for Biden block. Considering that Japan remains a U.S. ally and Nippon agreed to unravel a joint venture with China\u2019s Baoshan, concerns over national security have been heavily scrutinized. Instead, many believe \u201cthat a strengthened partnership with Japan can enhance U.S. supply chain resilience and foster technological collaboration.\u201d Beyond that, the deal would have brought several other benefits to the U.S. For instance, the significant investments in a number of U.S. Steel\u2019s facilities and capacity agreements would have meant job security for steelworkers. Indeed, U.S. Steel\u2019s under-performance will continue to put both jobs and the fate of certain facilities in limbo. Many believe that the next steps will see the mill looking for cost-cutting solutions. Cleveland Cliffs Does Not Have a Clear Path to Ownership A significant number of industry insiders also believe that Nippon\u2019s ownership would have promoted competition within the steel space, including for electrical steel and BOF-produced steel. This would mean more competitive pricing for buyers. As of September, Cliffs had maintained its willingness to buy U.S. Steel, albeit now at a much lower price. Whether by Cliffs or another U.S. producer, another merger in the U.S. market would further consolidate the industry, giving mills more control of steel price dynamics. Historically, that has meant higher prices regardless of underlying demand conditions. There will be plenty of anti-trust concerns should Cliffs attempt to purchase U.S. Steel, which might undermine their efforts. For example. Cliffs is the only other U.S. producer with BOF facilities as part of their operations. This would give the company complete national control over that production method, which is favored by the automotive industry. As a result, the UAW will likely oppose the potential sale to Cliffs. Nippon, U.S. Steel Sue While the deal appears to be dead in the water, the legal battle is far from over. Both Nippon and U.S. Steel leveled lawsuits in hopes of overturning Biden\u2019s decision. The companies allege that the sitting president unfairly influenced the CFIUS\u2019s panel. According to a statement, \u201cAs a result of President Biden\u2019s undue influence to advance his political agenda, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States failed to conduct a good faith, national security-focused regulatory review process.\u201d The companies also set their legal sights on Cleveland-Cliffs and the USW. In a second lawsuit, the companies allege Cliffs, Cliffs\u2019 CEO Lourenco Goncalves and USW\u2019s McCall conspired to quash the deal through \u201cillegal and coordinated actions,\u201d which would ultimately allow Cliffs to \u201cmonopolize the domestic steel markets.\u201d Steel Prices Seem Poised to Rise in the Long Term While it remains unclear what will come from the most recent lawsuits, the end of the deal seems to mean bad news for buyers. Purchase by another domestic mill or the closure or curtailment of certain facilities should U.S. Steel look to cut costs would mean higher steel prices. Still, this may take time to come to fruition, and the result of the lawsuits could change the course of events. Nevertheless, the risk to steel prices remains to the upside.

Risks Losing Key Support Zone as Risk Assets Struggle Omkar Godbole, Oliver Knight Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 2:56 PM 11 \u5206\u9418\u95b1\u8b80\u6642\u9593 By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Risk assets are trading down as the dollar index and Treasury yields benefit from Friday's blowout nonfarm payrolls report and the Palisades Fires posing a risk to the insurance sector and some P&C companies. BTC is down 2%, changing hands in the key support zone of $90,000 and $93,000, with alternative cryptocurrencies posting bigger losses as usual. ETH has dropped to the lowest since Dec. 21 and the risk-off has clouded XRP's bullish technical outlook (see TA section). Whales likely accumulated XRP over South Korea-based Upbit over the weekend. AI coins is the worst performing sub-sector of the past 24 hours. In traditional markets, futures tied to the S&P 500 point to negative open alongside continued downside volatility in the British pound and emerging market currencies. The risk-off sentiment, however, didn't stop Michael Saylor from indicating a potential for another bitcoin purchase as he shared an update on MicroStrategy's bitcoin purchase tracker. If it would put a dent into the negative market sentiment, is another story. \"The firm's purchase last Monday amounted to approximately $100 million, which had limited market impact, but underscores the firm's ongoing demand,\" Valentin Fournier, analyst at BRN said. Other things being equal, the risk of BTC losing the support zone appears high as some investment banks believe the Fed rate-cutting cycle is over, with Bank of America suggesting a potential for a rate hike. Per some observers , the consensus is that prices will deflate to $70K, followed by a renewed rally.

/ December 17, 2024 / ToolsGroup , a global leader in retail and supply chain planning and optimization software, is excited to announce its participation in the National Retail Federation's Retail's Biggest Show, taking place January 12-14, 2025, in New York. ToolsGroup invites NRF attendees to Booth #4043 to explore its retail planning technology, including the launch of Inventory.io, designed to help businesses prepare for the unknown in 2025. Retailers are increasingly concerned about the year ahead as they grapple with potential tariffs and broader economic uncertainties. According to McKinsey & Company and BoF Insights' State of Fashion 2025 report, achieving Inventory Excellence is a critical priority for retailers aiming to remain profitable amidst these economic challenges. Inventory.io's AI-powered learning engines and prescriptive optimization are designed to help businesses manage fluctuating demand across complex, omnichannel retail supply chains with precision. Optimizing inventory in season reduces the risk of costly stockouts and overstocks, enabling businesses to preserve strong margins and profitability, even during periods of uncertainty. Early adopters of the Inventory.io engines have achieved profit increases of 12% on average, driven by a 25% reduction in stockouts and a 20% increase in turns. \"Retailers are grappling with a perfect storm of challenges, making retail planning more complex, and getting it right more important than ever before,\" said Inna Kuznetsova, CEO of ToolsGroup. \"With over 30 years of innovation, our AI-powered solutions and unique probabilistic planning capabilities empower businesses to stay competitive and adaptable in an increasingly dynamic and uncertain market.\" At NRF, ToolsGroup will showcase our industry leading solutions designed to help retailers weather this retail uncertainty. Price.io and Promo.io maximize margins and revenues with AI-driven price recommendations that hit or exceed planned sales rates while ensuring all promotions deliver positive ROI, even with minimal or dirty data. By adopting dynamic pricing now, retailers will be able to react to changing costs, shifting demand, and market downturns or inflation in a way that preserves profits. Additionally, Markdown.io preserves that increased margin through end-of-the-season discounts while maximizing sustainability. NRF 2025 is the world's largest retail tradeshow that brings together nearly 45,000 attendees and 6,000 brands from around the globe to New York City to network and discuss innovative strategies for breaking through and driving change.
