Fuller's (NYSE:FUL) Conservative Accounting Might Explain Soft Earnings editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 3:47 PM 2 min read In This Article: FUL -2.44% Soft earnings didn't appear to concern H.B. Fuller Company's ( NYSE:FUL ) shareholders over the last week. We think that the softer headline numbers might be getting counterbalanced by some positive underlying factors. Check out our latest analysis for H.B. Fuller NYSE:FUL Earnings and Revenue History January 24th 2025 How Do Unusual Items Influence Profit? For anyone who wants to understand H.B. Fuller's profit beyond the statutory numbers, it's important to note that during the last twelve months statutory profit was reduced by US$50m due to unusual items. While deductions due to unusual items are disappointing in the first instance, there is a silver lining. When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated. And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies. Assuming those unusual expenses don't come up again, we'd therefore expect H.B. Fuller to produce a higher profit next year, all else being equal. That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates. Our Take On H.B. Fuller's Profit Performance Because unusual items detracted from H.B. Fuller's earnings over the last year, you could argue that we can expect an improved result in the current quarter. Because of this, we think H.B. Fuller's earnings potential is at least as good as it seems, and maybe even better! Unfortunately, though, its earnings per share actually fell back over the last year. Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors. If you'd like to know more about H.B. Fuller as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing. To help with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs (1 can't be ignored!) that you ought to be aware of before buying any shares in H.B. Fuller.

(ECL) the Best Soaps and Cleaning Materials Stock to Invest In? Noor Ul Ain Rehman Mon, Jan 20, 2025, 3:28 PM 5 min read In This Article: ECL -0.27% We recently published a list of the 10 Best Soaps and Cleaning Materials Stocks to Invest In . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Ecolab Inc. (NYSE: ECL ) stands against other best soaps and cleaning materials stocks to invest in. Overview of the Consumer Staple Sector Soaps and cleaning materials stocks fall in the consumer staple sector. According to the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), these stocks are less sensitive to economic cycles, as all consumers need to eat, clean themselves and their houses, and perform other acts of personal hygiene. Consumer staples are thus an integral part of life. These stocks generally do not have the highest year-over-year revenue and earnings growth. This is primarily because they are usually mature and large companies. However, the consumer staples sector has historically experienced relatively minute disruption. Stocks in this sector have various other characteristics that overshadow their modest growth. These characteristics include noncyclic and inelastic demand that does not fluctuate with changing prices and economic conditions. They also entail stable revenue streams, reliable profits, low price volatility, defensive positioning, and a reliable dividend-paying nature. What Does 2025 Look Like for Consumer Staples? On December 10, Ben Shuleva, Fidelity Sector Portfolio Manager, published a report on Fidelity Investments to discuss the outlook and expected nature of consumer staples in 2025. The consumer staples sector had a positive year in 2024. Shuleva is of the view that with sector dynamics returning to normal, 2025 is also expected to have a positive outlook for the sector. Solid consumer balance sheets, a strong economy, and support from the Fed may help the sector perform better than the broader market. Opportunities thus exist in consumer staples in 2025. Stable consumer demand, steady real wage growth, and healthy employment are further expected to support these opportunities. However, Shuleva warned that some uncertainties may affect the sector. These include trade policy changes that may arise due to Trump\u2019s incoming presidential administration, the effects of tariffs, and the potential consequences of the dollar\u2019s strength or weakness. He further highlighted that since most consumer staple products are manufactured in the United States, the direct effects of tariffs are expected to be limited. However, products like Mexican alcohol and Chinese items sold by consumer staples retailers may experience price increases. Shuleva also presented a bright side to the sector, reasoning that since consumer staple businesses have experienced volatility from changing tariff policies in recent years, they are likely to be well-prepared for them. Like other sectors, the consumer staples sector\u2019s ultimate performance depends upon the broader economy\u2019s performance. It is a defensive sector, and defensive sectors are historically likely to perform well in economic weaknesses.

Release Date: January 16, 2025 For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript . Positive Points H.B. Fuller Co ( NYSE:FUL ) achieved a record adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.6% for the fiscal year 2024, indicating strong operational performance. The company made significant progress in reducing net working capital requirements and maintaining a stable leverage ratio. Strategic acquisitions, such as GEM Srl and Medifill Ltd, are expected to enhance market presence in the medical adhesives sector. The Construction Adhesives segment showed strong performance with a 10.5% year-on-year increase in organic sales, driven by roofing growth. H.B. Fuller Co ( NYSE:FUL ) plans to reduce its global manufacturing footprint, which is expected to generate approximately $75 million in annualized cost savings once complete. Negative Points The fourth quarter saw an unexpected deceleration in volume across most end markets, impacting overall performance. Organic sales were down slightly in the fourth quarter, reflecting a weakening economic backdrop. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was down 14% year-on-year, with a decline in adjusted EBITDA margin to 16.1%. The HHC segment experienced a marked slowdown in volume growth and negative pricing year-on-year. The company faced higher raw material costs and delayed pricing actions, leading to margin pressure. Q & A Highlights Q : Can you speak to the cash cost to implement the restructuring plan and the flow-through of expected savings? A : Celeste Mastin, CEO: The plan is aggressive but achievable. We have a global footprint with redundancies and opportunities for growth. We plan to reduce facilities from 82 to 55 by 2030, with 16 reductions by the end of 2025. John Corkrean, CFO: Savings should be roughly $5 million in 2025, stepping up to $20 million in 2026, reaching a $75 million run rate. The cost to implement is estimated between $25 million and $50 million, with capital costs of $150 million over five years. Story Continues Q : What is the level of price increase you're expecting for fiscal 2025? A : Celeste Mastin, CEO: We anticipate a 0% to 2% price increase, with volume down mostly across the total business in 2025. In HHC, significant raw material cost increases were not fully offset by price increases in Q4, but we are implementing them in Q1. Q : Can you elaborate on the weakness in the packaging and consumer markets? A : Celeste Mastin, CEO: In Q4, we saw a deceleration in 10 out of 13 HHC market segments, including consumer-packaged goods. There may be inventory rationalization at customers, and distributors are cautious. However, we are gaining market share in flexible packaging through innovation. Q : Why were margins down significantly in Q4, and how are volumes tracking in Q1? A : Celeste Mastin, CEO: Margins were down due to raw material cost increases, particularly in HHC. John Corkrean, CFO: Q1 volumes are modestly better, but Q1 is typically our lowest margin quarter. We expect pricing actions to show more impact in Q2. Q : How are you managing execution risk and customer service during the manufacturing footprint optimization? A : Celeste Mastin, CEO: We are consolidating within the existing footprint and reducing redundancy, particularly in HHC. We are confident in our operational leadership and have piloted location closures successfully. The focus is on reducing costs and improving service.

Story Continues Summary of Fourth Quarter 2024 Results: The Company\u2019s net revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 was $923 million, up 2.3% versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Organic revenue declined 0.2% year-on-year, with pricing adjustments reducing organic revenue by 1.5% and volume increasing organic revenue by 1.3%. Foreign currency translation decreased net revenue by 0.2%, and acquisitions increased net revenue by 2.7%. Gross profit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 was $265 million. Adjusted gross profit was $273 million. Adjusted gross profit margin of 29.6% decreased 170 basis points year-on-year. Unfavorable pricing in conjunction with higher raw material costs, principally led to the decline in adjusted gross margin year-on-year. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense was $188 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and adjusted SG&A was $174 million, up 12 percent year-on-year. The impact of acquisitions and higher variable compensation drove most of the year-on-year increase in adjusted SG&A. Net income/(loss) attributable to H.B. Fuller for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 was ($7) million, including an unfavorable $38 million non-cash, after-tax impact related to the Flooring divestiture. Adjusted net income attributable to H.B. Fuller for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 was $52 million. Adjusted EPS was $0.92 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 was $148 million, down 14% year-on-year, driven by unfavorable raw material cost developments, delayed price realization, and higher variable compensation expense. \"Overall, I am proud of the progress we made in fiscal year 2024. We continued to expand adjusted EBITDA margin and enhanced the profile of our portfolio through several strategic acquisitions and the divestiture of our Flooring business,\" said Celeste Mastin, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"At the same time, I am disappointed that we were unable to finish the year as strong as we had expected. In the fourth quarter, we encountered an unexpected deceleration in volume across the majority of our end markets. Furthermore, delays in customer order patterns, particularly in the consumer product goods related market segments, shifted price increase realization into fiscal 2025, delaying the offset of higher raw material costs and resulting in margin deterioration. \"We are intensely focused on what we can control and have already begun executing additional pricing actions and cost controls to prudently prepare for a challenging volume growth environment in 2025. Our strategic plan to continue to evolve H.B Fuller into a higher growth, higher margin company remains on track on the timeline we originally communicated.\" Balance Sheet and Working Capital: Net debt at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 was $1,841 million, down $48 million sequentially versus the third quarter and up $182 million year-on-year. Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 3.1X was flat versus the previous quarter. Net working capital in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 declined $56 million sequentially versus the third quarter and $46 million year-on-year. As a percentage of annualized net revenue, net working capital declined 160 basis points, both sequentially and year-on-year, to 14.5%. Manufacturing and Supply Chain Footprint Consolidation: The Company is finalizing an expanded plan to significantly reduce its global manufacturing footprint and streamline its North American planning and logistics structure. This multi-year plan is expected to reduce the number of manufacturing facilities from 82 today to a target of 55 when completed in 2030. Additionally, it will reduce the number of warehouses in North America from 55 today to approximately 10 by the end of 2027. As a result of these combined actions, the Company expects to generate approximately $75 million in annualized cost savings once the plan is fully implemented in fiscal 2030. These figures are incremental to the ongoing restructuring actions, which are still expected to generate annualized cost savings of $45 million by the end of fiscal 2025. The Company expects to invest approximately $150 million in incremental capital over the next five years associated with the expanded plan. \"Our manufacturing footprint consolidation, coupled with our planning and logistics reorganization, are important steps in our strategic plan to achieve an EBITDA margin consistently greater than 20 percent. These actions will not only reduce costs through improved capacity utilization, they will also enable us to better serve our customers and reduce future capital expenditure requirements,\" said Mastin. Fiscal 2025 Outlook: Net revenue growth for fiscal 2025 is expected to be down 2% to 4%, adjusting for the divestiture of the Flooring business, net revenue is expected to be up 1% to 2%; Organic revenue growth is expected to be flat to up 2% versus fiscal 2024; Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2025 is expected to be in the range of $600 million to $625 million, equating to growth of approximately 1% to 5% year-on-year; Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2025 is expected to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million; The core tax rate, excluding the impact of discrete items, is anticipated to be between 26% and 27% in fiscal year 2025; Net interest expense for fiscal 2025 is expected to be between $120 million and $125 million; Adjusted EPS (diluted) is expected to be in the range of $3.90 to $4.20, equating to a range of up 2% to 9% year-on-year; Operating cash flow in fiscal year 2025 is expected to be between $300 million and $325 million; Capital expenditures of approximately $160 million are expected in fiscal 2025, which includes approximately $40 million related to the Company\u2019s manufacturing footprint consolidation initiative.

2025 /CNW/ - Galiano Gold Inc. (\"Galiano\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: GAU) (NYSE American: GAU)\u00a0is pleased to provide a summary of its 2024 operational achievements, including gold production of 115,115 ounces. The Company owns a 90% interest in the Asanko Gold Mine (\"AGM\") located on the Asankrangwa Gold Belt in the Republic of Ghana , West Africa . 2024 PRODUCTION AND FULL YEAR HIGHLIGHTS (CNW Group/Galiano Gold Inc.) Highlights 1 Consolidating ownership : Completed the transaction with Gold Fields Ltd., acquiring their 45% interest in the AGM and thereby securing 90% ownership. Improved safety metrics : Achieved 12-month rolling lost-time and total recordable injury frequency rates of 0.15 and 0.58, respectively, reflecting a stronger safety performance compared to 2023. Gold production : Produced 115,115 ounces, slightly below revised guidance of 120,000 to 130,000 ounces. Full year mill throughput of 5.1 million tonnes was constrained due to harder material processed and lower mobile crushing circuit availability. Fewer ore tonnes were mined from Abore due to mining at higher elevations following an expansion of the pit to take advantage of the increased Mineral Reserve. Financial strength : Approximately $105 million in unaudited cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024 while continuing to be debt free. Life of Mine enhancements : Advanced work on the AGM's optimized Life of Mine plan and updated Mineral Reserves and Resources, with an expected release date of January 28, 2025 .

Midras South : Positive delineation drilling results at Midras South expected to result in maiden Mineral Reserve estimate in 2025. Akoma : Identified new mineralized system with encouraging initial drill test results at Akoma greenfield target, located approximately 5 kilometres (\"km\") from the AGM processing plant. Sky Gold B : Confirmed a previously unknown shear zone with multiple gold intercepts at the Sky Gold B target. Termination of offtake agreement : Ended the agreement with Red Kite Opportunities Master Fund (\"Red Kite\"), removing the obligation to sell 100% of gold production from the AGM at prices selected by Red Kite during a quotational period. Strengthened leadership : Added Navin Dyal, Dr. Moira Smith , and Lauren Roberts to the Board of Directors and appointed Michael Cardinaels as Chief Operating Officer. Story Continues \"Galiano made notable progress in 2024 in both growing production and strengthening our operating capabilities,\" said Matt Badylak , President and Chief Executive Officer of Galiano Gold Inc. \"With full ownership of the AGM secured in the first quarter, we ramped up operations at Abore and progressed solutions to address crushing and milling challenges identified earlier in the year. \"We are well-positioned to capitalize on historic high gold prices, supported by a strong financial position and the completion of the Red Kite buyout. Optimization of the Life of Mine plan remains on track, with the release of results expected later this month. Recent additions to our management team and Board of Directors further strengthen our ability to meet our goals in the year ahead.\" Exploration Updates The 2024 exploration program at the AGM was focused on increasing Mineral Reserves through delineation drilling at known deposits, as well as advancing several regional greenfields targets. Near-mine exploration : Positive delineation drilling at the Midras South deposit confirmed robust mineralization with significant widths and gold grades at shallow depths ( see Figure 1 ). Midas South is slated for Mineral Reserve inclusion in 2025.
