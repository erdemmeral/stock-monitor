Funding, Continuing U.S. Manufacturing Capacity to Strengthen America\u2019s Energy Independence Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc. Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 4:57 PM 7 min read In This Article: EOSE -2.26% EOSEW -11.45% Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc. Successfully achieves all operational milestones that guarantees final $40.5 million under $210.5 million Term Loan to further solidify position as a leader in American energy storage systems TURTLE CREEK, Pa., Jan. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ: EOSE) (\"Eos\" or the \u201cCompany\u201d), America\u2019s leading innovator in designing, manufacturing, and providing zinc-based long duration energy storage systems sourced and manufactured in the United States, today announced the successful achievement of the third set of performance milestones previously agreed upon between Eos and an affiliate of Cerberus Capital Management LP (\u201cCerberus\u201d) as part of Cerberus\u2019s strategic investment in the Company. Successfully meeting these performance milestones allowed the Company to access the final $40.5 million of the Delayed Draw Term Loan (DDTL), fueling ongoing operations, U.S. production expansion, and the creation of an American energy storage powerhouse. \u201cThe Eos team is making measurable progress, consistently meeting critical operational targets and positioning the Company for profitable growth,\u201d said Nathan Kroeker, Eos Chief Financial Officer. \u201cWith the term loan fully funded, combined with Department of Energy (DOE) loan guarantee first disbursement in December, Eos has a strong foundation and sufficient capital to continue implementing Project AMAZE. We\u2019re executing our strategy to scale production into strong customer demand for long duration energy storage. Cash from customer projects now play an important role in funding working capital and our American-made system can play a critical role in America achieving energy independence.\u201d The $210.5 million DDTL announced in June 2024 is now fully funded, driven by the Company consistently achieving key operational milestones related to the Company\u2019s state-of-the-art manufacturing line, raw materials cost-out, Z3 technology performance improvement and orders backlog cash conversion. The Company surpassed its January raw materials cost-out target by 6% while delivering manufacturing cycle times below 10 seconds to further demonstrate continued operational efficiency and progress towards profitable growth. \u201cCerberus is ecstatic about the incredible progress made since our initial investment last year. Joe and team continue to fire on all cylinders, and Cerberus will continue to be all-in, helping Eos execute on their rapidly growing global pipeline and backlog,\u201d said Nick Robinson, Cerberus Senior Managing Director and Eos Board Member. \u201cWith all the pieces now firmly in place to scale, 2025 and beyond is all about revenue growth, profitability and acceleration of global manufacturing capacity to meet exponential global demand. This demand is driven by a critical need for a long duration, non-flammable alternative to lithium at a time when the national security imperative could not be more important. With President Trump\u2019s recent Executive Order, emphasizing American-made, and American-sourced, manufacturing to supporting America\u2019s energy independence, Cerberus could not be more excited about partnering with Eos to build a large global platform. Cerberus views Eos as the \u201cFirst Solar\u201d of the battery space, further highlighting America\u2019s ability to lead, innovate, and reclaim our energy independence.\u201d Story Continues About Eos Energy Enterprises Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc. is accelerating the shift to American energy independence with positively ingenious solutions that transform how the world stores power. Our breakthrough Znyth\u2122 aqueous zinc battery was designed to overcome the limitations of conventional lithium-ion technology. It is safe, scalable, efficient, sustainable, manufactured in the U.S., and the core of our innovative systems that today provides utility, industrial, and commercial customers with a proven, reliable energy storage alternative for 3 to 12-hour applications.

What's Driving the Stock Zacks Equity Research Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 9:11 PM 3 min read In This Article: GHM -0.84% Shares of Eos Energy Enterprises EOSE hit a new 52-week high of $6.47 on Friday, before closing lower at $6.02. The EOSE stock has skyrocketed 473.3% in the past 12 months compared with the industry\u2019s 4% growth and the S&P 500\u2019s 24.7% rise. Meanwhile, the Industrial Products sector has rallied 15%. EOSE Stock\u2019s One-Year Price Performance Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research EOSE is currently trading above the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages, signaling strong upward momentum and price stability. EOSE Stock Trades Above Moving Averages Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Factors Driving Eos Energy Stock EOSE shares recently jumped on the announcement that it expects to deliver on its revised 2024 revenue guidance of $15 million supported by increased customer deliveries during the fourth quarter. The company\u2019s stated revenue levels of $15 million indicate revenues of $6.65 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. This suggests a significant improvement from $0.85 million in the third quarter of 2024. In the third quarter, the company encountered a supply-chain delivery delay in receiving new Z3 inline enclosures from a key supplier, which significantly impacted revenues. This issue has since been solved. For 2025, Eos Energy projects revenues to be between $150 million and $190 million, almost 10 times the projected 2024 level. The growth is expected to be driven by increased production volume from the company\u2019s first state-of-the-art manufacturing line, along with the continued strengthening of its overall supply chain. Over the past six months, Eos Energy has been ramping up its manufacturing line while laying a solid foundation for future growth by securing financing and adding to its customer orders backlog. Eos' annualized capacity for line one is at around 1.25 GWh currently. The company expects to take it up to the two GWh level by the fourth quarter of 2025. Also to expedite the conversion of the opportunity pipeline into orders backlog, Eos Energy launched a comprehensive insurance program in partnership with Ariel Green, a division of Ariel Re, to enhance its technology bankability. The company added that it is on track to achieve the next Cerberus milestones on Jan. 31, 2025, to unlock the next round of funding of $40.5 million. EOSE has also secured $68.3 million of funding (from the total $303.5 million loan guarantee) from the Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office in December 2024. The loan advance covers both capital expenditures and project-associated operating expenses incurred as part of the company's production expansion plans related to Project AMAZE in the Mon Valley Works. Story Continues These funds support Eos\u2019 ongoing efforts to boost its operational capacity and further its strategic growth objectives.

Pursuing a Public Market Turnaround of U.S. Steel \u2013 Not Trying to Solicit Alternative Bids and Sell the Company CLEVELAND, January 27, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Ancora Holdings Group, LLC (collectively with its affiliates, \"Ancora\" or \"we\"), a diversified investment firm that oversees approximately $10 billion in assets, today issued the below open letter to the Board of Directors (the \"Board\") of United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) (\"U.S. Steel\" or the \"Company\") regarding a variety of issues, including the Company\u2019s recently blocked sale to Nippon Steel Corporation (\"Nippon\"). To receive important updates, visit www.MakeUSSteelGreatAgain.com . *** January 27, 2025 United States Steel Corporation 600 Grant Street Pittsburgh, PA 15219 Attn: The Board Dear Members of the Board, Ancora is a growing shareholder of U.S. Steel. As an investment firm with deep roots in the Midwest, we have an affinity for the industrial and logistics companies that collectively form the backbone of America\u2019s economy. We are proud to be investors in companies such as Berry Global Group, Inc., Norfolk Southern Corporation, RB Global, Inc. and now U.S. Steel. Owning these types of businesses enables us to pursue strong risk-adjusted returns while helping support American competitiveness, job creation and wage growth. Although we understand why the Board explored strategic alternatives in 2023, its ultimate decision to ignore national security and pursue a risky sale to Nippon \u2013 an overseas bidder that came in just $1 per share higher than a competing domestic bidder \u2013 has led to a dead end. There appears to be no legal basis and no precedent for U.S. Steel\u2019s costly litigation over the Presidential Executive Order blocking the transaction. Moreover, President Donald Trump is a vocal opponent of the deal and long-term proponent of strengthening America\u2019s domestic manufacturing base. He also has long-held skepticism about foreign direct investment from Japan based on his own business dealings dating back to the 1980s. We see no reason to believe that President Trump, a high-conviction businessman who was elected by middle-class and working-class voters, is going to contradict his self-described \"America First\" agenda and disregard the opposition of the United Steelworkers. Story Continues The Board\u2019s choice to double down on its extremely poor decision to pursue a sale to Nippon has also kept U.S. Steel in a corroded state. Chief Executive Officer David Burritt, who stood to rake in more than $70 million himself if the sale had been consummated, has been allowed to misallocate capital, issue unreliable and overoptimistic forecasts, and repeatedly miss financial targets. It seems the Board failed to keep Mr. Burritt\u2019s attention on efficiency, execution and risk management as steel prices remained depressed over the past year. Rather than finally acknowledge the Company\u2019s perilous trajectory and try to course correct, the Board remains steadfastly committed to an underperforming leader who apparently lacks the ability and vision to bring U.S. Steel back from a busted transaction. In light of these alarming decisions and the unjustifiable deference to Mr. Burritt, who has made clear through outlandish rhetoric that he is self-interested and unfit for leadership, Ancora has nominated nine highly qualified, independent candidates for election to the Board at U.S. Steel\u2019s 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Our slate includes individuals with corporate governance experience, finance expertise, industrials and manufacturing backgrounds, public policy acumen and other qualifications critical to turning around a standalone U.S. Steel. The slate\u2019s plan includes installing Alan Kestenbaum, a steel industry legend who delivered total shareholder returns of more than 450% at Stelco Holdings Inc., as a replacement for Mr. Burritt. We expect the investment community will agree that any steel company would be fortunate to have Mr. Kestenbaum assume such a role. Our slate and Mr. Kestenbaum look forward to ultimately releasing their full plan for enhancing U.S. Steel\u2019s corporate governance, cost structure, labor relations, margins, operations and long-term viability as a force within the American economy. With the tailwind of President Trump\u2019s agenda, including steel tariffs, our nominees are confident they will shift the Company\u2019s strategy from hoping to be saved to implementing a multi-year plan that targets meaningful share price appreciation. The Case for Wholesale Change: The Board Has Doubled Down on its Bad Decision to Pursue a Risky Sale \u2013 Even After the Sale was Blocked by Executive Order We want to take this opportunity to share a few key facts. First and foremost, no transaction blocked by Presidential Executive Order after a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has ever gone through. This means there is no legal precedent for the litigation brought by U.S. Steel and Nippon earlier this month. Although U.S. Steel seems to be holding out hope that it can convince President Trump to approve the deal, the facts indicate that this is a pipe dream. President Trump has repeatedly voiced opposition to the transaction and has long been skeptical of deals with Japanese businesses. 1 In fact, just last month he stated \"I am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company, in this case Nippon Steel of Japan [\u2026] As President, I will block this deal from happening.\" 2 Nothing he has said since former President Joseph Biden\u2019s Executive Order indicates a change of heart. In addition to the aforementioned headwinds, the blocked deal also faced opposition from Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a bipartisan contingent of high-profile lawmakers and the United Steelworkers. When they were in the Senate, Messrs. Vance and Rubio previously co-authored a letter to then-Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen to stress that \"[t]he transaction was not entered into with U.S. national security in mind.\" 3 It should be clear as day that U.S. Steel is now fighting a binding Executive Order, the Trump administration, an array of senators and representatives, and a multitude of third parties that do not buy into Mr. Burritt\u2019s self-serving arguments. The Board should also be aware of what independent and objective legal experts have to say: \"Unfortunately for Nippon Steel, their argument is not particularly strong. The president's action in this case is explicitly excluded from judicial review under U.S. law.\" - Akira Inoue, partner, Baker & McKenzie 4 \"The D.C. Circuit is unlikely to overturn the blocking order based solely on allegations of pre-determination or the appearance of a sham process. Substantial evidence of constitutional violations or procedural defects is normally required. In addition, there does not appear to be a process for taking evidence, so the sham argument cannot be developed beyond what is in the public record.\" - Ken Nunnenkamp, partner, Morgan Lewis 5 \"Nippon and U.S. Steel face a formidable uphill battle in challenging CFIUS' referral and the president's exercise of authority to block the deal on national security grounds. Congress intended to shield CFIUS' decisions, and the president's conclusions under the CFIUS regime, from virtually all judicial review, an approach that is consistent with broad judicial deference to the executive branch on national security matters.\" - Mario Mancuso, George W. Hicks Jr. and Lucille Hague, partners, Kirkland & Ellis 6 It borders on delusional to think that the Trump administration would use precious political capital at the start of its term to reverse its public position on the transaction, not to mention undermine its clearly articulated focus on revitalizing American manufacturing and insourcing. The Case for Wholesale Change: The Board Has Allowed a Conflicted, Underperforming CEO to Hinder U.S. Steel\u2019s Credibility and Undermine the Company\u2019s Future Ancora has a proven track record of correctly identifying companies that are held back by conflicted or unfit CEOs. Before we seek the removal of a CEO, we typically try to work with a board of directors to address and course correct the executive\u2019s shortcomings. In this case, however, we see no future with Mr. Burritt. In our view, Mr. Burritt exhibited disqualifying behavior on January 3 rd , when he issued a statement that called former President Biden\u2019s decision \"shameful and corrupt . \" He continued what appeared to be a tirade by calling highly respected United Steelworkers President David McCall a \" union boss,\" effectively questioning his integrity. 7 We also need to scrutinize the Board\u2019s oversight of Mr. Burritt in light of his public accusation that the prior administration made a decision that supports the Chinese Communist Party. It runs counter to the interests of shareholders, to which Mr. Burritt owes a fiduciary duty, to make seemingly unhinged and retaliatory statements about plans \"to fight President Biden\u2019s political corruption.\" 8 Regardless of political leanings, this is not how standard public company executives act. Perhaps this is why Jeh Johnson, former Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, abruptly resigned from the Board in recent weeks. Since before the sale to Nippon was announced, Mr. Burritt also appears to have diverted his focus from U.S. Steel\u2019s operations. For example, on the conference call for the Nippon sale announcement, analysts noted that Big River\u2019s EBITDA per ton was down roughly 59% and the mini-mill cost per ton was up roughly 23% following the 2021 Big River acquisition. 9 Mr. Burritt\u2019s response to this was tone deaf: \"we feel absolutely wonderful about this Big River facility. And with Big River 2, it's going to be even more remarkable.\" 10 When U.S. Steel reported fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings only six weeks later, it revealed $12 million of costs related to Big River, which had the effect of reducing the mini-mill segment\u2019s EBITDA to just $74 million. 11 Unfortunately for shareholders, the trend of excess costs at Big River has continued unabated. On September 19, 2024, the Company disclosed that the mini-mill segment\u2019s adjusted EBITDA would be lower than the previous quarter, impacted by $40 million of costs from the Big River 2 mini-mill. 12 The Company followed this with a vague cautionary note on December 19, 2024, stating Big River 2 \"ramp-related costs exert pressure on the quarter.\" 13 In addition to unrelenting Big River cost overruns, U.S. Steel has consistently missed earnings estimates over the past year and a half while lagging its peers. Notably, during Mr. Burritt\u2019s tenure, the Company\u2019s total shareholder returns have underperformed peers by a staggering 227.7%. Total Shareholder Returns* 1-year 5-year Burritt CEO Tenure U.S. Steel -7.7% -21.3% 13.5% Peer Median 24.9% 180.6% 241.2% Relative Performance -32.2% -201.9% -227.7% Source: FactSet and Bloomberg. Peers include Commercial Metals Company, Cleveland-Cliffs Inc., Reliance, Inc., Steel Dynamics, Inc. and Nucor Corporation. *Total shareholder returns as of market close August 11, 2023, the last trading day prior to the Company\u2019s disclosure of initiating a strategic alternatives process. Mr. Burritt\u2019s election by the Board to assume the CEO role was announced May 10, 2017. Key Performance Metrics** Revenue Growth Adjusted EBITDA Growth CapEx Growth Free Cash Flow Growth U.S. Steel 19.7% -25.6% 336.6%*** -225.7% Peer Median 38.3% 15.5% 79.2% 55.0% Relative Performance -18.6% -41.1% 257.4% -280.7% **Key performance metrics measured from figures reported by U.S. Steel and peers from Q2 2021 to Q3 2024. These dates reflect the start of the economic recovery from COVID and the most recently reported quarter. ***CapEx Growth is based on incurred expenses and likely does not yet reflect U.S. Steel's $600 million budget expansion for Big River 2. U.S. Steel is now in a dire state due to its excessive capital spending, high debt, soft earnings and nonexistent contingency plan. While Mr. Burritt may not care due to what seem to be his jet-setting ways, we believe the city of Pittsburgh and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have been put at economic risk by his sale aspirations and mismanagement of the Company. There are consequences associated with having out-of-touch leadership with weak involvement in local communities. Absent a miracle, Ancora believes a substantial and urgent reconstitution of the Company\u2019s leadership is necessary. An Alternative Path Forward: Our Slate and Mr. Kestenbaum Want to Make U.S. Steel Great Again in the Public Market Ancora has nominated a fit-for-purpose slate with nine highly qualified individuals, whose complementary skills make them greater than the sum of their parts. Each is a leader in his or her respective field and is able to draw on prior public company experience to help set a viable go-forward strategy. Our nominees include individuals with experience in corporate governance, executive leadership, finance, logistics, manufacturing, regulatory affairs and strategic transactions. They come to the Board free of the incumbents\u2019 past mistakes, open-minded, and committed to producing enduring value for shareholders and stakeholders. Importantly, the slate includes industry heavyweight Alan Kestenbaum, the former Chairman and CEO of Stelco, as a CEO candidate for U.S. Steel. If our slate\u2019s campaign is successful, Mr. Kestenbaum will bring to the role a uniquely close relationship with the United Steelworkers, expertise in identifying and operating undervalued assets, and an unrelenting commitment to delivering the best possible results. Most notably, Mr. Kestenbaum has a history of turning U.S. Steel\u2019s failed endeavors into home runs. Look no further than what he accomplished at Stelco, a company U.S. Steel put into bankruptcy. Mr. Kestenbaum acquired Stelco for approximately $53 million, only to later sell it for more than $2 billion. 14 In the process, he enriched his shareholders through the success of a turnaround, whereas U.S. Steel\u2019s investors received virtually nothing for the asset. Considering the significant underperformance of U.S. Steel\u2019s operations and Mr. Burritt\u2019s underwhelming results as a leader, Mr. Kestenbaum represents a massive upgrade on all fronts. If elected, our slate and its CEO candidate are committed to the following: Pursuing the $565 million breakup fee that U.S. Steel needs based on Mr. Burritt\u2019s own statements regarding the prospect of potential facility closures and layoffs. Immediately ending the current Board\u2019s spending spree on Wall Street advisors, which we estimate to be a nine-figure sum over the past 18 months. Revamping the executive leadership team to be full of operators residing near facilities and plants. Restoring relations with labor union members and leaders, community organizations and elected officials. Releasing a clear standalone strategy so investors have transparency about priorities for capital allocation, operations and production, and other commercial initiatives. Protecting Mon Valley Works and other facilities Mr. Burritt has threatened to close. It\u2019s important to highlight that Mr. Kestenbaum\u2019s track record as a CEO includes increasing employment everywhere he has been. Not soliciting acquisition proposals from Cleveland-Cliffs, Inc. or any other partner (domestic or foreign). Please note that despite the sale to Nippon being blocked this month, you \u2013 the Board \u2013 decided to keep a January deadline for director candidate nominations in an apparent effort to insulate yourselves. We complied with your deadline despite being in the process of amassing a meaningful stake that will be disclosed in due course. Make no mistake, Ancora, as well as Mr. Kestenbaum, intend to build meaningful positions as sale pipe dreams fade and the Company\u2019s share price continues resetting from what have been artificially inflated levels. In closing, our goal here is straightforward: make U.S. Steel great again for the benefit of employees, customers, shareholders and all other stakeholders who want a bright future for this American icon. Only under a new Board and management team do we believe this is possible. Regards, Fredrick D.

Industry: Industrial Services Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2401215/4-industrial-services-stocks-to-watch-despite-industry-headwinds The Zacks Industrial Services industry has been bearing the brunt of the prolonged contraction in the manufacturing sector as customers remain cautious about spending. Flared-up input costs have added to the woes. Despite the current setback, the rise in e-commerce activities will be a key catalyst for the industry. Companies like W.W. Grainger, Inc. , Eos Energy Enterprises , ScanSource and ClearSign Technologies are positioned for growth by leveraging strategies to capitalize on this demand. The companies have also been focusing on lowering costs, increasing productivity and efficiency, and investing in automation and digitization, which will aid growth. Industry Description The Zacks Industrial Services industry comprises companies that provide industrial equipment products and MRO (maintenance, repair and operations) services. It includes routine maintenance, emergency maintenance and spare part inventory control, which keep a facility and its equipment in good operating condition. Industry participants serve a wide array of customers, ranging from commercial, government and healthcare to manufacturing. The industry's products (power tools, hand tools, cutting fluids, lubricants, personal protective equipment and consumables) are utilized in production and plant maintenance but are not directly related to customers\u2019 core products or services. These companies reduce MRO supply-chain costs and improve customers' plant floor productivity by offering inventory management, and process and procurement solutions. Trends Shaping the Future of the Industrial Services Industry Extended Downturn in Manufacturing Activity is Concerning : The manufacturing sector contributes around 70% to the industry's revenues. Customer activity trends are historically correlated to changes in the Industrial Production Index. Per the Federal Reserve\u2019s last update, industrial production was up a meager 0.5% in the 12 months ended December 2024. The durable goods manufacturing index was up 0.1% during the period. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index had languished in contraction territory for a consecutive 16 months until February 2024. March saw a slight uptick to 50.3%. However, the index slipped to the contraction territory again, with a 49.2% reading in April. It has remained below 50% since and was 49.3% in December. The average for 2024 was 48.3%. Story continues The New Orders Index had shown expansion in November and December, following seven consecutive months of contraction. However, it remains to be seen whether this will be sustained as the index has not delivered consistent growth since the end of its 24-month expansion streak in May 2022. Once the situation normalizes, strong demand in the diverse end markets will drive the industry\u2019s growth. Pricing Actions to Combat High Costs : The industry has been experiencing significant inflation levels, including higher prices for labor, freight and fuel. The companies are witnessing labor shortages for some positions and incurring steep labor costs to meet demand. Industry players are focusing on pricing actions, cost-cutting measures, efforts to improve productivity and efficiency and the diversification of the supplier base to mitigate some of these headwinds. E-commerce to be a Growth Driver : MRO demand is significantly impacted by the evolution of e-commerce. Customer demand for highly tailored solutions, with real-time access to information and rapid delivery of products, is rising. Customers want to execute their business activities in the most efficient way possible, which often means online. According to Statista, global e-commerce revenues are expected to reach $4,791 billion in 2025 and see a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.83% between 2025 and 2029. The U.S. retail e-commerce market is expected to reach the $1.38 trillion mark in 2025 and witness a CAGR of 8.01% between 2025 and 2029. To capitalize on this trend, industrial service companies are heavily investing in improving their digital capabilities and increasing their e-commerce share.

Four Industrial Services Stocks to Keep an Eye On Eos Energy Enterprises : The company recently announced that it is set to deliver on its revised 2024 revenue guidance of $15 million supported by increased customer deliveries during the fourth quarter. For 2025, it projects revenues to be between $150 million and $190 million, almost 10 times the projected 2024 level. The growth is expected to be driven by increased production from its first state-of-the-art manufacturing line along with the continued strengthening of its overall supply chain. Over the past six months, Eos Energy has been ramping up its manufacturing line while laying a solid foundation for future growth by securing financing and adding to its customer orders backlog. EOS\u2019 annualized capacity for line one is around 1.25 GWh currently. The company expects to take it up to the two GWh level by the fourth quarter of 2025.

The company recently expanded its partnership with Zeeco, Inc. to launch a co-branded process burner line. This collaborative effort by ClearSign Technologies and Zeeco is expected to significantly reduce industrial emissions. The company had reported record revenues in the third quarter of 2024. The growing pipeline of projects to be shipped, installed and in engineering phases and its expanding sales channels through a network of partners, OEM and engineering firms poised the company well for solid growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tulsa, OK-based ClearSign Technologies\u2019 earnings for fiscal 2025 has been unchanged over the past 30 days.

GWW is well-poised to gain from efforts to increase its customer base through incremental marketing investments and effective marketing strategies. The High Touch Solutions North America segment will continue to benefit from pricing actions and volume growth. The Endless Assortment segment is gaining from customer acquisitions at its Zoro and MonotaRO businesses. Cost-control measures undertaken by GWW will sustain margins. The company is also focused on improving the end-to-end customer experience by investing in its e-commerce and digital capabilities and executing improvement initiatives within its supply chain. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings for the Lake Forest, IL-based company indicates year-over-year growth of 7.6%. The estimate has remained unchanged over the past 30 days. GWW currently has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.24%, on average. It has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 9.3% and a Zacks Rank of 3 at present. ScanSource : Despite cautious technology spending hurting its revenues, the company\u2019s shifting business mix, operational execution and cost-saving efforts are driving stronger earnings and cash flow. Efforts to lower debt while returning capital to shareholders and acquisitions are also commendable. ScanSource recently acquired Resourcive, which delivers strategic IT sourcing solutions to the mid-market and enterprise, advising clients on value creation strategies that are enabled by technology. With this acquisition, ScanSource is creating the advisory channel model of the future. SCSC has also acquired Advantix, which enables mobility value-added resellers to sell hardware combined with the recurring revenue stream from data connectivity.

Despite Industry Headwinds Madhurima Das Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 7:10 PM 8 min read In This Article: SCSC -3.61% ^GSPC -0.76% GWW -1.50% The Zacks Industrial Services industry has been bearing the brunt of the prolonged contraction in the manufacturing sector as customers remain cautious about spending. Flared-up input costs have added to the woes. Despite the current setback, the rise in e-commerce activities will be a key catalyst for the industry. Companies like W.W. Grainger, Inc. GWW, Eos Energy Enterprises EOSE, ScanSource SCSC and ClearSign Technologies CLIR are positioned for growth by leveraging strategies to capitalize on this demand. The companies have also been focusing on lowering costs, increasing productivity and efficiency, and investing in automation and digitization, which will aid growth. Industry Description The Zacks Industrial Services industry comprises companies that provide industrial equipment products and MRO (maintenance, repair and operations) services. It includes routine maintenance, emergency maintenance and spare part inventory control, which keep a facility and its equipment in good operating condition. Industry participants serve a wide array of customers, ranging from commercial, government and healthcare to manufacturing. The industry's products (power tools, hand tools, cutting fluids, lubricants, personal protective equipment and consumables) are utilized in production and plant maintenance but are not directly related to customers\u2019 core products or services. These companies reduce MRO supply-chain costs and improve customers' plant floor productivity by offering inventory management, and process and procurement solutions. Trends Shaping the Future of the Industrial Services Industry Extended Downturn in Manufacturing Activity is Concerning : The manufacturing sector contributes around 70% to the industry's revenues. Customer activity trends are historically correlated to changes in the Industrial Production Index. Per the Federal Reserve\u2019s last update, industrial production was up a meager 0.5% in the 12 months ended December 2024. The durable goods manufacturing index was up 0.1% during the period. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index had languished in contraction territory for a consecutive 16 months until February 2024. March saw a slight uptick to 50.3%. However, the index slipped to the contraction territory again, with a 49.2% reading in April. It has remained below 50% since and was 49.3% in December. The average for 2024 was 48.3%. The New Orders Index had shown expansion in November and December, following seven consecutive months of contraction. However, it remains to be seen whether this will be sustained as the index has not delivered consistent growth since the end of its 24-month expansion streak in May 2022. Once the situation normalizes, strong demand in the diverse end markets will drive the industry\u2019s growth. Pricing Actions to Combat High Costs : The industry has been experiencing significant inflation levels, including higher prices for labor, freight and fuel. The companies are witnessing labor shortages for some positions and incurring steep labor costs to meet demand. Industry players are focusing on pricing actions, cost-cutting measures, efforts to improve productivity and efficiency and the diversification of the supplier base to mitigate some of these headwinds. E-commerce to be a Growth Driver : MRO demand is significantly impacted by the evolution of e-commerce. Customer demand for highly tailored solutions, with real-time access to information and rapid delivery of products, is rising. Customers want to execute their business activities in the most efficient way possible, which often means online. According to Statista, global e-commerce revenues are expected to reach $4,791 billion in 2025 and see a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.83% between 2025 and 2029. The U.S. retail e-commerce market is expected to reach the $1.38 trillion mark in 2025 and witness a CAGR of 8.01% between 2025 and 2029. To capitalize on this trend, industrial service companies are heavily investing in improving their digital capabilities and increasing their e-commerce share.

Four Industrial Services Stocks to Keep an Eye on Eos Energy Enterprises : The company recently announced that it is set to deliver on its revised 2024 revenue guidance of $15 million supported by increased customer deliveries during the fourth quarter. For 2025, it projects revenues to be between $150 million and $190 million, almost 10 times the projected 2024 level. The growth is expected to be driven by increased production from its first state-of-the-art manufacturing line along with the continued strengthening of its overall supply chain. Over the past six months, Eos Energy has been ramping up its manufacturing line while laying a solid foundation for future growth by securing financing and adding to its customer orders backlog. EOS\u2019 annualized capacity for line one is around 1.25 GWh currently. The company expects to take it up to the two GWh level by the fourth quarter of 2025.

Price & Consensus: EOSE ClearSign Technologies : The company, in December 2024, announced that it had received the follow-on purchase order to retrofit four process heaters with 26 ClearSign Core burners. This marks a milestone for CLIR, as it is the largest order in terms of the number of burners and total order value. The company recently expanded its partnership with Zeeco, Inc. to launch a co-branded process burner line. This collaborative effort by ClearSign Technologies and Zeeco is expected to significantly reduce industrial emissions. The company had reported record revenues in the third quarter of 2024. The growing pipeline of projects to be shipped, installed and in engineering phases and its expanding sales channels through a network of partners, OEM and engineering firms poise the company well for solid growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tulsa, OK-based ClearSign Technologies\u2019 earnings for fiscal 2025 has been unchanged over the past 30 days. The estimate currently indicates year-over-year growth of 107.7%. CLIR has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 20.83%, on average. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Price & Consensus: CLIR Grainger : The company continues to deliver robust results, aided by margin improvements in its segments and strong operating performance. GWW is well-poised to gain from efforts to increase its customer base through incremental marketing investments and effective marketing strategies. The High Touch Solutions North America segment will continue to benefit from pricing actions and volume growth. The Endless Assortment segment is gaining from customer acquisitions at its Zoro and MonotaRO businesses. Cost-control measures undertaken by GWW will sustain margins. The company is also focused on improving the end-to-end customer experience by investing in its e-commerce and digital capabilities and executing improvement initiatives within its supply chain. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings for the Lake Forest, IL-based company indicates year-over-year growth of 7.6%. The estimate has remained unchanged over the past 30 days.

Price & Consensus: GWW ScanSource : Despite cautious technology spending hurting its revenues, the company\u2019s shifting business mix, operational execution and cost-saving efforts are driving stronger earnings and cash flow. Efforts to lower debt while returning capital to shareholders and acquisitions are also commendable. ScanSource recently acquired Resourcive, which delivers strategic IT sourcing solutions to the mid-market and enterprise, advising clients on value creation strategies that are enabled by technology. With this acquisition, ScanSource is creating the advisory channel model of the future.

18.5%: Is This an Indication of Further Gains? Zacks Equity Research Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 4:37 PM 2 min read In This Article: GWW -1.50% Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc. (EOSE) shares ended the last trading session 18.5% higher at $6.16. The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 28.7% gain over the past four weeks. EOSE shares jumped on the company\u2019s announcement that it expects to deliver on its revised 2024 revenue guidance of $15 million supported by increased customer deliveries during the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, the company encountered a supply-chain delivery delay in receiving new Z3 inline enclosures from a key supplier, which had significantly impacted revenues. This issue has been solved. For 2025, Eos Energy projects revenues to be between $150 million and $190 million, almost 10 times the 2024 level. This company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.26 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -62.5%. Revenues are expected to be $6.25 million, down 5.5% from the year-ago quarter. While earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. For Eos Energy Enterprises, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.

Sell This Energy Stock? Nauman khan Mon, Jan 20, 2025, 1:43 PM 1 min read In this article: EOSE -2.26% EOSEW -11.45% One of the pioneering players in zinc-based long-duration storage energy systems, Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc. ( EOSE , Financial ), has experienced a more than 470% surge in its stock price in the past 52-weeks due to the strong demand for energy solutions. Global Player said it met its revised 2024 revenue guidance of $15 million as its supply chain efficiencies and customer deliveries improved. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with EOSE. Up 470% Over 52 Weeks: Should You Buy or Sell This Energy Stock? Eos looks forward to continuing to grow its revenue at 10x as of today, which Eos estimates will reach $150 million to $190 million in 2025 from expanded production capacity and improved supply chain. CEO Joe Mastrangelo pointed to further ramp-up of the company's advanced manufacturing line as well as continuing efforts to secure critical financing and order customer expansion. Eos also created an insurance program with Ariel Green that features performance guarantees and investment tax credit protection to increase bankability. However, these initiatives were highlighted by CFO Nathan Kroeker as they increase operational reliability and economic return for customers, explained Kroeker. Cerberus is on pace to unlock further funding for the company by January 31, 2025, under Cerberus milestones, to land that money, which will continue to propel Solana forward. We expect to report full-year 2024 results in March. Overall, analysts are a bit too cautiously optimistic about Eos Energy, given a consensus \"outperform\" rating. The stock's current 52-week high of $6 is in stark contrast to the mean price target of $5.3 that analysts have set, suggesting room for skepticism about valuation if the company continues on its promising growth track.
