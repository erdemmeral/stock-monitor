The consensus estimate for quarterly earnings has been stable over the past 30 days at 47 cents per share and indicates an increase of 6.8% from the year-earlier quarter\u2019s tally.

Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar . Factors Likely to Influence LEVI\u2019s Q4 Results Levi Strauss\u2019 quarterly performance is likely to have benefited from omnichannel initiatives and brand strength, including jeanswear. The company has been strengthening its omni capabilities including Buy Online, Pick-up in Store, line-queuing, same-day delivery, mobile checkout and return capabilities, including contactless returns. LEVI has been focused on elevating brands, investing in digital tools and capabilities and pacing up efforts to diversify across geographies, product categories and distribution channels. As part of its ongoing global productivity effort, Project Fuel, the company is on track to transition from a mainly owned-and-operated distribution and logistics network in the United States and Europe to a balanced owned and third-party logistics provider. Such strengths, along with its solid direct-to-consumer business, are likely to have bolstered the quarterly performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is currently pegged at $936 million for Americas, $427 million for Europe and $262 million for Asia, indicating respective increases of 5.4%, 12.7%, and flat year over year. However, a challenging operating backdrop, including supply-chain disruptions, inflationary pressures and foreign currency translations, is likely to have been a concern. These headwinds, coupled with deleveraged selling, general and administrative costs, are expected to have somewhat weighed on the company\u2019s profitability.

Trump's tariffs American Eagle Gains 11% Post Strong Holiday Results: Buy Now or Wait? Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 7:04 PM 5 min read In This Article: AEO -3.97% ANF -3.21% DECK -3.79% Shares of American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. AEO have risen 11.3% after it reported robust comparable sales (comps) from the start of the fourth quarter fiscal 2024\u00a0 through Jan. 4, 2025, which increased in the low-single digits, ahead of its outlook of 1% growth. The company benefited from positive trends across American Eagle and Aerie brands during the holiday season. AEO witnessed record sales in December, benefiting from great product assortments and engaging customer experiences. As a result, management raised its view for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The company\u2019s share growth of 11.3% since Jan. 13, 2025, contrasts with the broader industry\u2019s growth of 2.8%, and the Retail-Wholesale sector and the S&P 500\u2019s rallies of\u00a0 2.7% each. AEO Stock\u2019s Price Performance Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research AEO\u2019s Raised Q4 View American Eagle is benefiting from its digital endeavors and other robust strategies, including the Powering Profitable Growth Plan. The company is gaining from brand strength and solid demand for its products that resonate well with customers. Management envisions a fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 operating profit of $135 million, up from the earlier mentioned $125-$130 million. This is based on comps growth of about 2% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, whereas it reported an 8% rise in the prior year. Backed by a continued focus on maintaining operational efficiencies, the company is on track to deliver high-teens operating profit growth in fiscal 2024. AEO bought back 1.5 million shares for $27 million in the fiscal fourth quarter through Jan. 4, bringing total fiscal year-to-date repurchases to 7.5 million shares for $158 million. Following this, the company has 22.5 million shares available for repurchase under its current authorization. It has returned $231 million in cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases so far in fiscal 2024. American Eagle\u2019s Estimate Revision Trend Reflecting the upgraded view, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has seen upward revisions. In the past seven days, analysts have increased their estimates for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 by a penny each to 49 cents and $1.70 per share, respectively. Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar. AEO\u2019s Discounted Valuation American Eagle\u2019s current valuation suggests that the stock is available at a discounted price compared with the industry average. The AEO stock trades at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 9.6X, significantly lower than the Zacks Retail \u2013 Apparel and Shoes industry average of 18.9X and the S&P 500\u2019s average of 22.31X. Story Continues Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Is AEO\u2019s One-Year Performance as Impressive? While the AEO stock has rebounded after the holiday results, its one-year stock performance is not as impressive. The stock has declined 14.2% in the past year against the industry\u2019s growth of 40.9% and the sector\u2019s rally of 30.5%. It has also surpassed the S&P 500\u2019s growth of 24.3%. At the current price of $17.24, the American Eagle stock reflects a 34.8% discount from its 52-week high mark of $26.44. This indicates that the stock has upside potential. American Eagle has been witnessing cautiousness about challenges from retail calendar shifts, increased markdowns and a tough macro landscape, including evolving consumer spending patterns. American Eagle has been grappling with soft margins for a while due to increased markdowns. Impacts from the retail calendar shift are expected to hurt the company\u2019s overall revenues, reflecting an $85-million impact in the fourth quarter and $60 million in fiscal 2024. In addition, stiff competition in the industry is concerning. How to Play the American Eagle Stock? Reflecting the near-term headwinds from softer earnings and muted guidance raises concerns about the AEO stock's near-term growth potential. While its long-term strategies provide a foundation for recovery, concerns around a declining gross margin, elevated promotional activities and reduced earnings forecasts suggest caution. For now, investors may want to wait for signs of stabilization in earnings and margin trends before considering a position in AEO. American Eagle currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

Guidance on Strong Holiday Sales Zacks Equity Research Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 7:38 PM 3 min read In This Article: AEO -3.97% BOOT -9.53% DECK -3.79% American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. AEO is benefiting from its digital endeavors and other robust strategies, including the Powering Profitable Growth Plan. The company is gaining from brand strength and solid demand for its products that resonate well with customers. Buoyed by such tailwinds, management has announced sturdy holiday results. AEO witnessed record sales in December, benefiting from great product assortments and engaging customer experiences. Management raised its view for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 on robust trends seen across brands and holiday results. A Glance at AEO\u2019s Raised View & Other Data The company said that fourth quarter-to-date comparable sales (comps) through Jan. 4, 2025, increased in low-single digits, well ahead of the recent outlook of being positive 1%. We note that the trends across American Eagle and Aerie remained positive. Management now envisions fourth-quarter operating profit to be nearly $135 million, up from the earlier guidance of $125-$130 million. This is based on a comps rise of about 2% for the final quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with the 8% rise in the prior year. Fourth quarter-to-date, AEO bought back 1.5 million shares for $27 million, bringing total repurchases to 7.5 million shares for $158 million. The company still had 22.5 million shares available for repurchase under its current authorization. Hence, the company has returned $231 million in cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases for the year-to-date period. What\u2019s More? Despite record sales in December and a raised fourth-quarter view, shares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company fell nearly 5% yesterday. Shares of this apparel and footwear dealer have lost 25.9% against the industry\u2019s 11.1% growth in the three-month time frame. We note that investors remain cautious about challenges from retail calendar shifts, increased markdowns and a tough macro landscape, including evolving consumer spending patterns. American Eagle has been grappling with soft margins for a while owing to increased markdowns. Impacts from the retail calendar shift will hurt the company\u2019s overall revenues, which will decline approximately 5%. In the fourth quarter, this is likely to impact revenues to the tune of $85 million and $60 million in fiscal 2024. Although the comps outlook surpassed the previous view for the fiscal fourth quarter, it still indicates a sharp decline from 8% growth witnessed in the same period the prior year.

(AEO) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 5:00 PM 5 min read In This Article: AEO -3.97% American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future. Shares of this teen clothing retailer have returned -7.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.5% change. The Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry, to which American Eagle belongs, has lost 2.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Earnings Estimate Revisions Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, American Eagle is expected to post earnings of $0.48 per share, indicating a change of -21.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.3% over the last 30 days. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.68 points to a change of +10.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.4%. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.80 indicates a change of +7.2% from what American Eagle is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.6%. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for American Eagle. Story Continues The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: 12 Month EPS Revenue Growth Forecast Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial. For American Eagle, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $1.61 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $5.34 billion and $5.52 billion estimates indicate +1.4% and +3.5% changes, respectively. Last Reported Results and Surprise History American Eagle reported revenues of $1.29 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.9%. EPS of $0.48 for the same period compares with $0.49 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.3 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.19%. The EPS surprise was +4.35%. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period. Valuation Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects. While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price. The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. American Eagle is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. Conclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about American Eagle. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Trump's tariffs American Eagle (AEO): Buy, Sell, or Hold Post Q3 Earnings? Adam Hejl Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 12:02 PM 3 min read In This Article: AEO -3.97% American Eagle (AEO): Buy, Sell, or Hold Post Q3 Earnings? American Eagle has gotten torched over the last six months - since July 2024, its stock price has dropped 23.5% to $15.68 per share. This was partly driven by its softer quarterly results and might have investors contemplating their next move. Is there a buying opportunity in American Eagle, or does it present a risk to your portfolio? Get the full stock story straight from our expert analysts, it\u2019s free . Even though the stock has become cheaper, we're swiping left on American Eagle for now. Here are three reasons why we avoid AEO and a stock we'd rather own. Why Is American Eagle Not Exciting? With a heavy focus on denim, American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE:AEO) is a specialty retailer offering an assortment of apparel and accessories to young adults. 1. Long-Term Revenue Growth Disappoints A company\u2019s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Unfortunately, American Eagle\u2019s 5% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was sluggish. This fell short of our benchmark for the consumer retail sector. American Eagle Quarterly Revenue 2. Free Cash Flow Margin Dropping If you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills. As you can see below, American Eagle\u2019s margin dropped by 7.9 percentage points over the last year. This decrease came from the higher costs associated with opening more stores. American Eagle Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin 3. Previous Growth Initiatives Haven\u2019t Paid Off Yet Growth gives us insight into a company\u2019s long-term potential, but how capital-efficient was that growth? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity). American Eagle historically did a mediocre job investing in profitable growth initiatives. Its five-year average ROIC was 4.2%, lower than the typical cost of capital (how much it costs to raise money) for consumer retail companies. Final Judgment American Eagle isn\u2019t a terrible business, but it doesn\u2019t pass our quality test. Following the recent decline, the stock trades at 8.4\u00d7 forward price-to-earnings (or $15.68 per share). While this valuation is optically cheap, the potential downside is big given its shaky fundamentals. We're pretty confident there are superior stocks to buy right now. We\u2019d recommend looking at Wabtec, a leading provider of locomotive services benefiting from an upgrade cycle . Stocks We Would Buy Instead of American Eagle With rates dropping, inflation stabilizing, and the elections in the rearview mirror, all signs point to the start of a new bull run - and we\u2019re laser-focused on finding the best stocks for this upcoming cycle.
