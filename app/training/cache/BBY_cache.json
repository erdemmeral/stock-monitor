[{"text": "LIVE The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon offers surprising take on tariffs Patricia Battle Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 6:07 PM 3 min read Last year, then-President-elect Donald Trump touted a major plan during his campaign trail to impose tariffs, which are taxes companies pay to import goods from overseas, as soon as he takes office as president. At the time, he specifically vowed to impose 25% tariffs on all goods from Mexico and Canada, 60% to 100% on all goods coming from China, and 10% to 20% on goods imported from all other countries to promote manufacturing in the U.S. \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb8 Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb8 \u201cThe higher the tariff, the more likely it is that the company will come into the United States and build a factory,\u201d said Trump in an interview with Bloomberg News in October.

Chase CEO issues blunt response to Trump's tariffs The billionaire CEO claimed in a recent interview with CNBC that tariffs are \u201can economic tool\u201d and \u201can economic weapon.\u201d \u201cPeople arguing, is it inflationary and non-inflationary? I would put in perspective, if it\u2019s a little inflationary, but it\u2019s good for national security, so be it,\u201d said Dimon. \u201cI mean, get over it. National security trumps a little bit more inflation.\u201d Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., at the UK Global Investment Summit at Hampton Court Palace in London, UK, on Monday, Nov. 27, 2023. Bloomberg/Getty Images Dimon also highlighted the importance of how the Trump administration will use these tariffs to accomplish its goals. \u201cThe question is how they get used,\u201d Dimon said. \u201cCan they get, be used to bring people to the table? Yes. Is there some unfair trade? Yes. Is there some state-owned set subsidies? Yes. You know, is the president going to use that way in his team? Yeah, and we\u2019ll see. But you know, how it gets played out, we\u2019re going to find out.\u201d Story Continues Related: Jamie Dimon\u2019s net worth: Base pay, incentives & billionaire status Trump's tariffs can have unintentional consequences In November 2024, the National Retail Federation warned that Trump\u2019s tariffs would impact the price of products in categories such as apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear, and travel goods across the country.

12:15 AM 6 min read In This Article: BBY We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks & Elon Musk Vs Sam Altman . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE:BBY) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed. In a fresh appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started out by commenting on European stock markets. At the start of the day, markets were doing well and European stocks had actually outpaced American stocks in year-to-date performance. Cramer was surprised by their performance because he was \u201cgetting a lot of reports about how people are more negative about Europe than ever.\u201d In fact he quoted the manager of one of the largest asset management firms in the world informing him about the \u201cunmitigated negativity\u201d surrounding European stocks. Cramer reiterated his favored investing approach and reminded users about the need to look deeper than simply analyzing broader market performance. He shared that the strong European performance might \u201cbe short lived, because I\u2019m trying to find companies that are doing really well in Europe. And I can\u2019t really find them.\u201d On the flip side, Cramer was able to find many companies \u201cthat are doing well in the United States.\u201d Naturally, when discussing top-performing US stocks, one firm that\u2019s unavoidable is Wall Street\u2019s favorite AI GPU stock whose GPUs are powering up all AI models. The stock had opened lower during the day, and Cramer pinned its performance on \u201cnegative things over at Korea!\u201d These \u2018things\u2019 concerned the earnings report of Korean memory manufacturer SK Hynix, whose report had created doubts in investors\u2019 minds about the demand for AI GPUs. His latest stock market comments aren\u2019t the only ones this year. In an earlier show, Cramer remarked on the breadth of market performance as opposed to the rise of just one or two indexes. He had outlined that despite the breadth that markets were experiencing, \u201cthe S&P oscillator I follow, [inaudible] is slightly overbought, there\u2019s a lot more room.\u201d Cramer added that even though technology stocks continued to impress, \u201cthere\u2019s a considerable part of the market that has done nothing. Nothing for years. And that\u2019s coming on.\u201d He didn\u2019t hold back about small-cap stocks either. The CNBC host believes \u201cThat stuff doesn\u2019t work. People always try to chin that up. And then somebody sells a big small cap derivative.\u201d Another hot topic in the media, particularly after President Trump\u2019s inauguration, has been the role that the ultra-wealthy might play in the US government. Cramer outlined previously that electric vehicle and aerospace billionaire Elon Musk has had a large role to play here. He shared that if you go back over the councils that were disbanded post-Charlottesville, what you would see are a lot of traditional industrialists and drug companies.\u201d Cramer added that these individuals represented traditional wealth in America and they \u201cwere the people that were not drawn to, by Elon Musk. Elon Musk has changed the equation.\u201d Story Continues This time around, he remarked on the feud between Elon Musk and OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman over President Trump\u2019s $500 billion Stargate AI project. \u201cI mean, you gotta talk about, oligarchs are mad at each other,\u201d Cramer said. The fights make him want to \u201cdo [a] oligarch mad at each other segment.\u201d Cramer also shared what he believes might be the motivating factors behind President Trump\u2019s intent to place tariffs on America\u2019s trading partners. According to him: \u201cLook I do think that when we hear Trump talk about it he\u2019s really just saying, listen we got a big trade deficit with you and we gotta put a tariff on unless you buy our stuff. And that therefore people are not as worried. I still come back with Mexico, Finally, the CNBC host had some good news on the inflationary front. He believes \u201cthat things are going to have to roll back prices, things have gotten too expensive.\u201d Our Methodology To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 23rd. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in?

( see more details here ). Jim Cramer Has Nothing Good to Say About Best Buy (BBY) \u2013 Here\u2019s Why A busy retail store showcasing a wide range of consumer electronics. Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE: BBY ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 37 Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE:BBY) is a well-known technology and home appliance retailer. Its exposure to consumer spending for pricey items makes it unsurprising that the shares gained a modest 12% in 2024. Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE:BBY)\u2019s shares have been on a roller coaster in 2024. They surged by 15% in August after its cost-cutting and promotional strategies led to an upgraded full-year EPS to $6.10 and $6.35 from an earlier $5.75 to $6.20. Yet, Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE:BBY)\u2019s stock dipped by 9% in November after comparable sales dropped by 2.8%. Cramer\u2019s latest remarks for the firm mentioned AI PCs: \u201cI have a charitable trust, my meeting, my monthly meeting, and I have Best Buy on and I don\u2019t have anything good to say. And we have positions where, you know what, I don\u2019t have anything good to say. And that is because I believed in the AI PC. And we gotta drop it by the way. We gotta stop talking about how the AI PC is going to take the world by storm. Because nobody cares.\u201d Overall, BBY ranks 6th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of BBY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BBY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock .
