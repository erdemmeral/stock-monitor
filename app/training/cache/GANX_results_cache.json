[{"text": "All You Need to Know About Gain Therapeutics (GANX) Rating Upgrade to Strong Buy Zacks Equity Research Thu, Jan 16, 2025, 8:00 PM 3 min read In This Article: GANX +1.41% Investors might want to bet on Gain Therapeutics, Inc. (GANX), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices. The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system. Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements. As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Gain Therapeutics is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price. Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock. Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Gain Therapeutics imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher. Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Story Continues Earnings Estimate Revisions for Gain Therapeutics This company is expected to earn -$1 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2024, which represents a year-over-year change of 41.5%. Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Gain Therapeutics. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 12.1%. Bottom Line Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.

About GT-02287 Gain Therapeutics\u2019 lead drug candidate, GT-02287, is in clinical development for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) with or without a GBA1 mutation. The orally administered, brain-penetrant small molecule is an allosteric protein modulator that restores the function of the lysosomal protein enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) which becomes misfolded and impaired due to mutations in the GBA1 gene, the most common genetic abnormality associated with PD, or other age-related stress factors. In preclinical models of PD, GT-02287 restored GCase enzymatic function, reduced aggregated \u03b1-synuclein, neuroinflammation and neuronal death, and improved motor function and cognitive performance. Additionally, GT-02287 significantly reduced plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels, an emerging biomarker for neurodegeneration. Compelling preclinical data in models of both GBA1-PD and idiopathic PD, demonstrating a disease-modifying effect after administration of GT-02287, suggests that GT-02287 may have the potential to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson\u2019s disease. Gain\u2019s lead program in Parkinson\u2019s disease has been awarded funding support from The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) and The Silverstein Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s with GBA, as well as from the Eurostars-2 joint program with co-funding from the European Union Horizon 2020 research and Innosuisse \u2013 Swiss Innovation Agency. About Gain Therapeutics, Inc. Gain Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company leading the discovery and development of next generation allosteric therapies. Gain\u2019s lead drug candidate, GT-02287 is currently being evaluated for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease with or without a GBA1 mutation. Results from a Phase 1 study of GT-02287 in healthy volunteers demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability, plasma exposure in the projected therapeutic range, CNS exposure, and target engagement and modulation of GCase enzyme. Gain\u2019s unique approach enables the discovery of novel, allosteric small molecule modulators that can restore or disrupt protein function. Deploying its highly advanced Magellan\u2122 platform, Gain is accelerating drug discovery and unlocking novel disease-modifying treatments for untreatable or difficult-to-treat disorders including neurodegenerative diseases, rare genetic disorders and oncology.

Gene Mack, newly appointed CEO of Gain, added, \u201cI am honored by the opportunity to lead the passionate team we have here at Gain \u2013 a team that I have grown very fond of after experiencing firsthand during 2024 how uniformly committed everyone is to our mission of developing truly disease-altering treatments that go beyond temporary symptom relief. I look forward to providing continuing support and contributing to the impressive work being done by my colleagues at Gain as we guide our lead candidate, GT-02287, through the currently ongoing Phase 1b trial in people with Parkinson\u2019s Disease during the first half of 2025, while also preparing for potential Phase 2 activities during the second half of 2025.\u201d Story Continues Gene has over 25 years of experience in the life sciences sector spanning clinical research, financing and capital markets, investing, corporate strategy and business development. Prior to joining Gain, Gene was CFO at privately held Imcyse SA between 2021 and 2023. Prior to Imcyse, Gene was CFO at OncoC4, a privately held biotechnology company that spun out of Merck & Co\u2019s (MSD) acquisition of OncoImmune in 2020 where he had also been CFO. Before that, he has held the CFO role for several development- and commercial-stage biopharmaceutical companies.

Gene received his BS in Biochemistry and MBA in Finance from Fordham University. About GT-02287 Gain Therapeutics\u2019 lead drug candidate, GT-02287, is in clinical development for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) with or without a GBA1 mutation. The orally administered, brain-penetrant small molecule is an allosteric protein modulator that restores the function of the lysosomal protein enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) which becomes misfolded and impaired due to mutations in the GBA1 gene, the most common genetic abnormality associated with PD, or other age-related stress factors. In preclinical models of PD, GT-02287 restored GCase enzymatic function, reduced aggregated \u03b1-synuclein, neuroinflammation and neuronal death, and improved motor function and cognitive performance. Additionally, GT-02287 significantly reduced plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels, an emerging biomarker for neurodegeneration. Compelling preclinical data in models of both GBA1-PD and idiopathic PD, demonstrating a disease-modifying effect after administration of GT-02287, suggests that GT-02287 may have the potential to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson\u2019s disease. Gain\u2019s lead program in Parkinson\u2019s disease has been awarded funding support from The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) and The Silverstein Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s with GBA, as well as from the Eurostars-2 joint program with co-funding from the European Union Horizon 2020 research and Innosuisse \u2013 Swiss Innovation Agency.

Parkinson\u2019s Disease Gain Therapeutics, Inc. Mon, Dec 23, 2024, 3:30 PM 6 min read In This Article: GANX +1.41% Gain Therapeutics, Inc. The Company has received approval to begin enrollment of the Phase 1b clinical trial in Australia Phase 1b clinical trial will assess safety and tolerability along with biomarkers during three months of dosing with GT-02287 in people diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease Phase 1b clinical trial follows successful Phase 1 study in which GT-02287 was safe and well tolerated while demonstrating GCase target engagement BETHESDA, Md., Dec. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gain Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: GANX) (\u201cGain\u201d, or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a clinical-stage biotechnology company leading the discovery and development of the next generation of allosteric small molecule therapies, today announced it has received approval in Australia to initiate a Phase 1b trial. Gain will be working with local Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) advocacy groups to support enrollment and expects enrollment to complete in the spring of 2025 with data from the study expected mid-2025. GT-02287 is the Company\u2019s lead allosteric small molecule in clinical development for the treatment of PD with or without a GBA1 mutation. The primary goal of the Phase 1b trial is to assess the safety and tolerability of GT-02287 in people with PD. The Phase 1b trial follows the successful Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers completed during Q3 2024, in which GT-02287 demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile as well as plasma and CNS exposures in the projected therapeutic range. Importantly, the Phase 1 study also showed significant target engagement of GT-02287 demonstrated by a statistically significant increase in glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity that was >50%. \u201cIt is a fitting end to what has been a transformative year for Gain Therapeutics with the initiation of our Phase 1b clinical trial for GT-02287 in Australia. During 2024, Gain Therapeutics made the significant transition from preclinical to clinical stage development with successful completion of the healthy volunteer studies. We believe GT-02287 has the potential to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson\u2019s disease and look forward to further evaluating the safety and tolerability of GT-02287; while also observing its impact on key biomarkers of Parkinson\u2019s disease after three months of administration in the Phase 1b trial. Gain Therapeutics welcomes the New Year and we are excited to take another critical step towards advancing GT-02287 into Phase 2 trial preparation in 2025 following results of the Phase 1b trial, expected mid-year 2025,\u201d said Gene Mack, CFO and Interim CEO of Gain Therapeutics. Story Continues Jonas Hannestad, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer of Gain, continued, \u201cThe Phase 1b clinical trial of GT-02287 will be conducted at seven sites covering the major metropolitan areas in Australia, all of which have experience with Parkinson\u2019s disease trials. Historically, a limited number of clinical trials in Parkinson\u2019s disease have included Australian sites, and we have heard from both investigators and potential participants that they are eager to have the opportunity to partake in this study.\u201d The Phase 1b open-label trial will assess the safety and tolerability of 13.5 mg/kg/day of GT-02287 for three months in patients with GBA1-PD or idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease. Secondary endpoints include pharmacokinetics, GCase modulation, levels of GCase substrates, and other biomarkers in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Data from the Phase 1b trial is anticipated mid-2025. For more information visit: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06732180 About GT-02287 Gain Therapeutics\u2019 lead drug candidate, GT-02287, is in clinical development for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) with or without a GBA1 mutation. The orally administered, brain-penetrant small molecule is an allosteric protein modulator that restores the function of the lysosomal protein enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) which becomes misfolded and impaired due to mutations in the GBA1 gene, the most common genetic abnormality associated with PD, or other age-related stress factors. In preclinical models of PD, GT-02287 restored GCase enzymatic function, reduced aggregated \u03b1-synuclein, neuroinflammation and neuronal death, and improved motor function and cognitive performance. Additionally, GT-02287 significantly reduced plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels, an emerging biomarker for neurodegeneration. Compelling preclinical data in models of both GBA1-PD and idiopathic PD, demonstrating a disease-modifying effect after administration of GT-02287, suggests that GT-02287 may have the potential to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson\u2019s disease. Gain\u2019s lead program in Parkinson\u2019s disease has been awarded funding support from The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) and The Silverstein Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s with GBA, as well as from the Eurostars-2 joint program with co-funding from the European Union Horizon 2020 research and Innosuisse \u2013 Swiss Innovation Agency. About Gain Therapeutics, Inc. Gain Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company leading the discovery and development of next generation allosteric therapies. Gain\u2019s lead drug candidate, GT-02287 is currently being evaluated for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease with or without a GBA1 mutation. Results from a Phase 1 study of GT-02287 in healthy volunteers demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability, plasma exposure in the projected therapeutic range, CNS exposure, and target engagement and modulation of GCase enzyme. Gain\u2019s unique approach enables the discovery of novel, allosteric small molecule modulators that can restore or disrupt protein function. Deploying its highly advanced Magellan\u2122 platform, Gain is accelerating drug discovery and unlocking novel disease-modifying treatments for untreatable or difficult-to-treat disorders including neurodegenerative diseases, rare genetic disorders and oncology.

Wed, Dec 11, 2024, 4:30 PM 4 min read In This Article: GANX +1.41% Gain Therapeutics, Inc. Presentation to Feature Lead Drug Candidate GT-02287 and Magellan Drug Discovery Platform BETHESDA, Md., Dec. 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gain Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: GANX) (\u201cGain\u201d, or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a clinical-stage biotechnology company leading the discovery and development of the next generation of allosteric small molecule therapies, today announced that Gene Mack, Chief Financial Officer and Interim Chief Executive Officer of Gain, will give a corporate presentation at Biotech Showcase 2025, being held January 13-15, 2025, at the Hilton San Francisco Union Square in San Francisco, CA. Date: Tuesday, January 14 Time: 9:30am PT Track: Yosemite A (Ballroom Level) Biotech Showcase, produced by Demy-Colton and EBD Group, is an investor conference\u00a0focused on driving advances in therapeutic development by providing a sophisticated\u00a0networking platform for executives and investors that fosters investment and partnership\u00a0opportunities. The conference takes place each year in San Francisco during the course of\u00a0one of the industry's largest gatherings and busiest weeks. About GT-02287 Gain Therapeutics\u2019 lead drug candidate, GT-02287, is in clinical development for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) with or without a GBA1 mutation. The orally administered, brain-penetrant small molecule is an allosteric protein modulator that restores the function of the lysosomal protein enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) which becomes misfolded and impaired due to mutations in the GBA1 gene, the most common genetic abnormality associated with PD, or other age-related stress factors. In preclinical models of PD, GT-02287 restored GCase enzymatic function, reduced aggregated \u03b1-synuclein, neuroinflammation and neuronal death, and improved motor function and cognitive performance. Additionally, GT-02287 significantly reduced plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels, an emerging biomarker for neurodegeneration. Compelling preclinical data in models of both GBA1-PD and idiopathic PD, demonstrating a disease-modifying effect after administration of GT-02287, suggests that GT-02287 may have the potential to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson\u2019s disease. Gain\u2019s lead program in Parkinson\u2019s disease has been awarded funding support from The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) and The Silverstein Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s with GBA, as well as from the Eurostars-2 joint program with co-funding from the European Union Horizon 2020 research and Innosuisse \u2013 Swiss Innovation Agency. About Gain Therapeutics, Inc. Gain Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company leading the discovery and development of next generation allosteric therapies. Gain\u2019s lead drug candidate, GT-02287 is currently being evaluated for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease with or without a GBA1 mutation. Results from a Phase 1 study of GT-02287 in healthy volunteers demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability, plasma exposure in the projected therapeutic range, CNS exposure, and target engagement and modulation of GCase enzyme. Story Continues Gain\u2019s unique approach enables the discovery of novel, allosteric small molecule modulators that can restore or disrupt protein function. Deploying its highly advanced Magellan\u2122 platform, Gain is accelerating drug discovery and unlocking novel disease-modifying treatments for untreatable or difficult-to-treat disorders including neurodegenerative diseases, rare genetic disorders and oncology.

Fri, Nov 15, 2024, 12:05 AM 10 min read In This Article: GANX +1.41% Gain Therapeutics, Inc. Initiation of Phase 1b Study of GT-02287 in Parkinson\u2019s patients expected by end of 2024 BETHESDA, Md., Nov. 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gain Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: GANX) (\u201cGain\u201d, or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a clinical-stage biotechnology company leading the discovery and development of the next generation of allosteric small molecule therapies, today reports financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provides a corporate update. \u201cThe third quarter of 2024 marked substantial progress for Gain and the development of GT-02287, our lead candidate for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease in patients with or without the GBA1 mutation. Data from our Phase 1 study for GT-02287 presented recently at both the International Congress of Parkinson\u2019s Disease and Movement Disorders and the Michael J Fox Foundation Annual Parkinson's Disease Therapeutics Conference demonstrated target engagement with a 53% increase in GCase activity along with favorable safety and tolerability in healthy volunteers. We believe these outcomes derisk the upcoming Phase 1b study in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease, which remains on track to initiate before year end 2024. We also submitted the pre-IND package for our upcoming meeting with the FDA scheduled before year end to facilitate the Phase 2 expansion of our clinical development plans for GT-02287 in 2025, moving us significantly closer to developing the first disease-modifying therapy for patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease,\u201d said Gene Mack, Interim CEO and CFO of Gain Therapeutics. Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Corporate Highlights Pipeline Updates Announced positive results from the Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) part of the Phase 1 study of GT-02287, the Company\u2019s lead candidate being evaluated for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease with or without a GBA1 mutation. Results from the study demonstrated the safety and tolerability of GT-02287 along with an increase in GCase activity of 53% in healthy volunteers. The positive results from the Phase 1 study and design of the upcoming Phase 1b clinical trial were featured at the following conferences: A late-breaker poster and oral presentation at the International Congress of Parkinson\u2019s Disease and Movement Disorders in September 2024 in Philadelphia, PA. The poster is available here . An oral presentation at the Michael J. Fox Foundation\u2019s 16 th Annual Parkinson\u2019s Disease Therapeutics Conference in October 2024 in New York, NY. A virtual webinar hosted by Gain Therapeutics in September 2024 that reviewed all the data from the study. A replay of the event can be accessed here . Presented preclinical data at the Neuroscience 2024 conference in October 2024 in Chicago, IL that the Company believes further elucidates the disease modifying potential of GT-02287 by evaluating the effect of withdrawing treatment in animal models and the improvement in mitochondrial health related to administration of GT-02287. GT-02287 was shown to rescue deficits in neuromuscular function and motor coordination in animal models of GBA1 and idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease models and to prevent the development of deficits in cognition and activities of daily living. Notably, withdrawal of GT-02287 for more than one week did not significantly affect performance in any of the tests, suggesting a disease-modifying effect. GT-02287 reduced the level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as ameliorating lysosomal pathology, reducing \u03b1-synuclein aggregation, and providing a neuroprotective effect. In an in vivo model in which mice were subjected to toxic insult by CBE and injection of \u03b1-synuclein preformed fibrils (PFFs) into the striatum \u2013 delayed administration of GT-02287 reduced levels of mitochondrial protein Miro1, an important maker for mitophagy; aggregated \u03b1-synuclein and plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL), a marker of neurodegeneration; as well as completely restoring motor function to control levels. Presented poster in October 2024 in Barcelona, Spain highlighting the Company\u2019s Magellan\u2122 drug discovery platform to identify allosteric inhibitors targeting discoidin domain receptor 2 at the 36 th EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium. Story Continues Upcoming Milestones Initiation of Phase 1b trial evaluating GT-02287 in Parkinson\u2019s disease patients expected in Q4 2024 Pre-IND meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) anticipated by the end of 2024 Q3 2024 Financial Results Research and development expenses increased by $0.3 million to $2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily related to costs associated with the Clinical Phase 1 trial of our lead program GT-02287 for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s Disease. General and administrative expenses decreased by $0.7 million to $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the period was primarily attributable to a decrease in legal and professional fees relating to general corporate matters and a decrease in stock-based compensation expenses. Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $0.17 per share, basic and diluted, compared to $0.37 per share, basic and diluted, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities were $12 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $16.8 million as of December 31, 2023. About Gain Therapeutics, Inc.
