Three-Quarters of CFOs Project Double-Digit Growth in 2025: FTI Consulting\u2019s Global CFO Report FTI Consulting, Inc. Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 3:30 PM 3 min read In This Article: FCN -0.65% FTI Consulting, Inc. WASHINGTON, Jan. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FTI Consulting, Inc. (NYSE: FCN) today announced the release of its 2025 Global CFO Report , which reveals almost three-quarters (72%) of Chief Financial Officers expect revenue growth of 10% or more over the next 12 months. The survey, which collected the views of 655 senior finance executives across North America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa; Asia; and Australia, was conducted by the firm\u2019s Office of the CFO Solutions practice in collaboration with CFO Dive . More than three-quarters (77%) of CFOs surveyed from larger companies, those with revenues greater than $5 billion, remain highly optimistic about revenue growth in the coming year despite economic pressures driven by supply chain improvements and favorable market conditions. However, talent retention and financial forecasting still remain challenging for this group. Mid-market firms with revenues between $100 million and $1 billion are adjusting expectations, with only 67.5% of CFOs surveyed predicting double-digit growth for 2025, down from 76% in 2024. The decrease may stem from rising costs, increased competition and talent shortages. \u201cDespite market volatility and economic pressures, this survey reflects what we\u2019re seeing from our CFO clients: confidence in the ability of their businesses to expand,\u201d said Gina Gutzeit , Global Leader of the Office of the CFO Solutions practice at FTI Consulting. \u201cAdditionally, CFO roles have shifted beyond traditional financial stewardship; they are placing more emphasis on strategic planning to help navigate the technological advancements and evolving business models needed to stay competitive.\u201d Additional insights from the global survey include: Cybersecurity was ranked in the top three strategic priorities for CFOs across all regions surveyed. In North America, 75% of respondents say cyber attacks are among their top challenges, leading to investment in robust defenses. Outsourcing finance functions has increased by 11% from 2024 to 2025. This increase highlights the growing reliance on external capabilities as CFOs seek to enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs and improve access to both technology and skills, without sacrificing capacity. CFO turnover rates are changing. While the majority (54%) of respondents still view the average tenure of a CFO at one company to be between three to five years, the number of respondents believing CFO tenure is five years or longer has increased 5% from 2024. This shift suggests organizations are valuing\u00a0strategic leadership from CFOs, especially as they navigate complex challenges and market uncertainty. CFOs continue to emphasize the importance of improving forecasting capabilities, with 85% identifying forecasting accuracy as a primary area needing improvement. 87% of CFOs stated that they plan to use AI tools within the next 12 months, demonstrating a commitment to leveraging innovative tools that can enhance predictive capabilities. Story Continues \u201cWhether it\u2019s navigating their organizations through inflation, supply chain disruption or competitive pressures, the strategic CFO doesn\u2019t sit on the sidelines; they are in the thick of it, driving decisions that shape the future of their organization,\u201d said Alan Numsuwan , an Executive Vice President in FTI Consulting\u2019s Office of the CFO Solutions practice. \u201cAs we have seen more and more, CFOs are driving growth through finance-led decision support and taking an increased role in business strategy.\u201d For more information, read the full survey report here .

Dive Brief: A new partnership between off-grid power systems provider DC Grid and energy services firm Liberty Energy seeks to provide data centers and EV hubs with modular, scalable off-grid power solutions in a matter of months, the companies announced Jan. 7. The partners expect to be able to deploy \u201csmall scale power output\u201d\u00a0within three months for fleet EV charging hubs and \u201chundreds of megawatts\u201d within 12-18 months for data centers,\u00a0they said in the announcement. The partnership expects to be \u201cespecially useful for data centers and fleet EV hubs that are in long queues for service upgrades from the local utilities,\u201d said DC Grid CEO and founder Vic Shao . Dive Insight: In many parts of North America, utilities and regional power grid operators have seen a surge in requests for heavy power users to connect to the grid. In the Houston area, for example, electric utility CenterPoint Energy saw a 700% year-over-year increase in interconnection requests from data center developers in 2024, Bloomberg reported on Oct. 28. FTI Consulting expects global electricity demand from data centers and AI clusters to increase from 41 gigawatts in 2023 to 71 GW in 202 7 as the average facility in some areas, like Northern Virginia, grows from about 30 megawatts to as much as 90 MW. Utilities are racing to upgrade their grids in response. CenterPoint invested about $3.7 billion in its Houston network in 2024 and plans to spend another $4.9 billion in 2025, Data Center Dynamics reported. But major infrastructure upgrades, such as new transmission lines, require lengthy planning and permitting processes that can take five to 10 years to bring online, FTI Consulting noted. And in congested power markets with lots of existing data centers, new data centers face long waits to connect to the grid, it said. The DC Grid and Liberty Energy partnership aims to help customers sidestep these bottlenecks and \u201caccelerate deployment timelines for critical infrastructure projects,\u201d the partners said. The collaboration combines DC Grid\u2019s off-grid modular direct-current power systems with Liberty Energy\u2019s \u201clow emissions mobile power generation\u201d systems, which can run on fossil gas, renewable natural gas or hydrogen, the companies said. The modular design allows systems to scale with sites\u2019 power needs, they added. DC Grid\u2019s 300-kilowatt EV charging station contains four dual NACS/CCS DC fast chargers with a total of eight ports. Its data center solution is a server rack-mounted module that connects directly to on-site power generation equipment. Story continues DC Grid says its \u201cproprietary EV charging and datacenter technologies operate at 99% efficiency,\u201d resulting in minimal loss and waste heat during operation. Compared with traditional power systems connected to the commercial grid, its solutions avoid up to 20% of energy losses from power conversion and up to 33% in transmission and distribution systems, it said in a Dec. 19 press release . A DC Grid spokesperson declined to answer detailed questions about the Liberty Energy partnership.

Consulting, Inc. \u2019s FCN top line is driven by diversification and international operations. Rising regulatory scrutiny and corporate litigation boost demand for the company\u2019s products and services. Meanwhile, rising expenses hurt profitability. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FCN\u2019s 2024 earnings is pegged at $8.1 per share, indicating 5.1% growth from the year-ago reported level. For 2025, FTI Consulting\u2019s bottom line is pegged at $8.6 per share, suggesting a 6.5% year-over-year increase. Factors That Auger Well for FCN\u2019s Success Diversified offerings and international operations fuel FTI Consulting\u2019s top-line growth prospects. International businesses generated nearly 37% of its revenues in 2023. The diverse array of practices and services, multiple revenue streams, industry expertise and global reach differentiate FCN from its competitors. Demand for FTI Consulting\u2019s products is anticipated to be driven by rising regulatory scrutiny and a proliferation of corporate litigation. The necessity for structural change in the dynamic global markets as management teams look to fend off rivals, protect IP rights and transform businesses via mergers and acquisitions, divestiture and other restructuring activities calls for FCN\u2019s specialized skill sets to boost revenues. It is impressive that FTI Consulting relies on share buybacks to reward shareholders. In 2021, 2022 and 2023, the company repurchased shares worth $46.1 million, $85.4 million and $21 million, respectively. These initiatives instill investor confidence and positively impact the bottom line. FCN's balance sheet looks strong. It had $386 million in cash and cash equivalents as of Sept. 30, 2024, against no debt. The majority of the cash is available for investments in growth initiatives. The company\u2019s solid cash reserves contribute to its strong liquidity. At the end of the third quarter of 2024, FCN reported a current ratio of 2.09, above the industry's average of 1.25. A current ratio above 1 suggests efficient short-term debt coverage. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Risks Faced by FTI Consulting FCN\u2019s operating expenses surged on the back of rising direct costs of revenues, and selling, general and administrative expenses rising significantly. Operating expenses increased 10.6% year over year in 2022 and 14.2% in 2023. Increments as such can deter investments, hurting profitability and weakening the company's appeal to investors seeking efficient cost management and robust returns. FTI Consulting never declared dividends and does not intend to. Dividend-seeking investors should avoid buying the stock.

About the Consulting Services Industry Companies grouped under the Consulting Services category offer professional advice in management, IT, human resources, environmental regulations, logistics and marketing, and real estate, serving multiple end markets. The space includes prominent names such as Accenture and Gartner. The industry focuses on channeling money and efforts toward more effective operational components, such as technology, digital transformation and data-driven decision-making. To position themselves suitably in the post-pandemic era and better utilize opportunities that an economic recovery will bring, service providers are increasing their efforts toward formulating and reassessing strategic initiatives, identifying sources of demand and targeting end markets. What's Shaping the Future of the Consulting Services Industry? Exponential Growth: This multi-billion-dollar industry has witnessed exponential growth since the 2008 financial crisis, enjoying steady revenues, profit and cash-flow growth. Consequently, the trend has enabled most industry players to pay out stable dividends. Economic Recovery: The sector is a major beneficiary of the broader economy and service activities. According to the \"third\" estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, GDP grew at an annual rate of 3.1% in the third quarter of 2024 compared with 3% growth in the second quarter. Economic activities in the non-manufacturing sector are in good shape. As of September, the Services PMI, measured by the Institute for Supply Management, had stayed above the 50% mark for the 52nd time in 55 months since recovery from the pandemic. Strong Demand Environment: The consulting services industry is one of those least affected by the pandemic and its after-effects. This is because even in a volatile situation, organizations require extensive advice on protecting their employees and staying closer to consumers and shareholders. This industry is one of the earliest pioneers of remote working that has become part of the new normal. The nature of work enables industry players to function efficiently through the increased use of technology.

International Operations Despite High Operating Expenses Zacks Equity Research Tue, Dec 31, 2024, 8:17 PM 3 min read In This Article: FCN -0.65% FTI Consulting Inc. FCN generates a healthy cash flow due to higher cash collections on increased billings. The company benefits from a robust liquidity position. Meanwhile, rising operating expenses affect its bottom line and the inability to pay dividends might discourage some investors from buying the stock. FCN reported unimpressive third-quarter 2024 results. Quarterly earnings per share of $1.85 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.2% and decreased 21% year over year. Total revenues of $926 million lagged the consensus mark 1.5% but increased 3.7% from the year-ago quarter. How is FTI Consulting Doing? Diversified offerings and international operations aid FCN\u2019s top-line growth. In 2023, 37% of its total revenues were generated from global businesses. The company\u2019s five reportable segments offer a diversified portfolio of practices providing services across four geographic regions. The wide range of practices and services, diversified revenue streams, specialized industry expertise, and global reach sets FTI Consulting apart from its competitors. Such diversification enables the company to mitigate the effects of economic cycles, crises, events and changes in a particular practice in the industry. FTI Consulting generates a significant cash flow. In 2022, it generated $135.7 million in free cash flow, which increased to $174.9 million in 2023. Higher net cash provided by operating activities increased the free cash flow. In 2022, the company generated $188.8 million in operating cash flow and the same rose to $224.5 million in 2023. The surge in this metric was due to higher cash collections resulting from increased billings. FCN\u2019s strategy to reward shareholders through share buybacks is impressive. In 2021, 2022 and 2023, the company repurchased shares worth $46.1 million, $85.4 million and $21 million, respectively. These initiatives not only instill investors\u2019 confidence but also positively impact the bottom line. FTI Consulting's current ratio (a measure of liquidity) stood at 2.09 at the end of the third quarter of 2024, higher than the industry average of 1.25. Although it declined 5% from the preceding quarter, a current ratio of more than 1 indicates that the company will pay off its short-term obligations efficiently. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Risks Faced by FCN The company\u2019s operating expenses increased 10.6% year over year in 2022 and 14.2% in 2023. FCN incurred significantly higher selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) in 2023 compared with 2022. The company reported a higher SG&A due to higher non-billable compensation expenses, which include the impacts of the rise in non-billable headcount, rising bad debt, outside services, and other general and administrative expenses. Such an increase in expenses can put the bottom line under pressure. Story Continues FTI Consulting never declared and does not have any plan to pay out cash dividends on common stock at present. Such actions discourage dividend-seeking investors from buying its shares. FCN\u2019s Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider FTI Consulting carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.
