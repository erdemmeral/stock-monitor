Factors Likely to Shape UPS\u2019s Q4 Results We expect high labor costs to have hurt United Parcel Service\u2019s bottom-line performance in the quarter under review. The labor deal inked with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in 2023 is likely to have increased labor costs. Low fuel costs are expected to have aided UPS\u2019s bottom-line performance in the December-end quarter. The top-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter is likely to have been driven by higher revenues from the U.S. Domestic Package segment and the International Package unit. The U.S. Domestic Package segment has likely been driven by the strong retail sales environment and International Package unit on increased exports from China. We expect revenues from the U.S. Domestic Package segment to increase 1.7% in the fourth quarter of 2024 from the prior-year quarter\u2019s actual. Reportedly, Chinese exports to the United States rose in the double digits (percentage-wise) in December from a year ago. The impressive increase came as factories rushed to fill orders to beat higher tariffs threatened to be imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump on Chinese goods. The significant rise in China exports is expected to have boosted United Parcel Service\u2019s international revenues in the December-end quarter. We expect revenues from the International Package segment to increase 5% year over year in the December-end quarter. Story Continues Dismal Price Performance UPS Stock The UPS stock has performed unimpressively on the bourses in a year. The stock has depreciated 16.3%, performing worse than its\u00a0industry\u2019s 10.2% decline in the same timeframe. The S&P 500 composite index rose 25.3% in the same time frame and the Zacks\u00a0Transportation\u00a0sector inched up 0.9%. UPS has also lagged its rival FedEx FDX and another industry player, Air Transport Services ATSG, in a year. One-year Price Comparison Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research UPS Trades Cheaper Than Sector From a valuation perspective, United Parcel Service is trading at a discount compared with the sector based on its price/sales ratio. The company is trading at a forward sales multiple of 1.2 compared with its sector\u2019s 1.83. The company has a Value Score of A. The reading is also below its median of 1.54 over the last five years. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Investment Thesis for UPS Stock It is hardly surprising that e-commerce demand has slowed from the levels witnessed at the peak of the pandemic with the reopening of economies. However, it is still impressive, driven by the convenience associated with online shopping. Strong e-commerce demand should continue to support growth of UPS. The company demonstrated financial strength with $5.3 billion in free cash flow in 2023. Its valuation is attractive as well. Geopolitical uncertainty and high inflation continue to hurt consumer sentiment and growth expectations. For 2024, United Parcel Service anticipates revenues of $91 billion (prior view: $93 billion).\u00a0For 2024, UPS expects a consolidated adjusted operating margin of 9.6%. High labor costs are hurting the bottom line. Final Thoughts We can safely conclude that investors should refrain from rushing to buy United Parcel Service, which is facing quite a few challenges, ahead of its earnings release on Jan. 30. Instead, they should monitor the developments pertaining to the stock closely for a more appropriate entry point, as an erroneous and hasty decision could affect portfolio gains. UPS\u2019s current Zacks Rank supports our thesis. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

months have been a windfall for Air Transport Services\u2019s shareholders. The company\u2019s stock price has jumped 55.1%, hitting $22.09 per share. This performance may have investors wondering how to approach the situation. Is now the time to buy Air Transport Services, or should you be careful about including it in your portfolio? Check out our in-depth research report to see what our analysts have to say, it\u2019s free . We\u2019re happy investors have made money, but we're sitting this one out for now. Here are three reasons why there are better opportunities than ATSG and a stock we'd rather own. Why Do We Think Air Transport Services Will Underperform? Founded in 1980, Air Transport Services Group (NASDAQ:ATSG) provides air cargo transportation and logistics solutions. 1. Revenue Growth Flatlining Long-term growth is the most important, but within industrials, a stretched historical view may miss new industry trends or demand cycles. Air Transport Services\u2019s recent history shows its demand slowed as its revenue was flat over the last two years. We also note many other Air Freight and Logistics businesses have faced declining sales because of cyclical headwinds. While Air Transport Services\u2019s growth wasn\u2019t the best, it did perform better than its peers. Air Transport Services Year-On-Year Revenue Growth 2. Operating Margin Falling Operating margin is a key measure of profitability. Think of it as net income - the bottom line - excluding the impact of taxes and interest on debt, which are less connected to business fundamentals. Looking at the trend in its profitability, Air Transport Services\u2019s operating margin decreased by 6.4 percentage points over the last five years. Even though its historical margin is high, shareholders will want to see Air Transport Services become more profitable in the future. Its operating margin for the trailing 12 months was 6.3%. Air Transport Services Operating Margin (GAAP) 3. EPS Trending Down We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) because it highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable. Sadly for Air Transport Services, its EPS declined by 12.4% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 8.1%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded. Air Transport Services Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) Final Judgment Air Transport Services falls short of our quality standards. Following the recent rally, the stock trades at 18.9\u00d7 forward price-to-earnings (or $22.09 per share). While this valuation is reasonable, we don\u2019t see a big opportunity at the moment. There are better investments elsewhere. We\u2019d recommend looking at ServiceNow, one of our all-time favorite software stocks with a durable competitive moat . Story Continues Stocks We Would Buy Instead of Air Transport Services The elections are now behind us.

Transport Services (ATSG) Stock Options Zacks Equity Research Tue, Jan 7, 2025, 4:52 PM 2 min read In This Article: ATSG -0.09% Investors in Air Transport Services Group, Inc. ATSG need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Mar 21, 2025 $10 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. What is Implied Volatility? Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy. What do the Analysts Think? Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Air Transport Services shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Air Transport Services is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry that ranks in the Top 37% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has moved from 33 cents per share to 35 cents in that period. Given the way analysts feel about Air Transport Services right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected. Looking to Trade Options?

(the \"Transaction\"), including the expected time period to consummate the Transaction, the anticipated benefits (including synergies) of the Transaction and integration and transition plans, opportunities, anticipated future performance, expected share buyback programs and expected dividends. All such forward-looking statements are based upon current plans, estimates, expectations and ambitions that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond the control of Air Transport Services Group, Inc. (the \"Company\"), that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements. Key factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to, the expected timing and likelihood of completion of the Transaction, including the timing, receipt and terms and conditions of any required governmental and regulatory approvals of the Transaction; the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the definitive agreement; the possibility that the Company\u2019s stockholders may not approve the Transaction; the risk that the anticipated tax treatment of the Transaction is not obtained; the risk that the parties may not be able to satisfy the conditions to the Transaction in a timely manner or at all; risks related to disruption of management time from ongoing business operations due to the Transaction; the risk that any announcements relating to the Transaction could have adverse effects on the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock; the risk that the Transaction and its announcement could have an adverse effect on the parties\u2019 business relationships and business generally, including the ability of the Company to retain customers and retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with their suppliers and customers, and on their operating results and businesses generally; the risk of unforeseen or unknown liabilities; customer, shareholder, regulatory and other stakeholder approvals and support; the risk of unexpected future capital expenditures; the risk of potential litigation relating to the Transaction that could be instituted against the Company or its directors and/or officers; the risk associated with third party contracts containing material consent, anti-assignment, transfer or other provisions that may be related to the Transaction which are not waived or otherwise satisfactorily resolved; the risk of rating agency actions and the Company\u2019s ability to access short- and long-term debt markets on a timely and affordable basis; the risk of various events that could disrupt operations, including severe weather, such as droughts, floods, avalanches and earthquakes, cybersecurity attacks, security threats and governmental response to them, and technological changes; the risks of labor disputes, changes in labor costs and labor difficulties; and the risks resulting from other effects of industry, market, economic, legal or legislative, political or regulatory conditions outside of the Company\u2019s control. All such factors are difficult to predict and are beyond our control, including those detailed in the Company\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (and which is available at https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/894081/000089408124000016/atsg-20231231.htm ), quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents subsequently filed by the Company with the Securities Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and that are available on the Company\u2019s website at https://www.atsginc.com/investors/reports-and-filings/sec-filings and at https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=894081&owner=exclude .

Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results Business Wire Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 3:30 PM 16 min read In This Article: ATSG -0.09% Generates Strong Cash Flow WILMINGTON, Ohio, November 08, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Air Transport Services Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATSG), the leading provider of medium wide-body freighter aircraft leasing, contracted air transportation, and related services, today reported consolidated financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. Those results, as compared with the same period in 2023, were as follows: Third Quarter Results Revenues of $471 million, versus $523 million GAAP Loss per Share from Continuing Operations of ($0.05), versus Earnings per Share (diluted) of $0.24 GAAP Pretax Loss from Continuing Operations of ($5.2) million, versus Pretax Earnings of $23.5 million Adjusted Pretax* Earnings of $10.7 million, versus $31.1 million Adjusted EPS* of $0.13, versus $0.32 Adjusted EBITDA* of $129.5 million, versus $136.6 million Free Cash Flow* was $86.4 million, versus negative $51.6 million As previously announced on November 4, 2024, ATSG entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Stonepeak, a leading alternative investment firm specializing in infrastructure and real assets, in an all-cash transaction with an enterprise valuation of approximately $3.1 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, holders of ATSG common stock will receive $22.50 per share in cash. Upon completion of the transaction, ATSG\u2019s shares will no longer trade on the Nasdaq, and ATSG will become a private company. In light of the announced transaction, ATSG has canceled the third quarter 2024 earnings conference call previously scheduled for Friday, November 8, 2024, and will not provide financial guidance going forward. Mike Berger, chief executive officer of ATSG, said, \"First off, we are excited about our future with Stonepeak. Our leasing business continued to benefit from strong demand for our freighter aircraft, as we added four Boeing 767-300 freighter leases during the third quarter. Our third quarter results were affected by fewer block hours flown than a year ago and higher expenses, including start-up costs to fly ten more aircraft provided by Amazon. I am delighted to report that the 10th aircraft entered operations this week. For the quarter, we once again generated strong free cash flow, bringing the total to $193 million for the year. Going forward, certain contractual price increases effective in the fourth quarter position us for strong improvement in our ACMI Services segment and we expect to execute three new leases for CAM-owned freighters by year-end 2024.\" * Adjusted EPS (Earnings per Share), Adjusted Pretax Earnings, Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization), Free Cash Flow, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures used in this release, which are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP at the end of this release. Story Continues Segment Results Cargo Aircraft Management (CAM) Aircraft leasing and related revenues increased 3% for the third quarter, including the benefit of revenues from eleven additional freighter leases, including ten additional 767-300s and one Airbus A321-200 since the end of September 2023. These lease revenues were more than offset by the scheduled returns of nine 767-200 freighters and six 767-300 freighters over that same period. CAM\u2019s third quarter pretax earnings decreased $5 million, or 22%, to $18 million versus $23 million for the prior-year quarter. Segment depreciation expense increased by $11 million and interest expense by $2 million versus the prior-year quarter. The 2024 results were impacted by the reduction in 767-200 freighter leases and related engine power program revenues, declining $5 million in total versus a year ago. CAM leased four 767s and sold four others to external customers in the third quarter. One 767-200 freighter was returned by an external customer upon lease expiration. At the end of the third quarter, 89 CAM-owned aircraft were leased to external customers, two fewer than a year ago. Nineteen CAM-owned aircraft were in or awaiting conversion to freighters at the end of the third quarter, one fewer than at the end of the prior-year quarter. This included eight 767s, six A321s, and five A330s. One of the A330s is expected to complete conversion and be leased to an external customer in the fourth quarter of 2024. ACMI Services Pretax loss was $14 million in the third quarter, versus pretax earnings of $12 million in the third quarter of 2023. Revenue block hours for ATSG's airlines decreased 13% versus the prior-year quarter. Cargo block hours decreased 7% for the third quarter, reflecting the removal of certain 767-200 freighter aircraft from service and less international flying versus the prior year. Passenger block hours decreased 34% in the quarter. The pretax loss for the third quarter of 2024 included $4.9 million more for customer incentive costs stemming from warrant agreements reached with Amazon in May of 2024. In addition to the reduced flying hours and reduced revenues, ACMI Services experienced increased expenses for maintenance, travel and ground services. During the third quarter, ACMI Services began operating seven Amazon-provided Boeing 767-300 aircraft, with three more added subsequently. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This release, including the attached tables, contains financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") in the United States, and financial measures that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP (\"non-GAAP financial measures\"). Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate historical results and project future results. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures assist in highlighting operational trends, facilitating period-over-period comparisons, and providing additional clarity about events and trends affecting core operating performance. Disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures provides insight to investors about additional metrics that management uses to evaluate past performance and prospects for future performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP and may be calculated differently by other companies. The historical non-GAAP financial measures included in this release are reconciled to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the non-GAAP reconciliation tables included later in this release. The Company does not provide a reconciliation of projected Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EPS, as permitted by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K, because it is unable to predict with reasonable accuracy the value of certain adjustments and as a result, the comparable GAAP measures are unavailable without unreasonable efforts. For example, certain adjustments can be significantly impacted by the re-measurements of financial instruments including stock warrants issued to a customer. The Company\u2019s earnings on a GAAP basis, including its earnings per share on a GAAP basis, and the non-GAAP adjustments for gains and losses resulting from the re-measurement of stock warrants, will depend on, among other things, the future prices of ATSG stock, interest rates, and other assumptions which are highly uncertain. As a result, the Company believes such reconciliations of forward-looking information would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors.

Presenting this measure provides investors with a comparative metric of fundamental operations, while highlighting changes to certain items among periods. Adjusted Pretax Earnings should not be considered an alternative to Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP.

It is a metric that facilitates the comparison of financial results of underlying operations. Additionally, these non-GAAP adjustments are similar to the adjustments used by lenders in the Company\u2019s senior secured credit facility to assess financial performance and determine the cost of borrowed funds. The adjustments also remove the non-service cost components of retiree benefit plans because they are not closely related to ongoing operating activities. To improve comparability between periods, the adjustments also exclude from EBITDA from Continuing Operations the recognition of charges related to the discharge of a foam fire suppression system in a Company aircraft hangar, net of related insurance recoveries. Management presents EBITDA from Continuing Operations (defined below), as a subtotal toward calculating Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA from Continuing Operations (non-GAAP) is defined as Earnings (Loss) from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes plus net interest expense, depreciation, and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA from Continuing Operations less financial instrument revaluation gains or losses, non-service components of retiree benefit costs, amortization of warrant-based customer incentive costs recorded in revenue, charge off of debt issuance costs upon refinancing, costs from non-consolidated affiliates and charges related to the discharge of a foam fire suppression system, net of insurance recoveries.

It does not include expenditures for aircraft acquisitions and related passenger-to-freighter conversion costs. Adjusted Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP) includes cash flow from operating activities net of expenditures for planned aircraft maintenance, engine overhauls and other non-aircraft additions to property and equipment. Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP) is net cash from operating activities reduced for net cash flows from investing activities. Management believes that adjusting GAAP operating cash flows is useful for investors to evaluate the company's ability to generate adjusted free cash flow for growth initiatives, debt service, stock buybacks or other discretionary allocations of capital.

Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Per Share should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. Under U.S. GAAP, certain warrants are reflected as a liability and unrealized warrant gains are typically removed from diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") calculations, while unrealized warrant losses are not removed because they are dilutive to EPS. For each quarter, additional shares assumes that Amazon net settled its remaining warrants that were above the strike price. Each year reflects an average of the quarterly shares. Under U.S. GAAP, certain types of convertible debt are treated under the \"if-convert method\" if dilutive for EPS. Stock-based compensation awards are treated under the \"treasury stock method\" if dilutive for EPS. The non-GAAP presentation adds the dilutive effects that were excluded under GAAP. Removes the amortization of the warrant-based customer incentives which are recorded against revenue over the term of the related aircraft leases and customer contracts. Removes the non-service component effects of employee post-retirement plans.

{"text": "Is Air Transport Services (ATSG) the Best Aviation Stock According to Hedge Funds? Fatima Gulzar Thu, Dec 19, 2024, 8:52 AM 7 min read In This Article: ATSG -0.09% We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Aviation Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Air Transport Services Group Inc. (NASDAQ:ATSG) stands against the other best aviation stocks. Aviation stocks are the shares of firms in the aviation industry, such as airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and airport operators. The global lockdowns triggered by the pandemic caused significant disruptions to the travel industry. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), air travel worldwide decreased by 60% in 2020 as a result of the significant disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. There were only 1.8 billion passengers flying through 2020, down from almost 4.5 billion in 2019, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), while seating capacity dropped by about 50% in 2020. Despite these challenges, the airline industry has regained stability as lockdowns have lifted and normalcy has returned. Verified Market Size estimated that the global airline market will increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.21% from 2024 to 2031, from a 2023 valuation of $569.02 billion to $732.66 billion. The industry is mostly driven by the development of fuel-efficient aircraft and the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the United States claims that the implementation of SAF could cut aviation emissions by as much as 80%, supporting the industry\u2019s sustainability objectives and reducing operating expenses. Currently, airlines are facing record demand. According to AAA, nearly 80 million people were anticipated to travel by road and air this Thanksgiving, with the number of travelers exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Seat occupancy on airplanes has increased from 74% in 2003 to 84% in the first ten months of this year. The seat occupancy rate jumped from 69% in 2004 to 79% this year, even during slower months like January. According to the Consumer Price Index, airfares rose by more than 10% between July and October as a result of the limited availability. Reduced competition and flight cuts by budget carriers, such as a 10% holiday reduction, have further reduced availability, raising prices and reducing the number of reasonably priced options. U.S. Airlines and Aircraft Leasing Analyst Jamie Baker of J.P. Morgan claims, \u201cOur prevailing thesis is that demand for premium and international air travel continues to lead the market.\u201d The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts that airlines will transport about 5 billion passengers by 2024. According to IATA\u2019s 2024 forecasting, airlines should report net earnings of $30.5 billion this year, up from $25.7 billion in December. It was estimated that the industry\u2019s overall revenues would increase by over 10% to a record $996 billion. The projected profit \u201cis a great achievement considering the recent deep pandemic losses,\u201d IATA Director General Willie Walsh said while addressing the annual general assembly of the trade association in Dubai. According to IATA, which has more than 300 members and accounts for 83% of all air traffic globally, North American airlines are expected to generate about half of all profits in 2024, with a projected surplus of $14.8 billion, while European airlines are expected to see an increase in profits of between $8.6 billion and $9 billion. Story Continues According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), industry revenues will exceed $1.007 trillion, a 4.4% rise from 2024, and cross $1 trillion for the first time in 2025. It is projected that the number of passengers will reach 5.2 billion, which would be another significant milestone in the industry\u2019s post-pandemic recovery. Willie Walsh, IATA\u2019s Director General stated: \u201cLooking at 2025, for the first time, traveler numbers will exceed five billion and the number of flights will reach 40 million. This growth means that aviation connectivity will be creating and supporting jobs across the global economy. The most obvious are the hospitality and retail sectors which will gear up to meet the needs of a growing number of customers. But almost every business benefits from the connectivity that air transport provides, making it easier to meet customers, receive supplies, or transport products. On top of this, growth in aviation also contributes to achieving almost all the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),\u201d Methodology We sifted through holdings of Airline ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 Aviation stocks.\u00a0 From the resultant dataset, we chose 12 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds in Q3 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks. We have used the stock\u2019s Revenue Growth Rate (year-over-year) as a tie-breaker in case two or more stocks have the same number of hedge funds invested. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. ( see more details here ) Air Transport Services Group Inc. (NASDAQ: ATSG ) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 16 Air Transport Services Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATSG), a leading provider of aircraft leasing and air transportation services, specializes in medium wide-body freighter aircraft. Through its varied companies, it provides a distinctive Lease+Plus aircraft leasing possibility within the aviation industry. The North American and European markets account for the majority of the company\u2019s sales. It is among the best airline stocks , having increased by more than 32% so far this year. In the third quarter of 2024, Air Transport Services Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATSG)\u2019s free cash flow improved dramatically, going from a negative $51.6 million to $86.4 million. Operating cash flow increased 15.35% year over year. Additionally, the business declared a final deal to be bought out by alternative investment firm Stonepeak for all cash for about $3.1 billion. Air Transport Services Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATSG)\u2019s leasing division benefited from strong demand, with four Boeing 767-300 freighter leases signed in the third quarter. However, third-quarter profitability was impacted by higher expenses and fewer block hours flown. By the end of 2024, the firm intends to sign three additional leases for freighters owned by CAM and expects significant benefits in its ACMI Services division as a result of contractual price increases. On November 5, 2024, Air Transport Services Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATSG) announced that it had entered into an acquisition agreement with Stonepeak for $22.50 per share. Truist analyst Michael Ciarmoli increased the firm\u2019s price target for the business from $15 to $22.50. In a research note, the analyst informed investors that Stonepeak\u2019s implied take-out multiple for the deal is 20% lower than peers\u2019, but this is likely justified given recent operating performance, pilot union contract unknowns, and greater exposure to older freighter platforms as opposed to newer passenger variant aircraft. John Osterweis\u2019s Osterweis Capital Management was the largest stakeholder in the company from among the funds in Insider Monkey\u2019s database at the end of Q3 2024. It owns 29 million shares worth $29.80 million as of Q3. Overall, ATSG ranks 10th on our list of the best aviation stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of ATSG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Air Transport Services Group, Inc Price and EPS Surprise Air Transport Services Group, Inc Price and EPS Surprise Air Transport Services Group, Inc price-eps-surprise | Air Transport Services Group, Inc Quote The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s soon-to-be-reported quarter\u2019s earnings has remained flat at 19 cents per share in the past 60 days. Air Transport Services Group\u2019s top-line performance is expected to have been bolstered by an increased demand scenario in the September-end quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $509.8 million, which indicates a rise of 4.4% from third-quarter 2023 actuals. Our estimate for ACMI (aircraft, crew, maintenance, and insurance) Services indicates an increase of 4.2% quarter over quarter, while cargo aircraft management (CAM) is anticipated at $110.9 million. The company\u2019s robust cost-cutting initiatives are also expected to have boosted its bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter. What Our Model Says Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Air Transport Services Group this time. The combination of a positive\u00a0Earnings ESP\u00a0and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here. Air Transport Services Group has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our\u00a0Earnings ESP Filter.
