Earnings per share increased by 19.1% to $1.12 in Q4 2024, up from $0.94 in Q3. The company repurchased 506,651 shares of common stock, indicating strong capital management. Total core deposits increased by 16.7% annualized, driven by seasonal factors and marketing activities. The tier one leverage capital ratio improved to 10.97% as of December 31, 2024, reflecting a strong capital position. Negative Points Total deposits decreased by $258 million or 5.3% annualized during Q4 2024, primarily due to a decrease in broker deposits. Net charge-offs increased significantly to $16.3 million in Q4 2024, compared to $4.2 million in Q3. Nonaccrual loans rose to 0.83% of total loans, with a notable increase due to a $16 million CRE loan reclassified as nonaccrual. The reserve to loan ratio decreased to 0.83% for Q4 from 0.85% in Q3, indicating a slight reduction in loan loss reserves. Noninterest income decreased by $4.9 million in Q4 2024, primarily due to changes in market-to-market and realized gains. Q & A Highlights Q : Could you give us the average margin for December and the spot rate on deposits at the end of the year? A : The average margin for December was 3.11%, including six basis points of interest recoveries. The total weighted spot rate at year-end was 3.52% for interest-bearing deposits. - Heng Chen, CFO Q : How much in CDs do you have maturing in the first quarter, and what are the expected renewal rates? A : We have 4.2 billion in CDs maturing from our Chinese Lunar New Year promotion, with an average yield of 4.6%. We are offering renewals at rates between 4% and 4.1%, depending on the deposit size. - Heng Chen, CFO Q : Can you provide more details on the core expense growth of roughly 5%? A : The increase is mainly due to the full-year impact of staff additions in 2024 and higher bonus accruals for next year. We've been adding staff to the risk side of our business to meet regulatory expectations. - Heng Chen, CFO and Chang Liu, CEO Q : What is the impact of the wildfires on your credit exposure? A : We have assessed the affected areas and found no loss reported in our commercial real estate, business banking, or SBA portfolios. There are some reported items in the C&I portfolio and a few mortgages and HELOCs, but these are small compared to our total mortgage assets. - Chang Liu, CEO Story Continues Q : What are your thoughts on capital deployment, specifically regarding M&A interest in 2025? A : We are open to M&A opportunities, especially in our niche market. However, the potential targets in Texas and New York are usually small and may not significantly impact our base. We will consider opportunities that are accretive and strategically beneficial. - Chang Liu, CEO For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .

INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW FOURTH QUARTER 2024 COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER 2024 Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, was $80.2 million, an increase of $12.7 million, or 18.8%, compared to net income of $67.5 million for the third quarter of 2024. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $1.12 per share compared to $0.94 per share for the third quarter of 2024. Return on average stockholders\u2019 equity was 11.18% and return on average assets was 1.37% for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, compared to a return on average stockholders\u2019 equity of 9.50% and a return on average assets of 1.15% in the third quarter of 2024. Net interest income before provision for credit losses Net interest income before provision for credit losses increased $1.8 million, or 1.1%, to $171.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $169.2 million in the third quarter of 2024. The increase was due primarily to a decrease in interest deposit expense, partially offset by a decrease in interest income from loans and securities. Story Continues The net interest margin was 3.07% for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to 3.04% for the third quarter of 2024. For the fourth quarter of 2024, the yield on average interest-earning assets was 5.92%, the cost of funds on average interest-bearing liabilities was 3.75%, and the cost of average interest-bearing deposits was 3.72%. In comparison, for the third quarter of 2024, the yield on average interest-earning assets was 6.10%, the cost of funds on average interest-bearing liabilities was 3.99%, and the cost of average interest-bearing deposits was 3.95%. The decrease in the yield on average interest-bearing liabilities resulted mainly from lower interest rates on deposits driven by the lower repricing of maturing time deposits in the fourth quarter. The decrease in the yield on average interest-earning assets resulted mainly from lower interest rates on loans due to the decreasing rate environment. The net interest spread, defined as the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and the cost of funds on average interest-bearing liabilities, was 2.17% for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to 2.11% for the third quarter of 2024. Provision for credit losses The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $14.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $14.5 million in the third quarter of 2024. As of December 31, 2024, the allowance for credit losses decreased by $1.9 million to $171.4 million, or 0.88% of gross loans, compared to $173.2 million, or 0.89% of gross loans as of September 30, 2024.

citations despite ballot challenge Pioneer Press, St. Paul, Minn. \u00b7 John Autey/Pioneer Press/TNS Frederick Melo, Pioneer Press Updated Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 2:09 AM 7 min read When the U.S. Department of Justice took a hard look in 2015 at the municipal fines and fees issued by Ferguson, Mo., officials uncovered some difficult truths. Nearly a fourth of the city budget rested on fining individuals, many of them local residents and the vast majority of them Black. Ferguson, a high-poverty community, issued some 90,000 summonses and citations in a single year. The city\u2019s population at the time was 21,000 people. As the St. Paul City Council prepares to vote on amending the city charter to allow for non-criminal fines and administrative citations , Ferguson looms large as a negative precedent for some critics worried that future penalties will come down hardest on those with the least ability to pay. They\u2019re eager to see guardrails preventing cash-strapped city departments from balancing their books through fines over mundane concerns like tall weeds and chipped paint. \u201cWhat is going to happen to poor folks and BIPOC folks if they get caught up in one of these fines?\u201d said Caty Royce, a co-director of the Frogtown Neighborhood Association, addressing the city council last Wednesday. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to pass this \u2014 and it sounds like a lot of folks are in support of it \u2014 it has to have a tool, whether it\u2019s a fund that\u2019s put together that (supports) folks that cannot afford this, or some safety measures. \u2026 There are equity issues .\u201d Amendment looks likely to be approved Years in the making and supported by all seven council members, the proposed charter amendment looks likely to be approved by the city council on Wednesday, but that may not be the final word. Peter Butler, a former council candidate and frequent critic of City Hall, said he and likeminded peers plan to collect 2,000 voter signatures with the intent of freezing the charter amendment and forcing it onto the public ballot next November. He\u2019ll have 60 days from the time of the council vote to get his signatures in. \u201cYou\u2019re overselling this idea of civil penalties,\u201d Butler told the council Wednesday. \u201cThe idea that these civil penalties are going to inspire changes in behavior, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Council Member Anika Bowie said her childhood home had been temporarily boarded by the city in her youth for falling below code. With those memories in mind, she had listened to all sides of the debate and reached out to the nonprofit Fines and Fees Justice Center, which is based in New York City, to consider \u201ca process that treats people with dignity, justice and protection.\u201d Story Continues Rather than vote against a charter amendment, she said she planned to propose a resolution to support an advisory group \u2014 a \u201ccommunity equity body\u201d \u2014 to review how citations are structured, and to use the city\u2019s new Reparations Commission to incorporate fines and fees into a historical analysis of city practices with negative racial impacts, dubbed a \u201charm report.\u201d She also proposes a fund \u201censuring that fines and fees can\u2019t be used as a city revenue generator\u201d and are instead collected to help everyday residents comply with city standards. Administrative fines have \u201cunintended consequences,\u201d acknowledged Bowie, noting community leaders in the wards she represents \u2014 Frogtown and Summit-University \u2014 are opposed to them. \u201cThose unintended consequences are real. It\u2019s been well studied. We\u2019ve seen them across the country. \u2026 As someone raised in Rondo, I have seen the devastation when someone didn\u2019t have the means to meet our city\u2019s codes.\u201d Worker, renter groups urge approval In all, 24 of the 25 largest cities in Minnesota \u2014 including Minneapolis, Woodbury and Brooklyn Center \u2014 allow their city councils to impose non-criminal fines on those who violate city ordinances. St. Paul does not, though that will change if the charter is amended and the council is granted the power to begin altering individual ordinances to add administrative penalties. During a public hearing before the city council last week, a long line of city residents and representatives of worker and renter advocacy groups took the microphone to encourage the seven council members to do just that. Administrative citations have won the support of ISAIAH, the St. Paul Regional Labor Federation, SEIU Healthcare Minnesota & Iowa, Sustain St. Paul and Unidos St. Paul, all of whom urged the council members on Wednesday to vote for the charter change. \u201cPrivate contractors working on our streets just block them off, set up obstructions, and the city has very little power to stop them,\u201d said Rick Varco, a political director with SEIU Healthcare and chair of the St. Paul Charter Commission . \u201cIt\u2019s a real problem. \u2026 This is a real solution. In fact, it\u2019s the solution most cities have.\u201d Testifiers also shared stories of menacing or absentee landlords who failed to maintain properties , and self-serving employers who ignored city regulations around paid sick leave. Several speakers recounted how out-of-state property owners take advantage of them and their friends or family. The likelihood of hiring an attorney to take on a sizable corporation over a few hundred dollars in pay or services seemed unrealistic. Tonette Clardy, a small business owner who is active in the faith-based organization ISAIAH, told the city council that she and her neighbors have long expressed frustration about a vacant property in the area recently condemned. \u201cCurrently, there are too many examples where the city of St. Paul is left with two options,\u201d Clardy said. \u201cIt\u2019s either inaction, or charging someone with a (criminal) misdemeanor. These are too extreme to address the situation in my neighborhood. I don\u2019t want the owner to be jailed, but I do want him to be held accountable. I also don\u2019t want the violators of laws, especially those of color, to be on a path toward over-penalization or criminalization.\u201d Still, some neighborhood advocates remain skeptical that granting the council citation power will work out as planned. Jens Werner, executive director of the Summit-University Planning Council, said the city\u2019s Department of Safety and Inspections and its complaint-based summary abatement orders already penalize homeowners in the lower-income Rondo area more so than in neighboring Cathedral Hill, which is wealthier. Patricia Hartmann, an attorney and former council candidate, predicted critics will collect enough voter signatures to take the charter amendment to the November ballot. \u201cYou\u2019re just going to add a big burden to the people of this city to pay for a whole lot more city jobs, to try to duplicate a court system \u2026 that has really good rules of evidence and doesn\u2019t allow hearsay,\u201d Hartmann said. \u201cJust get yourself a good lawyer. \u2026 This should be done by a popular vote.\u201d Council members are on board To amend the charter, the seven-member council must be unanimous. All of the council members last Wednesday spoke in favor of an amendment, noting each ordinance change creating administrative penalties would have to go through its own individual hearing process. City Council President Mitra Jalali said the intent was \u201cto go after the worst actors\u201d and \u201csome of the biggest, most faceless, out-of-state corporate landlords and employers who will not even show face to a public hearing. \u2026 This is about the big guys. This is about making them pay.\u201d Jalali said civil penalties would go through an \u201cability to pay\u201d review ensuring institutions pay larger fines than everyday residents and \u201cthe fines were proportionate to the actor.\u201d \u201cWhat we heard today is just so many examples of why residents in our city \u2014 especially and disproportionately lower-income, working class people of color \u2014 need the city on their side to defend their paycheck, to defend their home, to make sure the habitability and safety of their residents are taken care of,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd with that, we need to make an equity plan for implementation.\u201d Related Articles Local News | MnDOT officially recommends dropping two at-grade options for rethinking I-94 Local News | St. Paul: LaNoire Bridal to receive $100,000 HRA loan to move into space at 7th and Wabasha Local News | Letters: This may have some impact on cheap shots on the ice Local News | St. Paul trash rates went up about $50 on Jan. 1.

2025, 6:00 PM 5 min read The market expects Western Alliance (WAL) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates. The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This bank holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.92 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +0.5%. Revenues are expected to be $817.22 million, up 18.2% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.42% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change. Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction). The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Story Continues Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Western Alliance? For Western Alliance, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.09%. On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3. So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Western Alliance will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue? While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Western Alliance would post earnings of $1.90 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.80, delivering a surprise of -5.26%. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times. Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Western Alliance doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release. Expected Results of an Industry Player Among the stocks in the Zacks Banks - West industry, Cathay General (CATY) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.11 per share for the quarter ended December 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -11.2%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $185 million, down 9.9% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus EPS estimate for Cathay has been revised 3.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.79%. When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cathay will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.

Earnings on the Horizon: Analysts' Insights on Key Performance Measures Zacks Equity Research Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 5:15 PM 2 min read Wall Street analysts expect Cathay General (CATY) to post quarterly earnings of $1.11 per share in its upcoming report, which indicates a year-over-year decline of 11.2%. Revenues are expected to be $185 million, down 9.9% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has undergone a downward revision of 3.1% in the past 30 days, bringing it to its present level. This represents how the covering analysts, as a whole, have reassessed their initial estimates during this timeframe. Prior to a company's earnings announcement, it is crucial to consider revisions to earnings estimates. This serves as a significant indicator for predicting potential investor actions regarding the stock. Empirical research has consistently demonstrated a robust correlation between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock. While investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as a yardstick to evaluate the company's quarterly performance, scrutinizing analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics can offer a more comprehensive perspective. That said, let's delve into the average estimates of some Cathay metrics that Wall Street analysts commonly model and monitor. Analysts' assessment points toward 'Efficiency Ratio' reaching 44.7%. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 53.8% in the same quarter of the previous year. It is projected by analysts that the 'Net Interest Margin' will reach 3.0%. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of 3.3%. According to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Average balance - Total interest-earning assets' should come in at $22.18 billion. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $22.07 billion in the same quarter last year. Based on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Net interest income before provision for loan losses' should arrive at $169.32 million. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of $182.14 million. The collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Total Non-Interest Income' of $14.50 million. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of $23.10 million.

Cathay General (CATY) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 6:00 PM 5 min read In This Article: CATY -1.96% Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Cathay General (CATY) reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates. The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 22. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This holding company for Cathay Bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.11 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -11.2%. Revenues are expected to be $185 million, down 9.9% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.11% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change. Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Story Continues Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cathay? For Cathay, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.79%. On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3. So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cathay will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue? While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Cathay would post earnings of $0.98 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.97, delivering a surprise of -1.02%. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times. Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Cathay doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release. An Industry Player's Expected Results RBB (RBB), another stock in the Zacks Banks - West industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.36 for the quarter ended December 2024. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -16.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $28.18 million, down 14.8% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus EPS estimate for RBB has been revised 2.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.69%. When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that RBB will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.
