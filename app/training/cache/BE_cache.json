Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Courtney Carlsen, The Motley Fool Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 12:05 PM 5 min read In This Article: BE MSFT As artificial intelligence (AI) advances and its applications expand across various sectors, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and manufacturing, the need for reliable energy solutions to power data centers is becoming increasingly urgent. Many companies are actively seeking scalable renewable energy sources to address this challenge and support their growing requirements. This is where Bloom Energy (NYSE: BE) has an opportunity. With its innovative fuel cell technology, it is capable of meeting technology companies' energy needs today -- not five or 10 years down the road. The company recently secured a massive agreement that could foreshadow more significant deals, and the stock has surged by an impressive 149% since November. Recently, though, the stock has fallen by 17% from its 52-week high, and trades below $28 per share as I write this. Is it a buy today? How Bloom Energy can meet the growing demand for energy The quick uptake in the use of AI technology has led to a significant increase in the demand for energy from the data centers that support this software. Goldman Sachs forecasts that data center power demand will increase at an annualized rate of 15% through 2030. That would leave data centers responsible for roughly 8% of the total power consumption in the United States. Technology companies are actively seeking solutions to accommodate their data centers' increasing energy consumption. In September, Microsoft entered into a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy that will bring Three Mile Island's Unit 1 nuclear reactor back online. Fuel cells could also help meet this growing need. For instance, Bloom's solid oxide fuel cell technology efficiently converts renewable fuel sources like biogas and hydrogen without combustion. It provides dependable, low-carbon energy, and microgrid solutions for clients that need resilient power. A significant advantage that Bloom has over some other emerging energy companies is that its technology is ready to deploy today. It can be implemented for clients in just 50 days, and used to complement the energy supplied by the power grid. Furthermore, this technology allows data centers to function independently as \"islands,\" eliminating their dependence on the electric grid -- making it an especially attractive option for energy-intensive AI businesses. Bloom has made serious headway in the past year Since the company went public in 2018, it has struggled financially. In the last year, Bloom Energy incurred losses of nearly $130 million against total revenues of $1.25 billion. Although it has improved its margins, securing additional large clients will be essential to further validate its offerings and move the company toward positive cash flow. Over the past year, it has done just that. Story Continues In May, the company announced a power purchase agreement with Intel to install additional megawatts of its fuel cell-based Energy Server at Intel's high-performance computing data center in Santa Clara, California. In July, it partnered with the Nvidia -backed AI hyperscaler CoreWeave to generate on-site power for its high-performance data center in Illinois. Image source: Bloom Energy. In November, American Electric Power signed an agreement to purchase up to 1 gigawatt (GW) of solid-state fuel cells from Bloom Energy for data centers and other large commercial and industrial applications. Evercore , an investment bank, described this development as a \"big win\" for the company, while Morningstar called it \"a potential game changer for Bloom.\" Following the deal, analysts at Morgan Stanley raised their EBITDA estimates for Bloom by 35% for 2025 and 62% for 2026, anticipating that the order will be filled over the next four years. Is Bloom a buy? As energy demand grows, Bloom Energy looks particularly appealing because its products are ready to deploy today. Contrast this with traditional nuclear power plants, which take years to construct and bring online, and small modular nuclear reactors, which may not be ready for commercial deployment until the 2030s. Bloom Energy is making solid progress, and its partnership with American Electric will help it showcase its ability to provide quick, scalable energy solutions. It also puts Bloom in a prime position with a utility client that has forecast a 20% annual growth in its commercial load over the next three years. Analysts covering the stock expect that Bloom could report earnings of $0.06 per share in 2024, and project that could grow to $0.43 per share in 2025. There are risks here for investors if new deals fail to materialize or if the deal with American Electric Power -- which isn't a firm order -- fails to meet expectations. For that reason, this up-and-coming energy stock isn't suitable for conservative investors. That said, Bloom has made solid progress and will look to build on its momentum in 2025, making it a good growth stock pick for long-term investors willing to tolerate some risk.

compiled a list of the Why These 15 Stocks Are Skyrocketing in 2025 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bloom Energy Corporation (NYSE:BE) stands against the other stocks. Stock gains always get people talking, and 2025 is no exception. Markets have moved higher for a while due to a shift toward tech innovation. The pace might slow after two years of significant returns, but investors have regained their confidence after the Stargate project was announced. Small and mid-sized companies have started to pick up pace recently and are landing on investors\u2019 radars as mega-cap stocks are now trading at nosebleed valuations. These companies have higher growth potential than their mega-cap rivals, and that explains the sudden surge of interest. Smaller and mid-tier stocks did face challenges in prior years when corrections and interest rate hikes weighed on market sentiment. However, now that inflation seems more contained and Trump pushes for more rate cuts, things look even better for these mid-sized stocks. Methodology For this article, I screened the top-performing stocks year-to-date in the $5 billion to $20 billion market capitalization bracket. Stocks that I have covered recently will be excluded from this list. I will also mention the number of hedge fund investors in these stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. ( see more details here ). Bloom Energy Corporation (BE) Sees Wall Street Price Target Raised Amid Data Center Demand A bird's eye view of a power generation platform with a power plant in the background. Bloom Energy Corporation (NYSE: BE ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 25 Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE) is a renewable energy company that provides solid oxide fuel cell systems. It can run on various fuels, and its customers include data center companies. BE stock is up significantly year-to-date due to a major deal with American Electric Power for 1 gigawatt of Bloom\u2019s fuel cell products. The first order includes 100 megawatts for AI data centers. More orders will likely follow in 2025. Analysts have also raised price targets due to the growth opportunity here, especially when it comes to data centers and cloud computing. Bloom also has a collaboration with SK Ecoplant in South Korea that could fuel more growth due to its focus on large-scale fuel cell deployments. Story Continues The company is still unprofitable, but there have been solid margin improvements here. COGS has been reduced, and the gross margin has increased. Analysts have a consensus price target of $24.5, implying 16.6% downside risk. That said, price targets are likely to be raised more. BE stock is up 25.6% year-to-date. Overall BE ranks 13th on our list of the stocks that are skyrocketing in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of BE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock .

Stock Crashed More Than 25% Today Neha Chamaria, The Motley Fool Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 9:51 PM 3 min read In This Article: BE Shares of Bloom Energy (NYSE: BE) plunged today, crashing as much as 28.6% through noon ET Monday. Ironically, an analyst just upgraded the green hydrogen stock with a price target that would mean a near-11% upside from Friday's closing price. But this morning's crash alone means the analyst's price target now represents a staggering 50% potential upside in Bloom Energy stock as its current price, as of this writing. Analyst favors Bloom Energy stock... Piper Sandler analyst Kashy Harrison upped Bloom Energy stock's price target to $33 per share from $30 a share. In a recent report from Bloom Energy, the company predicted that 55 gigawatts (GW) of artificial intelligence (AI) data center capacity could come online in the U.S. alone over the next five years, opening up big opportunities for Bloom Energy, which uses solid oxide fuel cells to build a modular power-generation platform that can provide constant on-site power. Harrison sees merit in Bloom Energy's prediction and believes the company is \"well positioned\" to outperform in 2025, driven by data center power demand, among other things. Harrison also believes Wall Street's conservative outlook on Bloom Energy means management could even revise its guidance for the company over time. So why is Bloom Energy crashing today? A rival stock just got a ratings downgrade, uncertainty for clean energy companies under President Donald Trump looms large, and any company that has any relation with AI has seen its stock plunge today. ...but investors are scared Seaport Global Securities analyst Tom Curran downgraded Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG) stock's rating to a sell, with a price target of only $1 per share, translating into a more than 50% downside from the stock's Friday closing price. Although Curran is worried about Plug Power's business strategy, the analyst also cited several macro factors behind the ratings downgrade, including Trump's freeze on the disbursal of funds awarded by the Biden administration for the green hydrogen industry. Meanwhile, major U.S. stock market indexes plunged today after Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek 's advanced yet far cheaper AI model rattled U.S. tech giants that have been spending billions of dollars on AI data centers. Bloom Energy stock couldn't have escaped the market rout today, since AI data centers in the U.S. also happens to be the most important growth market for the company.
