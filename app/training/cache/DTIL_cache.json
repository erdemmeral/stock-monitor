- Treatment with ECUR-506 resulted in a complete clinical response from three months post exposure to the end of study (six months post exposure) - ECUR-506 was generally well tolerated with no significant clinical safety concerns - Insertion of a functional OTC gene through ARCUS in vivo gene editing may provide lasting clinical benefit for children with OTC deficiency who are in dire need of effective treatments DURHAM, N.C., January 09, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Precision BioSciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: DTIL), a clinical stage gene editing company utilizing its novel proprietary ARCUS\u00ae platform to develop in vivo gene editing therapies for sophisticated gene edits, including gene insertion, excision, and elimination, today announced that its partner iECURE has reported clinical efficacy and safety data in the first patient dosed with ECUR-506 in the Phase 1/2 OTC-HOPE study. ECUR-506 is iECURE\u2019s in vivo gene insertion program designed to treat neonatal onset Ornithine Transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency utilizing a PCSK9-specific ARCUS nuclease, licensed from Precision, that enables insertion of a functional copy of the OTC gene. \"Congratulations to iECURE for these exciting results and initial clinical validation in the first infant dosed in their OTC-HOPE trial. These results showcase that a complete clinical response can be achieved through in vivo gene editing for children born with this devastating genetic disease,\" said Michael Amoroso, Chief Executive Officer of Precision BioSciences. \"The data increases our confidence in the therapeutic potential of ARCUS as a novel in vivo gene editing approach for patients who have been and plan to be treated in clinical trials by Precision and partners.\" Treatment with ECUR-506, which employs an ARCUS\u00ae nuclease licensed from Precision BioSciences, was generally well tolerated in this infant with no significant clinical safety concerns apart from asymptomatic transaminitis at four weeks. The asymptomatic transaminitis was managed with immunosuppressive therapy and resolved within four weeks. Twelve weeks after a single dose of ECUR-506, ammonia scavenger medication was discontinued and mean daily protein intake was increased to age-appropriate levels. Protein liberalization was well tolerated, and the subsequent mean ammonia level remained within normal limits and was reduced compared to the mean pretreatment level. The response was maintained through six months and indicates that a complete response was achieved in this patient. The OTC-HOPE study is ongoing in the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, and Spain, and iECURE expects to finish enrollment in 2025 and provide complete data for the program in the first half of 2026. Story Continues Precision\u2019s ELIMINATE-B trial for PBGENE-HBV is ongoing in chronic hepatitis B in Moldova, Hong Kong and New Zealand with Phase 1 data expected in 2025. About Precision BioSciences, Inc. Precision BioSciences, Inc. is a clinical stage gene editing company dedicated to improving life (DTIL) with its novel and proprietary ARCUS\u00ae genome editing platform that differs from other technologies in the way it cuts, its smaller size, and its simpler structure. Key capabilities and differentiating characteristics may enable ARCUS nucleases to drive more intended, defined therapeutic outcomes. Using ARCUS, Precision\u2019s pipeline is comprised of in vivo gene editing candidates designed to deliver lasting cures for the broadest range of genetic and infectious diseases such as chronic hepatitis B where no adequate treatments exist. About ECUR-506 iECURE\u2019s approach to gene editing for its initial programs, including OTC deficiency, relies on the delivery of two adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, each carrying different payloads. ECUR-506 comprises two vectors, an ARCUS\u00ae nuclease vector targeting gene editing in the well-characterized PCSK9 gene locus and a donor vector that inserts the desired functional OTC gene. iECURE has licensed the ARCUS nuclease for ECUR-506 from Precision BioSciences. The cut in the PCSK9 site serves as the insertion site for the OTC gene, providing a potential path to permanent expression of a functional gene. ECUR-506 is being studied in the OTC-HOPE study, the first clinical ARCUS-based in vivo gene insertion program. About the OTC-HOPE Study The OTC-HOPE study is a Phase 1/2 first-in-human clinical trial of ECUR-506 in baby boys with genetically confirmed neonatal onset OTC deficiency and will test multiple dose levels of ECUR-506. The study is enrolling newborn males up to seven months of age at screening who are diagnosed with severe neonatal onset OTC deficiency and meet certain other criteria. The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of intravenous administration of a single dose of ECUR-506. It will also assess the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of ECUR-506 administration and the potential effects of ECUR-506 on disease-specific biologic markers, developmental milestones and quality of life. The main study will occur in a series of stages over a 10-month period, including screening, stabilization, dosing eligibility, study drug administration, and six-month follow-up. Upon completion of the OTC-HOPE study, participants transition to the 14.5 year long term follow up study (ECUR-LTFU). For more information, visit https://OTC-HOPE.com . About OTC Deficiency OTC deficiency, the most common urea cycle disorder, is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by a genetic defect in a liver enzyme responsible for the detoxification of ammonia. Individuals with OTC deficiency can build up excessive levels of ammonia in their blood potentially resulting in devastating consequences, including irreversible neurological damage, coma and death. The severe form of the condition emerges shortly after birth and is more common in boys than girls. The only corrective treatment for early onset severe OTC deficiency is a liver transplant. Currently available medical therapies do not correct the disease and do not eliminate the risk of life-threatening symptoms or crises. About iECURE iECURE is a clinical-stage gene editing company focused on developing therapies that utilize mutation-agnostic in vivo gene insertion for the treatment of liver disorders with significant unmet need. iECURE believes their approach has the potential to restore the function of a dysfunctional gene, regardless of mutation, by knocking-in a functional copy of that gene to offer durable gene expression and long-term, potentially curative, therapeutic benefit. iECURE\u2019s management team has extensive experience in executing global orphan drug and gene therapy clinical trials and successfully commercializing multiple products. iECURE intends to leverage their team\u2019s core strength in research and development strategy to identify what they believe to be the most suitable target and modality for their product candidates to address particular liver diseases.

1H 2026 ECUR-506 for neonatal onset OTC deficiency represents a meaningful potential clinical and commercial opportunity, affecting over 1,000 births per year globally PHILADELPHIA, January 09, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- iECURE , Inc. , a gene editing company focused on the development of mutation-agnostic in vivo gene insertion therapies for the treatment of liver disorders with significant unmet need, today reported preliminary findings from the first infant dosed in the ongoing OTC-HOPE Phase 1/2 study of ECUR-506, the company\u2019s clinical candidate designed to treat neonatal onset ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency. Treatment with ECUR-506 was generally well tolerated in this infant with no significant clinical safety concerns apart from asymptomatic transaminitis at four weeks. The asymptomatic transaminitis was managed with immunosuppressive therapy and resolved within four weeks. Twelve weeks after a single dose of ECUR-506, ammonia scavenger medication was discontinued and mean daily protein intake was increased to age-appropriate levels. Protein liberalization was well tolerated, and the subsequent mean ammonia level remained within normal limits and was reduced compared to the mean pretreatment level. iECURE\u2019s approach to gene editing for its initial programs, including OTC deficiency, relies on the delivery of two adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors comprised of the same capsid, but each carrying different payloads. ECUR-506 comprises two vectors, an ARCUS\u00ae nuclease vector targeting gene editing in the well-characterized PCSK9 gene locus and a donor vector that inserts the desired functional OTC gene. iECURE has licensed the ARCUS nuclease for ECUR-506 from Precision BioSciences (Nasdaq: DTIL). 1 The cut in the PCSK9 site serves as the insertion site for the OTC gene, providing a potential path to permanent expression of a functional gene. \"Our team is highly encouraged to see this baby, who after having experienced two spikes in blood ammonia levels before three and a half months of age, reach a point where he no longer needs ammonia scavengers and is eating age-appropriate levels of protein for a baby of his age,\" said Julien Baruteau, M.D., Ph.D., MRC Clinical Scientist Fellow and Group Leader at University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health and Consultant in Metabolic Medicine at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London, and principal investigator in the study. \"Standard of care for babies with neonatal OTC deficiency relies on liver transplantation in infancy, a procedure with significant risks of complications. This novel gene therapy approach might enable bypassing the need for liver transplantation. While this is very early data, I am hopeful that this baby will continue along this encouraging trajectory and that other babies who enroll in this study will have similar experiences. This novel gene therapy technology may herald new avenues to treat babies with severe liver genetic diseases.\" Story Continues OTC deficiency is a serious rare genetic disease wherein ammonia, a waste product that is generated when the body breaks down proteins, builds up in the blood (hyperammonemia). Ammonia is toxic to the brain when it accumulates at high levels. Newborns with neonatal onset OTC deficiency experience symptoms of hyperammonemia shortly after birth, including lethargy, poor suck and vomiting, that if left untreated can quickly escalate to seizures, brain damage, coma and eventual death. Rescuing newborns from their first hyperammonemic crisis (HAC) often requires dialysis and intravenously delivered ammonia scavenger medicines. Once the infant is stabilized, ongoing medical management, including ammonia scavenger dosing and use of a protein-restricted diet, is conducted to protect the brain against further ammonia buildup. Despite medical management, additional HACs can occur leading clinicians to recommend a liver transplantation in the first year of life. While curative, liver transplantation includes risks such as graft failure and an increased risk of malignancy and infection due to prolonged use of immunosuppressive drugs. \"To our knowledge, this is the very first infant to have ever received an in vivo , liver-directed, gene insertion investigational product. While still early days and follow up is limited to the first six months post exposure, the elimination of this baby\u2019s need for the current standard of care observed after a few months of receiving ECUR-506 may represent a historic milestone for children with neonatal OTC deficiency, their families and their care teams. In vivo gene insertion may foretell the future treatment approach for a host of severe, early-onset, genetic conditions and may mark the beginning of a new chapter in the evolution of gene therapy,\" said Gabriel Cohn, M.D., MBA, Chief Medical Officer of iECURE. \"It is important to note that elevations in liver enzymes, particularly ALT, are not uncommon in AAV-mediated gene therapy trials. We have updated the clinical trial protocol to more promptly detect and more aggressively manage this type of event, if needed, in future clinical trial participants.\" Summary of Findings in the First Participant: The first infant dosed with ECUR-506 was initially diagnosed with neonatal onset OTC deficiency following a HAC during the first week of life, and he was stabilized with hemodialysis and managed with standard of care ammonia scavenger medication and protein restriction. Molecular genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis. At 3.5 months of age, while on a protein restricted diet and on scavenger medicine, the participant experienced a breakthrough HAC. At 6.5 months of age, the participant received a single infusion of the lowest dose (1.3 x 10 13 GC/kg) of ECUR-506, which was generally well tolerated. Asymptomatic transaminitis was noted during routine lab testing at four weeks post-ECUR-506 exposure. A liver biopsy was subsequently performed at six-weeks post dosing which confirmed an acute T-cell inflammatory response. By eight weeks post-ECUR 506 exposure, following immunosuppressive therapy management, the grade 3 transaminitis resolved. On the basis of reduced serum glutamine levels, ammonia scavenger medication weaning was initiated with complete discontinuation achieved at 12 weeks post-ECUR-506 dosing. Protein allowance was subsequently increased to the age-appropriate level for infants without OTC deficiency. The participant\u2019s mean ammonia and serum glutamine levels have remained within normal limits, and the participant has not experienced any HAC as of 6 months post treatment. The participant transitioned to the long term follow up study (ECUR-LTFU) for further monitoring. Dosing of cohort 1 (Low Dose) continues and the complete six-month data readout for all patients is anticipated in the first half of 2026. Full study data of the first participant will be presented at the 2025 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) Annual Clinical Genetics Meeting in Los Angeles, California on March 18-22, 2025. \"The current standard of care for infants affected by neonatal onset OTC deficiency leaves significant room for improvement, and should these results hold true for additional participants, we believe there is tremendous potential for our gene editing approach to treat this devastating disease,\" said Joe Truitt, Chief Executive Officer of iECURE. \"These initial findings are encouraging, and in 2025 we look forward to engaging with regulatory agencies on potential accelerated approval pathways, expand the trial locations across the globe and complete the enrollment of the OTC-HOPE trial.\" In addition to reporting these data from the first participant, iECURE also announced updates around clinical trial locations. UCLA Mattel Children's Hospital and Children\u2019s Hospital of Colorado are the first two clinical trial sites in the United States open for enrollment. Also, iECURE has secured Clinical Trial Authorization from the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA) under the EU Clinical Trial Regulation by the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices (AEMPS) and will be working to open additional sites in Spain. About the OTC-HOPE Study The OTC-HOPE study is a Phase 1/2 first-in-human clinical trial of ECUR-506 in baby boys with genetically confirmed neonatal onset OTC deficiency and has been cleared to evaluate ascending dose levels of ECUR-506, if necessary. The study is enrolling newborn males up to seven months of age at screening who are diagnosed with severe neonatal onset OTC deficiency and meet certain other criteria. The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of intravenous administration of a single dose of ECUR-506. It will also assess the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of ECUR-506 administration and the potential effects of ECUR-506 on disease-specific biologic markers, developmental milestones and quality of life. The main study will occur in a series of stages over a 10-month period, including screening, stabilization, dosing eligibility, study drug administration, and six-month follow-up. Upon completion of the OTC-HOPE study, participants transition to the 14.5 year long term follow up study (ECUR-LTFU). For more information, visit https://OTC-HOPE.com .

BioSciences Receives Approval in Hong Kong to Expand PBGENE-HBV Phase 1 ELIMINATE-B Trial for the Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis B Business Wire Wed, Dec 18, 2024, 3:01 PM 10 min read In This Article: DTIL -6.79% - Approval in Hong Kong marks the first clinical trial application clearance of an in vivo gene editing approach for chronic hepatitis B in Hong Kong and the second CTA approval for PBGENE-HBV in 2024 - ELIMINATE-B is a global, multi-site study now actively recruiting patients; expected to report clinical data as it matures throughout 2025 - U.S. investigational new drug (IND) anticipated in 2025 DURHAM, N.C., December 18, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Precision BioSciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: DTIL), a clinical stage gene editing company utilizing its novel proprietary ARCUS\u00ae platform to develop in vivo gene editing therapies for sophisticated gene edits, today announced that it has received Clinical Trial Application (CTA) approval in Hong Kong to study PBGENE-HBV in the ongoing ELIMINATE-B Phase I trial. PBGENE-HBV is Precision\u2019s lead wholly owned in vivo gene editing program designed to cure chronic hepatitis B by eliminating cccDNA, the key source of replicating hepatitis B virus (HBV), and inactivating integrated HBV DNA in hepatocytes. The company is actively recruiting patients for the ELIMINATE-B trial in Moldova and has begun activating a top infectious disease clinical site in Hong Kong as part of its global regulatory and clinical operations strategy. \"We are pleased to receive our second CTA approval for PBGENE-HBV, expanding our ELIMINATE-B trial into a world-class HBV clinical trial site in Hong Kong,\" said Dr. Murray Abramson, Senior Vice President, Head of Clinical Development of Precision BioSciences. \"PBGENE-HBV has been designed to target a viral site that is prevalent across all HBV genotypes, including in Asia, and we believe that this will enable us to evaluate and provide access to as many patients as possible. In addition to Hong Kong, our clinical trial site in Moldova continues to execute as planned, and we look forward to sharing clinical data as it matures throughout 2025.\" \"Over 400,000 individuals in Hong Kong are currently living with chronic hepatitis B, and many patients continue to develop liver cancer or cirrhosis even on existing long-term treatment with standard of care treatments,\" said Dr. MF Yuen, DSc, MD, PhD, Chair Professor of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Li Shu Fan Medical Foundation and Professor in Medicine, The University of Hong Kong. \"By targeting and eliminating covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA, the root cause of the disease, PBGENE-HBV has the potential to completely eliminate the source of viral replication from the body, not just reduce it, which could transform the treatment landscape for patients in Hong Kong and millions of others worldwide. Our field has long searched for a novel way to eliminate the root cause of chronic hepatitis B, the cccDNA, and I look forward to further investigating PBGENE-HBV in clinic.\" Story Continues Through its precision cutting, compact design, and simple structure, PBGENE-HBV is engineered to target the HBV viral genome and drive functional cures for patients with chronic hepatitis B. PBGENE-HBV leverages the ARCUS\u00ae gene editing platform by delivering an ARCUS nuclease-encoding mRNA to the liver via lipid nanoparticles. The ARCUS nuclease specifically cuts a highly conserved sequence in the hepatitis B viral genome and is designed to eliminate the root cause of the disease, cccDNA, and inactivate integrated HBV genomes. The ARCUS platform is derived from a naturally occurring enzyme and has been optimized for over 20 years into a ground-breaking and highly precise gene editing tool. Precision has submitted multiple global clinical trial applications and remains on track for a U.S. IND in 2025 as part of its global Phase 1 regulatory strategy for PBGENE-HBV. The company will provide updates as it receives additional regulatory approvals to begin treating patients in those markets. About Hepatitis B: Hepatitis B is a leading cause of morbidity in the US and death globally, with no curative options currently available for patients. In 2019, despite the availability of approved antiviral therapies, an estimated 300 million people globally and more than 1 million people in the US were estimated to have chronic hepatitis B infection. An estimated 15% to 40% of patients with HBV infections may develop complications, such as cirrhosis, liver failure, or liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma), which account for the majority of HBV-related deaths. Chronic hepatitis B infection is primarily driven by persistence of HBV cccDNA and integration of HBV DNA into the human genome in liver cells, the primary source of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in late-stage disease. Current treatments for patients with HBV infection include agents that result in long-term viral suppression as indicated by reduction of circulating HBV DNA, but these therapies do not eradicate HBV cccDNA, rarely lead to functional cure, and require lifelong administration. About PBGENE-HBV: PBGENE-HBV is a potentially curative approach to treating patients with chronic HBV infection through a highly specific, novel therapeutic approach. PBGENE leverages the ARCUS\u00ae platform and is designed to directly eliminate cccDNA and inactivate integrated HBV DNA with high specificity, potentially leading to functional cures. About Precision BioSciences, Inc. Precision BioSciences, Inc. is a clinical stage gene editing company dedicated to improving life (DTIL) with its novel and proprietary ARCUS\u00ae genome editing platform that differs from other technologies in the way it cuts, its smaller size, and its simpler structure. Key capabilities and differentiating characteristics may enable ARCUS nucleases to drive more intended, defined therapeutic outcomes. Using ARCUS, the Company\u2019s pipeline is comprised of in vivo gene editing candidates designed to deliver lasting cures for the broadest range of genetic and infectious diseases where no adequate treatments exist. For more information about Precision BioSciences, please visit www.precisionbiosciences.com . The ARCUS\u00ae platform is being used to develop in vivo gene editing therapies for sophisticated gene edits, including gene insertion (inserting DNA into gene to cause expression/add function), elimination (removing a genome e.g. viral DNA or mutant mitochondrial DNA), and excision (removing a large portion of a defective gene by delivering two ARCUS nucleases in a single AAV).

GlobalData Thu, Dec 19, 2024, 1:42 PM 2 min read In This Article: DTIL -6.79% Precision BioSciences has gained the approval of its clinical trial application (CTA) in Hong Kong to study PBGENE-HBV, a gene editing programme, in the ELIMINATE-B Phase I trial for curing chronic hepatitis B by targeting covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), the virus's replicative element. The company is currently recruiting subjects in Moldova and has initiated activation of a clinical site in Hong Kong. With its compact design and precision cutting capabilities, PBGENE-HBV specifically targets a highly conserved sequence within the hepatitis B viral genome. It utilises the ARCUS gene editing platform, delivering a nuclease-encoding mRNA to the liver through lipid nanoparticles. This nuclease targets a conserved sequence within the HBV genome, focusing on the elimination of cccDNA and the inactivation of integrated HBV genomes. The ARCUS platform, based on a naturally occurring enzyme, has undergone over two decades of optimisation to become a pioneering gene editing tool. Precision is actively pursuing a global regulatory and clinical operations strategy, having submitted multiple trial applications worldwide. The company is on track to file a new US investigational drug application (IND) next year as part of its Phase I regulatory strategy for the therapy. It will continue to provide updates on additional regulatory approvals and the commencement of individual treatment in various markets. Precision BioSciences Clinical Development head and senior vice-president Dr Murray Abramson said: \u201cWe are pleased to receive our second CTA approval for PBGENE-HBV, expanding our ELIMINATE-B trial into a world-class HBV clinical trial site in Hong Kong. \u201cPBGENE-HBV has been designed to target a viral site that is prevalent across all HBV genotypes, including in Asia, and we believe that this will enable us to evaluate and provide access to as many patients as possible. In addition to Hong Kong, our clinical trial site in Moldova continues to execute as planned, and we look forward to sharing clinical data as it matures throughout 2025.\u201d \"Precision gains CTA approval in Hong Kong for chronic hepatitis B therapy trial\" was originally created and published by Clinical Trials Arena , a GlobalData owned brand.

BUSINESS WIRE )--Precision BioSciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: DTIL), a clinical stage gene editing company utilizing its novel proprietary ARCUS\u00ae platform to develop in vivo gene editing therapies for sophisticated gene edits, today will present preclinical data supporting the advancement of PBGENE-HBV into clinical development. The Company will also outline the design of its first-in-human study, ELIMINATE-B, in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Company management will present these updates and host panel discussions on the unmet need in chronic hepatitis B and the approach to treatment with PBGENE-HBV during a virtual event being held today, November 15, 10:00 a.m. EST / 7:00 a.m. PST before commencement of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Meeting. \"We are excited to share the preclinical data supporting PBGENE-HBV alongside the design of our Phase 1 trial, ELIMINATE-B, which will be the first clinical study of an in vivo gene editing program in chronic hepatitis B,\" said Michael Amoroso, Chief Executive Officer, Precision BioSciences. \"Chronic hepatitis B affects approximately 300 million people globally and represents a multi-billion-dollar market with chronic treatments currently serving more than 5 million patients worldwide. However, most available treatments for chronic hepatitis B target downstream aspects of the viral lifecycle, leaving the root of disease intact. Consequently, less than 3% of patients treated with existing approved treatments achieve a functional cure. This is unacceptable considering that up to 40% of patients with chronic hepatitis B will progress to develop life-threatening liver disease or liver cancer. PBGENE-HBV is uniquely designed to address this unmet need at the source of viral replication.\" \"Our preclinical results reflect the robust data package submitted to regulators in support of our global Phase 1 trial and underscore our conviction in PBGENE-HBV, which has so far demonstrated compelling safety and selectivity, highly efficient editing, and confirmation of its mechanism to eliminate cccDNA and viral DNA integrated into hepatocytes,\" said Murray Abramson, M.D., M.P.H., Head of Clinical Development, Precision BioSciences. \"Importantly, the ELIMINATE-B study will evaluate patients who are controlled but not cured by nucleoside analogues. We believe ELIMINATE-B will highlight the differentiated mechanism of PBGENE-HBV. By simultaneously targeting the two distinct drivers of disease \u2013 cccDNA and viral DNA integrated into hepatocytes \u2013 PBGENE-HBV has the potential to deliver a much-needed functional cure for people living with chronic hepatitis B.\" Story Continues Mr. Amoroso added, \"With regulatory authorization in place and global sites coming online, we are excited to begin dosing patients with PBGENE-HBV and look forward to sharing clinical data as it matures in 2025.\" PBGENE-HBV Preclinical Data Highlights: Today, Precision will present preclinical data generated to date, which support the progression of PBGENE-HBV into a first-in-human clinical trial. The Company will share robust safety, tolerability, and efficacy signals observed through an array of preclinical models. Key highlights are as follows: Safety and Tolerability: Comprehensive off-target analysis demonstrated a high degree of specificity for PBGENE-HBV, with no increased risks of translocations or integrations in HBV-infected human liver cells; PBGENE-HBV was well tolerated over multiple administrations in mice and non-human primates (NHPs), with rapid clearance after each dose administration, transient transaminase elevations which resolved rapidly, and non-adverse changes in blood parameters; PBGENE-HBV does not distribute to germ cells, as evidenced by NHP studies; and PBGENE-HBV\u2019s high-quality mRNA and optimized LNP formulation contributed to a compelling safety profile. Efficacy: PBGENE-HBV effectively distributed to all hepatocytes in the liver; PBGENE-HBV demonstrated 99% viral DNA editing in NHPs; Confirmed PBGENE-HBV\u2019s dual mechanism with elimination of cccDNA observed in primary human hepatocyte, mouse, and NHP models and inactivation of integrated HBV DNA observed in transgenic mouse models and HBV cell lines; and Observed sustained declines in key viral biomarkers, HBV DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), indicative of a functional cure in transgenic mouse models following administration of PBGENE-HBV and nucleoside analogue withdrawal. Based on these data, Precision has submitted clinical trial applications to authorities in multiple geographies and has so far received clearance to initiate its Phase 1 study in Moldova. Additional regulatory applications are under review or planned for other jurisdictions, including a U.S. IND. ELIMINATE-B Phase 1 Trial Design and Overview: ELIMINATE-B is a global, multi-site, Phase 1 clinical trial, which will evaluate up to 45 HBV patients that are hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative and virologically suppressed on nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs). Since greater than 80% of patients with chronic hepatitis B are HbeAg-negative, this represents the majority of patients with hepatitis B. The ELIMINATE-B trial is targeted for enrollment of 45 patients in up to five countries and will progress in two stages: (1) a staggered, multiple ascending dose cohort, deploying a standard 3+3 design with each patient receiving up to 3 dose administrations; and (2) a dose expansion cohort once the appropriate dose and schedule has been determined. The key safety endpoint of the trial will be frequency and severity of dose-limiting toxicities. Efficacy will be determined by antiviral activity throughout finite duration PBGENE-HBV treatment and follow-up, including reduction in HBsAg, sustained HBV DNA negativity, and discontinuation of standard-of-care nucleos(t)ide analogues. ELIMINATE-B is open and currently screening and accruing patients, and Precision expects to report data from the study as it matures throughout 2025. Further details on the trial can be found in the event slides posted on Precision\u2019s website in the Investors section under Events & Presentations at investor.precisionbiosciences.com and on clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT06680232. Investor Event Webcast Information: Precision\u2019s investor event will include presentations by management on the preclinical data for PBGENE-HBV and the design of ELIMINATE-B. Panel discussions will feature leading hepatitis experts and Precision Scientific Advisory Board members on the market opportunity in HBV, and investigators on their clinical experience treating HBV and the potential for PBGENE-HBV to address this unmet need. The event will be webcast live on Friday, November 15, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. EST / 7:00 a.m. PST.

An archived replay of the webcast will be available for approximately 30 days following the event. About Precision BioSciences, Inc. Precision BioSciences, Inc. is a clinical stage gene editing company dedicated to improving life (DTIL) with its novel and proprietary ARCUS\u00ae genome editing platform that differs from other technologies in the way it cuts, its smaller size, and its simpler structure. Key capabilities and differentiating characteristics may enable ARCUS nucleases to drive more intended, defined therapeutic outcomes. Using ARCUS, the Company\u2019s pipeline is comprised of in vivo gene editing candidates designed to deliver lasting cures for the broadest range of genetic and infectious diseases where no adequate treatments exist. Precision BioSciences is currently enrolling patients in the ELIMINATE-B Phase 1 trial evaluating PBGENE-HBV in patients with chronic hepatitis B. For more information on the ELIMINATE-B trial, please visit clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT06680232. For more information about Precision BioSciences, please visit www.precisionbiosciences.com . The ARCUS\u00ae platform is being used to develop in vivo gene editing therapies for sophisticated gene edits, including gene insertion (inserting DNA into a gene to cause expression/add function), elimination (removing a genome, e.g., viral DNA or mutant mitochondrial DNA), and excision (removing a large portion of a defective gene by delivering two ARCUS nucleases in a single AAV).
