The Maryland Student Venture Showcase and Pava LaPere Innovation Awards exemplify TEDCO's goal to uplift Maryland's entrepreneurial innovation ecosystem.

We know from experience that early-stage support, meaningful connections, and wrap-around support are just as crucial as funding, and we're committed to ensuring they have everything they need to succeed.\" Each of the nine awardees will have the opportunity to present their companies at the Maryland Student Venture Showcase scheduled for Tuesday, February 18, 2025 , from 5:00-9:00 PM at 4MLK.

Affan Mir Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 9:14 PM 4 min read In This Article: DRIO +1.61% We recently published a list of Complete List of All AI Companies Under $2 Billion Market Cap . In this article, we are going to take a look at where DarioHealth Corp. (NASDAQ:DRIO)stands against other AI companies under $2 billion market cap. It\u2019s clear that AI holds immense promise but it comes with significant risks. Some of the concerns that the market has include overreliance on a few key players, shifts in demand toward smaller competitors, and the broader impact of AI-driven market trends on earnings and valuations. While AI offers opportunities, managing risks such as customer concentration, economic headwinds, and market volatility will be crucial for its sustainable growth and integration. Navigating AI Expectations and Market Dynamics On CNBC \u2018Fast Money,\u2019 a discussion between traders highlighted concerns about elevated expectations for AI, especially in the chip market, with NVDA as a prime example. Past patterns in the semiconductor giant\u2019s stock suggest potential declines, with customer concentration being a significant risk. Some believe demand for high-end chips could shift to smaller semiconductor companies. They also discussed that broader market performance might improve as other sectors gain traction, especially during earnings season, which is expected to influence investor sentiment more than AI and GLP-1 trends. They mentioned that the key risks for earnings include the strong U.S. dollar, rising rates, and policy uncertainties, which may impact large-cap companies. While recent PPI data offered some relief, the bond market remains firm, with 10-year yields approaching 5%. Expectations for CPI and PCE figures are mixed, with potential reacceleration seen as a headwind for markets in a higher rate environment. Earnings and economic data were considered critical factors to watch by the traders.

enhances Dario's comprehensive GLP-1 offering with virtual physician management to meet growing demand from employers covering weight-loss medications, opening new revenue streams in direct-to-consumer and pharma channels NEW YORK , Jan. 14, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- January 14, 2025 --\u00a0DarioHealth Corp. (Nasdaq: DRIO) (\"Dario\" or the \"Company\"), a leader in the global digital health market, today announced a collaboration with MediOrbis, a multi-specialty digital health provider, to add prescribing capabilities to Dario's GLP-1 behavior change solution for a comprehensive medical weight loss program. This strategic addition creates a fully integrated solution for employers covering weight-loss medications and supports direct-to-consumer offerings, expanding Dario's addressable market in one of the fastest-growing segments of digital health. DarioHealth Logo Employer coverage of GLP-1 medications for weight loss continues to grow, with a recent survey from Mercer showing 44% of large employers now covering obesity drugs.[1] As more employers cover obesity medications, the rising costs of these drugs highlight the need for strategic plan designs that ensure judicious use of medications in close collaboration with behavior change programs to drive sustainable clinical outcomes while maximizing return-on-investment (ROI). Dario's aim is to ensure the drug is prescribed to the right people and to facilitate successful onboarding and offboarding processes. The Company leverages its unique expertise in behavior change to guide users through a healthy and effective GLP-1 journey, resulting in real, sustainable weight loss through lifelong healthy lifestyle modification. This new collaboration\u00a0enhances Dario's comprehensive GLP-1 solution by adding a key physician oversight including prescribing capability, positioning the Company to potentially drive recurring revenue and expand its addressable market in response to growing employer demand for holistic, cost-effective weight management programs. Dario works with employers to support a wide range of GLP-1 benefits strategies by delivering the GLP-1 behavior change solution as required under plan design to help employees successfully lose weight and improve measurable results before, during and after the use of a GLP-1 medication. The addition of MediOrbis prescribing capabilities extends Dario's ability to optimize outcomes and ROI for employers by layering seamless access to care across the behavior change journey for people who are most likely to benefit from the addition of a GLP-1 medication. Story Continues \"The GLP-1 market is rapidly expanding, but employers need more than access to medications\u2014they need a solution that drives long-term health improvements and cost savings,\" said Steven Nelson , Chief Commercial Officer at Dario. \"Our new collaboration\u00a0with MediOrbis completes our end-to-end GLP-1 solution, enabling us to meet this demand by combining virtual prescribing with proven behavior change programs. We believe that this strategic move positions Dario to capture more opportunities in the employer and direct-to-consumer markets while delivering actionable insights to our pharma partners, opening new pathways for recurring revenue.\" Dr. Omar Manejwala , Chief Medical Officer at Dario commented: \"Achieving sustainable weight loss with GLP-1 medications requires more than just a prescription\u2014it demands continuous, personalized support to maintain results. We believe that our collaboration with MediOrbis strengthens our ability to provide seamless, high-quality virtual care that complements our behavior change programs, ensuring members achieve meaningful health outcomes while employers see long-term value from their investment.\" Dr. Jonathan Wiesen , Co \u2013 Founder and Chief Medical Officer of MediOrbis commented: \"We are excited to collaborate with Dario to leverage digital care to address and manage obesity and other specialty and chronic illnesses, which are the most prevalent and resource-consumptive health conditions.\u00a0 This collaboration allows us to continue to seek to innovate and develop meaningful clinical programs that impact the health, productivity and well-being of employees worldwide.\" About DarioHealth Corp.

Solution, Unlocking New Revenue Streams in Rapidly Growing Multi Billion Dollar Market Business Wire Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 8:09 PM 2 min read In This Article: DRIO +1.61% NEW YORK, January 14, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Market News Alerts Updates that DarioHealth Corp. (Nasdaq: DRIO) is taking another bold step into the rapidly growing weight-loss market, now projected to exceed $100 billion annually by 2030. The company\u2019s latest move expands its GLP-1 offering with prescribing capabilities, positioning Dario to capture a larger share of this lucrative space as demand for medical weight-loss solutions skyrockets across employers and consumers. Following the announcement, Dario\u2019s shares surged nearly 14%, reflecting investor excitement over this significant growth opportunity. The market for GLP-1 medications, driven by blockbuster drugs like Novo Nordisk\u2019s Ozempic and Wegovy, is transforming how obesity and weight management are addressed. These medications have shown impressive results, leading to double-digit weight loss, but the rising costs are pushing employers to seek solutions that ensure better ROI. With 44% of large employers now covering obesity medications, according to a recent Mercer survey , Dario\u2019s expanded offering provides an end-to-end program to improve employee health outcomes while managing costs. Unlike many digital health providers, Dario\u2019s solution integrates behavior change programs with physician oversight, ensuring that GLP-1 medications are prescribed to the right people and supported by sustainable lifestyle changes. This approach aims to prevent the all-too-common cycle of weight regain after medication use, a key concern for both individuals and employers. The new prescribing capability is a critical piece of the puzzle, enabling Dario to oversee the entire weight-loss journey and optimize long-term results. Beyond employers, the direct-to-consumer market is another high-growth target for Dario. As more consumers seek out medical weight-loss options online, the company\u2019s digital platform, combined with virtual care, offers an easily accessible, scalable solution to meet this demand. Additionally, pharmaceutical companies are increasingly seeking partners like Dario to provide data-driven insights and improve patient engagement, opening potential new revenue streams. Dario\u2019s move follows the success of GLP-1 giants Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, whose treatments have reshaped the market. However, while the market leaders focus on medications alone, Dario\u2019s behavior-first model differentiates it by tackling the underlying habits that drive lasting weight loss. As the GLP-1 market continues to expand, Dario\u2019s integrated solution could position the company as a key digital health partner for employers, consumers, and pharma companies alike\u2014tapping into one of healthcare\u2019s most promising opportunities for growth.

(Nasdaq: DRIO) (\"Dario\" or the \"Company\"), a leader in the global digital health market, today announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, highlighting substantial improvements in financial performance and business momentum. DarioHealth Logo The Company delivered revenue growth and multiple key client wins, laying a solid foundation for 2025. These achievements not only demonstrate continued progress in financial metrics, but also reflect the successful execution of long-term strategic initiatives aimed at driving sustainable growth. \"Our third quarter included strong execution of our multi-year strategic plan of being a profitable provider of comprehensive chronic care management solutions which engage members and improve outcomes at a reduced cost of care,\" said Erez Raphael , CEO of Dario. \"Our efforts to streamline costs following the Twill merger, combined with revenue growth across multiple channels, have positioned us for ongoing success. We're seeing clear progress in our transformation, and we remain focused on achieving profitability run rate by the end of 2025.\" The Company reported improvement across all key financial metrics, both sequentially and year-over-year. Q3 revenue reached $7.42 million , an increase of 18.7% from Q2 2024 and a 111% increase compared to Q3 2023, driven primarily by growth in the Company's core Business-to-Business-to-Consumer (B2B2C) business. Story Continues Through continued optimization of revenue channels and a transition to recurring revenue models, gross margins for the B2B2C business rose to 83% , with full business gross margins reaching 52% and pro-forma gross margins reaching 70.3% (on a non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis). Following the recent acquisition of Twill, Dario implemented focused cost-management strategies, reducing GAAP operating expenses to $15.9 million , a 16% sequential reduction from Q2 2024 and non-GAAP operating expenses to $12.3 million , a 15.9% reduction from Q2 2024. \"We are not just growing; we believe that we are improving the quality and predictability of our revenues,\" said Steven Nelson , Chief Commercial Officer at Dario. \"Securing 10 new clients this quarter, combined with diversifying our revenue streams, ensures that we are on a path for sustained success in 2025 and beyond.\" The Company reported a 25.7% reduction in GAAP operating losses sequentially, lowering such losses to $12 million , and 33.3% reduction in non-GAAP operating losses, lowering such losses to $7.1 million . Looking ahead, Dario expects this positive trend in financial performance to continue, driven by ongoing revenue growth, increasing gross margins due to positive mix shift and operating leverage related to our reduced fixed expenses. The Company anticipates a 38 % reduction in total operating expenses between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, alongside a 49 % reduction in operating losses and a 59% reduction in non-GAAP operating losses respectively, paving the way to achieve cash flow breakeven run rate by the end of 2025 . Business Highlights In Q3, the Company enhanced its commercial momentum by securing 10 new clients , positioning itself for strong growth in 2025. Dario focused on not only increasing revenues but also making them more sustainable by diversifying across channels and clients. This effort included transforming the pharma channel\u2014previously the Company's only non-recurring revenue stream\u2014into a recurring revenue model. Health Plans : The Company partnered with National Medicare Health Plan Partners and Twill by Dario to promote healthy aging and launched large-scale cardiometabolic programs in the Medicaid space. Employers : Dario signed contracts with seven new employers , primarily for cardiometabolic solutions, and secured its first health system as an employer contract . Additionally, the Company announced a new AARP benefit granting access to millions of AARP members for health and well-being programs starting in January 2025 .

The Company expects these contracts will contribute to revenue in the near term and are structured under the Company's new \"platform services subscription fee\" model, offering an annual recurring revenue stream. Additionally, this quarter marked the completion of the integration of Twill's capabilities into Dario's full multi-condition platform. The combined behavioral health, well-being, navigation, and engagement technologies now create the most comprehensive solution in the digital health market under the Dario brand. \"We are excited about the growing opportunities for our artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, especially as data becomes an increasingly vital asset in our business model,\" Erez Raphael added. \"By integrating generative AI and microservices, we believe we are poised to revolutionize areas like drug discovery, consumer engagement, and personalization, with our proprietary data setting us up for both internal and external monetization.\" With its market-leading expertise, Dario is well-positioned to capitalize on these emerging trends and continue delivering value to its stakeholders.

Financing income was $11 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to financing expense of $3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The reason for this increase was the revaluation of the pre-funded warrants issued as part of the consideration for the acquisition of Twill, due to its classification as a liability according to GAAP rules. Net loss was $33.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to a net loss of $45.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease was driven by the increase in financing income. Net loss excluding stock-based compensation, acquisition related expenses and depreciation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , was $13.9 million compared to a loss of $26.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\" Conference Call Details: Thursday, November 7 , 8:30am ET Dial-in Number: 1-800-717-1738 (domestic) or 1-646-307-1865 (international) Call me\u2122: https://emportal.ink/3SOTLAn Participants can use the dial-in numbers above and be answered by an operator OR click the Call me\u2122 link for instant telephone access to the event.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This news release and the statements of representatives and partners of the Company related thereto contain or may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, words such as \"plan,\" \"project,\" \"potential,\" \"seek,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"expect,\" \"believe,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"could,\" \"estimate\" or \"continue\" are intended to identify forward-looking statements. For example, when the Company discusses its expected reduced operating expenses expected by Q1 2025 and the resulting operating losses by such time period, that it expects to reach breakeven by the end of 2025, its expected breakeven timeline is supported by its progress in its high margin B2B2C channel, that its reduction of costs following the acquisition of Twill, combined with revenue growth across multiple channels, positions the Company for ongoing success, that it believes it sees clear progress in its transformation and remains focused on achieving a profitably run rate by the end of 2025, that it expects the positive trends in financial performance to continue, driven by ongoing revenue growth, increasing gross margins due to positive mix shift and operating leverage related to its reduced fixed expenses, its expected reduction in total operating expenses between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, its expected reduction in operating losses and\u00a0 in non-GAAP operating losses respectively, paving the way to achieve cash flow breakeven run rate by the end of 2025, that it is positioned for strong growth in 2025, its plan to transform its pharmaceutical channel into a recurring revenue model, that its belief that two new contracts with a pharmaceutical company and a medical device company will contribute to the Company's revenue in the near term, its belief that the combined behavioral health, well-being, navigation, and engagement technologies now create the most comprehensive solution in the digital health market under the Dario brand, its belief that, by integrating generative AI and microservices, the Company is poised to revolutionize areas like drug discovery, consumer engagement, and personalization, with our proprietary data setting us up for both internal and external monetization and its belief that with its market-leading expertise, Dario is well-positioned to capitalize on these emerging trends and continue delivering value to its stakeholders.\u00a0Readers are cautioned that certain important factors may affect the Company's actual results and could cause such results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements that may be made in this news release. Factors that may affect the Company's results include, but are not limited to, regulatory approvals, product demand, market acceptance, impact of competitive products and prices, product development, commercialization or technological difficulties, the success or failure of negotiations and trade, legal, social and economic risks, and the risks associated with the adequacy of existing cash resources. Additional factors that could cause or contribute to differences between the Company's actual results and forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those risks discussed in the Company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Readers are cautioned that actual results (including, without limitation, the timing for and results of the Company's commercial and regulatory plans for Dario\u2122 as described herein) may differ significantly from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We have provided in this release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with peer companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures provided in the financial statement tables below. Operating expenses (non-GAAP) . Our presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses excludes stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquisition related expenses and depreciation of fixed assets. Due to varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions, and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company's non-cash operating expenses, we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude non-cash expenses provides us with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating our own core business operating results over different periods of time. Net loss (non-GAAP) . Our presentation of adjusted net loss excludes the effect of certain items that are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted net loss represents net loss determined under GAAP without regard to stock-based compensation expenses, deferred inventory, depreciation of fixed assets, earn-out remeasurement and acquisition related expenses and amortization. We believe these measures provide useful information to management and investors for analysis of our operating results. DARIOHEALTH CORP.

Positive Points DarioHealth Corp ( NASDAQ:DRIO ) reported a significant revenue increase of 111% year-over-year, reaching $7.42 million in Q3 2024. The company achieved a gross margin of 83% in its B2B2C business, reflecting strong operational efficiency. DarioHealth Corp ( NASDAQ:DRIO ) secured 10 new client contracts in Q3 2024, with expectations to add 5 more by year-end, indicating strong business momentum. The company successfully reduced non-GAAP operating expenses by 15.9% sequentially, demonstrating effective cost management. DarioHealth Corp ( NASDAQ:DRIO ) transitioned its Pharma business to a subscription-based model, enhancing revenue predictability and stability. Negative Points Despite revenue growth, DarioHealth Corp ( NASDAQ:DRIO ) is not yet cash flow positive, with a target to achieve this by the end of 2025. The company faces challenges in converting new client logos into meaningful revenues efficiently. DarioHealth Corp ( NASDAQ:DRIO ) is still in the process of integrating recent acquisitions, which may pose operational challenges. The transition from milestone-based to subscription-based revenue in the Pharma channel may initially create revenue volatility. The company is undergoing significant organizational changes, including budget reallocations, which could impact short-term operational stability. Q & A Highlights Q : As we approach 2025, can you provide some guidance on how we should think about the 2025 growth range for B2B2C revenue? A : Erez Raphael, CEO: We have around 25 new clients this year, which is more than a 30% increase in our client base. While we are not providing precise guidance, we expect to reach a $50 million run rate by the end of next year, which will make the company operationally cash flow positive. Story Continues Q : The B2B2C revenue stepped up sequentially this quarter. Should we continue thinking about the annual range of $8 to $9 million as the continued range going forward? A : Erez Raphael, CEO: On the B2C side, we are looking at an $8 million range, which should remain stable. For B2B2C, we are projecting a growth of 50% to 70% in revenues this year. Q : Can you share what you estimate each of the new Pharma customers can contribute, particularly the large Pharma customer? A : Steven Nelson, Chief Commercial Officer: We have a range for these accounts, from $500,000 to $5 million, depending on their goals and scale. We are working to convert milestone-based contracts to platform fees for more predictable revenue. Q : Do the prior Pharma partners remain on track under the legacy model? A : Steven Nelson, Chief Commercial Officer: We aim to convert existing contracts to more stable, predictable revenue models. The goal is to eliminate revenue lumpiness and achieve a healthier revenue mix. Q : What are the key levers for OpEx improvement, and how do you plan to grow on a more stable OpEx base? A : Erez Raphael, CEO: We have absorbed an entire organization with minimal increase in OpEx. We expect to reach a $41 million run rate by Q1 2025. We've strategically shifted budget from R&D to sales and marketing, focusing on revenue growth with existing assets.
