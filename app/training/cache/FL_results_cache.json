[{"text": "Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) Will Be Hoping To Turn Its Returns On Capital Around editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 2:29 PM 3 min read In This Article: FL -5.84% To avoid investing in a business that's in decline, there's a few financial metrics that can provide early indications of aging. A business that's potentially in decline often shows two trends, a return on capital employed (ROCE) that's declining, and a base of capital employed that's also declining. Ultimately this means that the company is earning less per dollar invested and on top of that, it's shrinking its base of capital employed. In light of that, from a first glance at Foot Locker ( NYSE:FL ), we've spotted some signs that it could be struggling, so let's investigate. Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Foot Locker, this is the formula: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.024 = US$130m \u00f7 (US$6.9b - US$1.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to November 2024) . Thus, Foot Locker has an ROCE of 2.4%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Specialty Retail industry average of 13%.

If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Foot Locker . The Trend Of ROCE We are a bit worried about the trend of returns on capital at Foot Locker. About five years ago, returns on capital were 14%, however they're now substantially lower than that as we saw above. And on the capital employed front, the business is utilizing roughly the same amount of capital as it was back then. Since returns are falling and the business has the same amount of assets employed, this can suggest it's a mature business that hasn't had much growth in the last five years. If these trends continue, we wouldn't expect Foot Locker to turn into a multi-bagger. The Key Takeaway All in all, the lower returns from the same amount of capital employed aren't exactly signs of a compounding machine. Long term shareholders who've owned the stock over the last five years have experienced a 39% depreciation in their investment, so it appears the market might not like these trends either. With underlying trends that aren't great in these areas, we'd consider looking elsewhere.

Shoe Carnival (NASDAQ:SCVL) Max Juang Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 12:01 PM 5 min read In This Article: SCVL -5.91% BOOT -9.53% DBI -6.16% FL -5.84% Reflecting On Footwear Retailer Stocks\u2019 Q3 Earnings: Shoe Carnival (NASDAQ:SCVL) As the Q3 earnings season wraps, let\u2019s dig into this quarter\u2019s best and worst performers in the footwear retailer industry, including Shoe Carnival (NASDAQ:SCVL) and its peers. Footwear sales\u2013like their apparel counterparts\u2013are driven by seasons, trends, and innovation more so than absolute need and similarly face the bigger-picture secular trend of e-commerce penetration. Footwear plays a part in societal belonging, personal expression, and occasion, and retailers selling shoes recognize this. Therefore, they aim to balance selection, competitive prices, and the latest trends to attract consumers. Unlike their apparel counterparts, footwear retailers most sell popular third-party brands (as opposed to their own exclusive brands), which could mean less exclusivity of product but more nimbleness to pivot to what\u2019s hot. The 4 footwear retailer stocks we track reported a slower Q3. As a group, revenues missed analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 2% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was in line. Amidst this news, share prices of the companies have had a rough stretch. On average, they are down 5.4% since the latest earnings results. Shoe Carnival (NASDAQ:SCVL) Known for its playful atmosphere that features carnival elements, Shoe Carnival (NASDAQ:SCVL) is a retailer that sells footwear from mainstream brands for the entire family. Shoe Carnival reported revenues of $306.9 million, down 4.1% year on year. This print fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations by 3%. Overall, it was a slower quarter for the company with a slight miss of analysts\u2019 gross margin and EBITDA estimates. \u201cOur Back-to-School results were strong, with comparable store sales growth across our banners and robust margins. Our flexible digital-first marketing campaign and great brand assortment drove demand during this peak shopping period and profitability in line with expectations for the third quarter. I am very proud of our team for delivering the Company\u2019s profit results despite two significant hurricanes disrupting third quarter sales and a very warm October that delayed the start of our winter boot season,\u201d said Mark Worden, President and Chief Executive Officer.

Market Update In response to the Fed's rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has been gradually trending down from its post-pandemic peak, trending closer to the Fed's 2% target. Despite higher borrowing costs, the economy has avoided flashing recessionary signals. This is the much-desired soft landing that many investors hoped for. The recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% in November 2024) have bolstered the stock market, making 2024 a strong year for equities. Donald Trump\u2019s presidential win in November sparked additional market gains, sending indices to record highs in the days following his victory. However, debates continue over possible tariffs and corporate tax adjustments, raising questions about economic stability in 2025. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals?

What you may have missed Foot Locker names Sonia Syngal to board of directors Foot Locker on Tuesday announced two additions to its board of directors , including former Gap Inc. CEO Sonia Syngal . Syngal, who is also on Tanger\u2019s board, has two decades of experience in retail, including in e-commerce, supply chain, brand strategy, operations and marketing, per a company press release.

New Balance sales hit a record New Balance this week said its global sales hit a record $7.8 billion in 2024, a year that\u2019s been tough for sneaker brands like Nike and Under Armour, as well as some resale sites. This was a 20% increase from the previous year and a whopping 136% from five years ago. The company credits its partnerships with Olympic gold medalist and world record holder Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone and Los Angeles Dodgers designated hitter Shohei Ohtani, plus its collabs with brands like Kith and Aim\u00e9 Leon Dore. \u201cThrough selective partnerships and distribution, they\u2019ve elevated the brand to premium status while breathing new life into retro styles that resonate with younger consumers like never before,\u201d the 119-year-old brand said in an emailed press release. Story Continues Retail therapy That don\u2019t impress me much Earlier this week, Walmart unveiled what it called \u201ca comprehensive brand refresh\u201d \u2014 the first of its kind since 2008 . The refresh includes more vibrant yellows and blues, greater emphasis on its spark logo and a new wordmark that was inspired by founder Sam Walton\u2019s classic trucker hat. While Walmart dubs this the first refresh in nearly 20 years, onlookers weren\u2019t impressed. Commenting on the changes, one X user commented \u201csimply increase saturation a bit and you have a bold new direction,\u201d while another sarcastically called the refresh \u201cso bold and visionary.\u201d Even discount grocer Aldi poked fun at the retail giant\u2019s big reveal, posting side-by-side images of its logo on Instagram with the caption \u201cSpot the difference! #IYKYK\u201d Walmart seems to have stayed in good spirits despite the backlash, even poking fun at itself. On its X account on Wednesday, the retailer posted increasingly thicker versions of its spark logo with the text, \u201cThe future is bright\u2026and slightly more thick.\u201d Pasta lovers unite Ahead of Valentine\u2019s Day, Barilla Canada released heart-shaped pasta on Wednesday. The limited-edition Barilla Love Pasta will be available at Walmart, IGA, Metro Quebec and other grocery stores based in Canada while supplies last. The pasta debuted in the U.S. in previous years and per Barilla, \u201cCanadians pleaded with the brand to make the special pasta available,\u201d in the country. What we\u2019re still thinking about 61 That\u2019s how many years Ronald S. Lauder spent with Est\u00e9e Lauder before his recent retirement from the board of directors . On Jan. 10, Est\u00e9e Lauder said the longtime executive and board member, who joined the company in 1964, would retire from the company\u2019s board of directors. In his time at the company, Ronald Lauder served on the board from 1968 to 1986, from 1988 to July 2009 and from 2016 till now. He designated two directors of the company per a shareholder agreement with the Lauder family: his daughter Jane Lauder and son-in-law Eric Zinterhofer. Ronald Lauder plans to remain chairman of Clinique Laboratories. 3,283 That\u2019s how many retail-related job cuts there were in December , up 2,800% from the year-ago period when there were 110 cuts, according to a recent report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. From the previous month, December\u2019s job cuts grew nearly 45%. While cuts in December grew, for the full year retail downsizing narrowed by 47%. Retailers continued to make hires during the year as well, with the number of hirings reaching 536,600 in 2024, compared to 440,893 in 2023. What we\u2019re watching Will the California fire recovery drive home improvement growth? As residents and businesses attempt to recover from the devastation of the Los Angeles-area wildfires, growth is likely to surge for some retail sectors in the coming years. In a Wednesday note, Wells Fargo analysts said home improvement retail \u2014 companies like The Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s and Tractor Supply \u2014 are likely well-positioned for growth due to rebuilding-related demand as the emergency situation is brought under control. As of Friday, about 25 people had died, over 40,000 acres had burned and more than 12,300 structures were destroyed , according to state officials. In the two largest incidents, the Palisades fire was about 31% contained, while the Eaton fire was 65% contained as of Friday, per The Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. AccuWeather figures cited by Wells Fargo estimated the total damage and economic loss ranged between $250 billion and $275 billion. Assuming 75% of the structures were housing units and rebuilding materials will cost between $1 million to $2 million per unit, that could represent a $10 billion to $20 billion home improvement sector tailwind during the next one to two years, Wells Fargo said. Wayfair, RH and others in the home furnishings segment are also likely to see a benefit as area residents refurnish their homes.

Footwear Retailer Stocks As the craze of earnings season draws to a close, here\u2019s a look back at some of the most exciting (and some less so) results from Q3. Today, we are looking at footwear retailer stocks, starting with Designer Brands (NYSE:DBI). Footwear sales\u2013like their apparel counterparts\u2013are driven by seasons, trends, and innovation more so than absolute need and similarly face the bigger-picture secular trend of e-commerce penetration. Footwear plays a part in societal belonging, personal expression, and occasion, and retailers selling shoes recognize this. Therefore, they aim to balance selection, competitive prices, and the latest trends to attract consumers. Unlike their apparel counterparts, footwear retailers most sell popular third-party brands (as opposed to their own exclusive brands), which could mean less exclusivity of product but more nimbleness to pivot to what\u2019s hot. The 4 footwear retailer stocks we track reported a slower Q3. As a group, revenues missed analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 2% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was in line.

Market Update The Fed\u2019s interest rate hikes throughout 2022 and 2023 have successfully cooled post-pandemic inflation, bringing it closer to the 2% target. Inflationary pressures have eased without tipping the economy into a recession, suggesting a soft landing. This stability, paired with recent rate cuts (0.5% in September 2024 and 0.25% in November 2024), fueled a strong year for the stock market in 2024. The markets surged further after Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory in November, with major indices reaching record highs in the days following the election.

Barn (NYSE:BOOT) Impresses Petr Hu\u0159\u0165\u00e1k Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 12:03 PM 5 min read In This Article: BOOT -9.53% SCVL -5.91% DBI -6.16% FL -5.84% Q3 Footwear Retailer Earnings: Boot Barn (NYSE:BOOT) Impresses As the Q3 earnings season wraps, let\u2019s dig into this quarter\u2019s best and worst performers in the footwear retailer industry, including Boot Barn (NYSE:BOOT) and its peers. Footwear sales\u2013like their apparel counterparts\u2013are driven by seasons, trends, and innovation more so than absolute need and similarly face the bigger-picture secular trend of e-commerce penetration. Footwear plays a part in societal belonging, personal expression, and occasion, and retailers selling shoes recognize this. Therefore, they aim to balance selection, competitive prices, and the latest trends to attract consumers. Unlike their apparel counterparts, footwear retailers most sell popular third-party brands (as opposed to their own exclusive brands), which could mean less exclusivity of product but more nimbleness to pivot to what\u2019s hot. The 4 footwear retailer stocks we track reported a slower Q3. As a group, revenues missed analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 2% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was in line. While some footwear retailer stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they have collectively declined. On average, share prices are down 4.8% since the latest earnings results. Best Q3: Boot Barn (NYSE:BOOT) With a strong store presence in Texas, California, Florida, and Oklahoma, Boot Barn (NYSE:BOOT) is a western-inspired apparel and footwear retailer. Boot Barn reported revenues of $425.8 million, up 13.7% year on year. This print was in line with analysts\u2019 expectations, but overall, it was a mixed quarter for the company with a solid beat of analysts\u2019 EBITDA estimates but EPS guidance for next quarter missing analysts\u2019 expectations. Mr. Starrett stated, \u201cJohn Hazen is very highly regarded within the Boot Barn organization and has a diverse background that includes brand building, digital, and store roles. He has a strong track record of growing sales and profits both at Boot Barn and prior to joining the Company. He also has been extremely instrumental in advancing Boot Barn\u2019s customer-facing technology capabilities including many industry-leading applications of artificial intelligence. I am confident in his ability to step into the role as Interim CEO. Personally, I am looking forward to providing oversight and mentorship as Executive Chairman while the Board conducts an internal and external search before making a permanent decision on our next CEO.\u201d Boot Barn Total Revenue Boot Barn achieved the biggest analyst estimates beat, fastest revenue growth, and highest full-year guidance raise of the whole group. The results were likely priced in, however, and the stock is flat since reporting. It currently trades at $162. Story Continues Is now the time to buy Boot Barn?

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our 9 Best Market-Beating Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Zacks Equity Research Fri, Jan 3, 2025, 7:30 PM 6 min read In This Article: FL -5.84% URBN -3.14% A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Foot Locker (FL). Shares have added about 2.4% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500. Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Foot Locker due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts. Foot Locker Q3 Earnings Miss Expectations, 2024 View Down Foot Locker posted third-quarter fiscal 2024 results, with both bottom and top lines lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company\u2019s revenues decreased and earnings increased from the year-ago quarter. The company saw positive comparable sales trends and gross margin expansion, but third-quarter performance fell short due to softened consumer spending after the Back-to-School period and a more promotional environment. Progress continued with the Lace Up Plan and partnerships, including the 'Home Court' experience with Nike and Jordan Brand and a deal with the Chicago Bulls. While early November trends were weak, there was a strong acceleration during Thanksgiving week. The company lowered its full-year outlook due to softer demand and a more promotional environment but remains focused on growth through new store formats, a revamped digital experience and enhanced customer engagement, aiming for an 8.5-9% EBIT margin by 2028. More on Foot Locker\u2019s Q3 Financial Results The athletic shoes and apparel retailer posted adjusted earnings of 33 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of adjusted earnings of 39 cents. However, the figure increased from adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 30 cents in the prior-year quarter. Total revenues of $1,961 million decreased 1.4% from the year-ago period. Excluding the impacts of foreign-currency fluctuations, total sales decreased 2.2%. Revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,001 million. Comparable sales increased 2.4% year over year, driven by a 2.8% increase in global Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker sales. Notably, the Champs Sports and WSS banners also reported positive comparable sales growth of 2.8% and 1.8%, respectively. Insight Into FL\u2019s Margins FL's gross margin rate increased 230 basis points (bps). This was primarily due to lower markdown levels. The selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 210 bps from the prior-year period. This increase was due to investments in technology and brand-building investments. However, it was partially offset by savings from the cost-optimization program and ongoing expense discipline.

(FL): Is This Sporting Goods Stock A Good Buy Now? Minal Zaheer Mon, Dec 30, 2024, 7:26 PM 7 min read In This Article: FL -5.84% NKE -0.40% We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Sporting Goods Stocks To Invest In Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL) stands against the other sporting goods stocks. The sports industry typically generates millions of dollars through events, promotions, and endorsements. It is one of the few sectors that continued to prosper, even during the pandemic. The global sporting and athletic goods market is projected to grow significantly, driven by consumer health awareness and rising demand for fitness products. The market value reached $52.02 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.2% through 2032, due to innovation in sporting technology and materials. Sports stocks have climbed more than 10% year-to-date, pushing the sports index of the broader market to its highest level since July of last year. The market has experienced a sudden increase in demand as it recovers from the pandemic. The pandemic initially disrupted the market with postponed events like the Olympics and supply chain challenges. However, increased consumer awareness around fitness and health post-pandemic has further fueled the global demand for sports and sporting goods. This growth in demand has varied across regions. Western Europe and Asia Pacific have been at the forefront of the sales recovery, while Latin America has maintained its impressive growth momentum. North America also achieved steady progress, building on its previous year's performance. Looking ahead, Latin America and Southeast Asia show the greatest potential, with growth rates of 22% and 11%, respectively, in 2023. Meanwhile, although China rebounded after a challenging 2022, analysts remain cautious about future growth due to ongoing economic difficulties. Global economic challenges, such as high inflation and uncertainty, are shaping consumer behavior. Rising prices are a top concern for consumers worldwide, affecting purchasing power and brand loyalty. Despite these challenges, sports participation is increasing in some regions, particularly in activities that are accessible, social, and less time-consuming. For instance, customer preference for pickleball and paddle tennis has increased by 159% since the pandemic. As consumer preferences evolve, companies are adapting their strategies to cater to different demographics, particularly the expanding older population. Rising Demand for Sustainable Sporting Goods One of the key trends in this industry is the increasing preference for sustainable sporting goods. Despite economic pressures, many consumers are willing to pay 9.7% more on average for products that have a positive environmental impact. Legislation is also playing a big role in driving sustainability. Laws like the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and the EU Green Deal are pushing investments in green energy and sustainable solutions, including in sporting goods. The EU\u2019s Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation and Waste Framework Directive are setting stricter standards for product design, recyclability, and end-of-life management. Moreover, regulations like the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive are increasing the pressure on companies to be transparent about their environmental and social impacts. Story Continues To address these challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities, more than 80% of sporting goods companies, both large and small, are adopting ambitious sustainability goals like CO2 reduction targets. By adopting sustainable practices, companies can not only benefit the planet but also boost brand reputation and attract eco-conscious consumers.

(FL) Stock Trades Down, Here Is Why Anthony Lee Mon, Dec 30, 2024, 7:00 PM 2 min read In This Article: FL -5.84% Foot Locker (FL) Stock Trades Down, Here Is Why What Happened? Shares of footwear and apparel retailer Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) fell 7.3% in the pre-market session after the major indices tumbled (Nasdaq down 1.9%, S&P 500 down 1.7%), marking a volatile ending to an otherwise good year for stocks. This marks the second straight day of broad-based declines with similar downturns (Nasdaq down 1.5%, S&P 500 down 1.1%) recorded on the previous trading day, Friday, December 27, 2024. This suggests that perhaps investors are locking in gains and positioning portfolios for 2025. The shares closed the day at $22, down 3.8% from previous close. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Foot Locker? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free . What The Market Is Telling Us Foot Locker\u2019s shares are extremely volatile and have had 30 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 26 days ago when the stock dropped 17.3% on the news that the company reported disappointing third-quarter results: Revenue and EPS in the quarter fell below Wall Street's expectations. The company observed softer consumer spending trends following the peak Back-to-School period in August. Compounding the issue, a more aggressive promotional environment likely weakened its pricing power, adding pressure to margins. Its full-year EPS guidance also missed significantly. Overall, this was a weaker quarter. Foot Locker is down 28.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $22 per share, it is trading 37.4% below its 52-week high of $35.15 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Foot Locker\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $563.67. Today\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next .

Foot Locker (FL) Is the Undervalued Stock You Need to Know Ramish Cheema Sat, Dec 28, 2024, 3:10 AM 8 min read In This Article: FL -5.84% ^RUT -1.28% We recently published a list of the Jim Cramer's Hidden Gems: 10 Undervalued Stocks You Need to Know . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL) stands against other undervalued stocks you need to know according to Jim Cramer. With the year coming to a close, Jim Cramer, like everyone else, has a couple of things on his mind. The tail end of December saw significant turmoil in markets as while the Federal Reserve did cut interest rates by 25 basis points, it took a hawkish approach for its 2-25 rate cut cycle. The central bank guided just two cuts in 2025 as opposed to the earlier four, which led to the flagship S&P index dropping by 2.95% on the day of its decision. Yet, the close of the week would prove to be a boon for markets in the form of the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index. The PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation reading, and for November, it sat at 2.4% on an annualized basis. This was lower than the 2.5% that economists had predicted, and as a result, markets took a breather with the S&P closing 1.1% higher on Friday. However, while the flagship S&P index might have pared back some of its losses, the Russell index that tracks 2,000 small-cap stocks didn't perform so well. On the day the Fed announced its rate cut, this stock index sank by 4.39%. Yet, while the S&P surpassed a percentage point in gains on Friday, the Russel index lagged it to close 0.94% higher. The small-cap stock index also missed this week's Santa Claus rally. From Monday to the close of trading on Christmas Eve, the S&P had gained 1.84% to nearly reverse all of its losses since the Fed's meeting. However, the Russell index ended up 0.78% higher and is still down 3.18% from its Tuesday close before the Fed's conference. The fact that small-cap stocks fell sharply after the Fed's 'bullish bearishness' and failed to regain momentum after the PCE data is unsurprising. These companies, due to their lighter balance sheets and localized presence, are more sensitive to economic slowdowns than large and mega-cap stocks. Their dependence on economic performance was clear after President-elect Donald Trump's win in the November election following which the Russell index soared by 4%. The last time the index had posted similar and stronger gains was in July when it had gained by 11.54% in the second week. As you'd expect, the bullishness was driven by none other than the economy. Small-cap stocks soared when the consumer price index dipped by 0.1% in June for its first such drop in more than four years. Gains made by small-cap stocks came right when investors had, for the time being, had enough with technology stocks. This was indicated by the broader NASDAQ index gaining just 0.43% while the Russell index had soared by 11.54%. Story Continues This searing performance by small-cap stocks didn't go unnoticed by Cramer. In an episode of CNBC's Mad Money, the host commented on recent small-cap stock performance trends. Cramer used the rally to highlight the importance of sticking to the stock market instead of just relying on day trading. He outlined that \"When you get these kind of rallies, and you get them very rarely, it reminds you that you have to stay in this market to make big money. You can't flit in, fled out!\" Cramer added, \"When I say stay in, I mean that you have to be as invested as you possibly can be so you don't miss monster moves like the Russell 2000 up 3.5% today.\" Commenting on the reasons behind the small-cap stock rally, Cramer posited that \"it started when we got that cool consumer price index reading we got last Thursday. No inflation in the month of June, that's what triggered it!\" According to him, the inflation reading was \"the first prop of the small-cap rally.\" Cramer shared that \"Most people are surprised to see that the lowering of inflation could trigger a gigantic rally among so many small-cap stocks.\" He dug deeper into the stocks that had gained and pointed out that risky loss-making firms reliant on low inflation and small and medium businesses that benefit from low interest rates were doing particularly well. According to him \"almost all [STOCKS MAKING GAINS] are biotechs\" that are \"losing money.\" Cramer outlined that \"If you look at the top 35 performers all of which are up more than 35% since a week, less than a week, including 11 that are up more than 50%, you'll see that roughly half are biotechs and healthcare companies almost all losing money.\" Since Cramer's remarks, the Russell index has essentially remained flat and gained a mere 0.90%. This time period has seen it soar after Trump's election win and then sink after the Federal Reserve's rate cut update. Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: Top 10 Stocks Our Methodology To make our list of Jim Cramer's hidden gems, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks with a market value lower than $6 billion, analyzed their performance, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. ( see more details here ). Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE: FL ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 27 Date of Cramer\u2019s Comments: 8-28-24 Performance Since Then: -22.24% Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL) is a footwear retailer that is one of the best-known firms of its kind. The market hasn't been kind to its shares in 2024 as they are down by 26% year-to-date. Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL)'s stock devastation started in March after the shares tanked by 29% in one trading day. The drop occurred after the firm's midpoint guidance of $1.60 per share missed analyst estimates of $1.93 and it revealed that its long term profit margin target would be delayed by two years. Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL)'s woes are related to softer demand for Nike's shoes, and the stock sank by another 20% in December after the firm projected annual sales to drop at a low end of 1% from an earlier 1% growth. Cramer pointed out in September that the only reason to buy Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL) would be for the long term: \"Second down retailer hits too close to home. I'm talking about Foot Locker. As a former holding of the Charitable Trust, we bailed on in June. Absolute numbers here were not as strong as ANF's. Foot Locker still firmly in turnaround mode under new CEO Mary Dillon. I should say relatively new, but they were still better than expected across the board. Overall, FL ranks 3rd on our list of undervalued stocks you need to know according to Jim Cramer.

(FL): Buy, Sell, or Hold Post Q3 Earnings? Radek Strnad Mon, Dec 23, 2024, 12:09 PM 3 min read In This Article: FL -5.84% Foot Locker (FL): Buy, Sell, or Hold Post Q3 Earnings? Over the last six months, Foot Locker\u2019s shares have sunk to $22.41, producing a disappointing 15.9% loss - a stark contrast to the S&P 500\u2019s 9.3% gain. This was partly driven by its softer quarterly results and might have investors contemplating their next move. Is there a buying opportunity in Foot Locker, or does it present a risk to your portfolio? See what our analysts have to say in our full research report, it\u2019s free . Even with the cheaper entry price, we don't have much confidence in Foot Locker. Here are three reasons why FL doesn't excite us and a stock we'd rather own. Why Do We Think Foot Locker Will Underperform? Known for store associates whose uniforms resemble those of referees, Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) is a specialty retailer that sells athletic footwear, clothing, and accessories. 1. Shrinking Same-Store Sales Indicate Waning Demand Same-store sales is a key performance indicator used to measure organic growth at brick-and-mortar shops for at least a year. Foot Locker\u2019s demand has been shrinking over the last two years as its same-store sales have averaged 2.5% annual declines. Foot Locker Same-Store Sales Growth 2. EPS Trending Down Analyzing the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) shows whether a company's incremental sales were profitable \u2013 for example, revenue could be inflated through excessive spending on advertising and promotions. Sadly for Foot Locker, its EPS declined by 28.9% annually over the last five years while its revenue was flat. This tells us the company struggled because its fixed cost base made it difficult to adjust to choppy demand. Foot Locker Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) 3. High Debt Levels Increase Risk As long-term investors, the risk we care about most is the permanent loss of capital, which can happen when a company goes bankrupt or raises money from a disadvantaged position. This is separate from short-term stock price volatility, something we are much less bothered by. Foot Locker\u2019s $2.84 billion of debt exceeds the $211 million of cash on its balance sheet. Furthermore, its 8\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio (based on its EBITDA of $340 million over the last 12 months) shows the company is overleveraged. Foot Locker Net Cash Position At this level of debt, incremental borrowing becomes increasingly expensive and credit agencies could downgrade the company\u2019s rating if profitability falls. Foot Locker could also be backed into a corner if the market turns unexpectedly \u2013 a situation we seek to avoid as investors in high-quality companies. We hope Foot Locker can improve its balance sheet and remain cautious until it increases its profitability or pays down its debt. Story Continues Final Judgment Foot Locker doesn\u2019t pass our quality test. Following the recent decline, the stock trades at 10.9\u00d7 forward price-to-earnings (or $22.41 per share). This valuation tells us it\u2019s a bit of a market darling with a lot of good news priced in - you can find better investment opportunities elsewhere. We\u2019d suggest looking at FTAI Aviation, an aerospace company benefiting from Boeing and Airbus\u2019s struggles . Stocks We Would Buy Instead of Foot Locker With rates dropping, inflation stabilizing, and the elections in the rearview mirror, all signs point to the start of a new bull run - and we\u2019re laser-focused on finding the best stocks for this upcoming cycle.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Retail Dive newsletter . It\u2019s been another week with far more retail news than there is time in the day. Below, we break down some things you may have missed during the week, and what we\u2019re still thinking about. From Staples knocking down prices for small businesses to Guitar Center partnering with Shark Tank contestants, here\u2019s our closeout for the week. What you may have missed Could Nike\u2019s struggles boost Foot Locker? Nike on Thursday reported Q2 earnings, with revenue falling 8% to $12.4 billion . Although the sportswear giant is struggling under the weight of a DTC strategy that went too far , Needham analyst Tom Nikic said in a client note earlier this week that the brand\u2019s challenges could mean good things for Foot Locker in the long term. \u201cWe don't believe that NKE has turned the corner from a brand-heat perspective yet, but what we think is more important to FL is what NKE is doing strategically,\u201d Nikic wrote. \u201cRecognizing the mistake of over-emphasizing DTC and under-emphasizing Wholesale, NKE is now working more closely with FL, and we believe that NKE will speak positively about their strengthened relationship with their biggest wholesale partner, Foot Locker.\u201d Indeed, on a call with analysts Thursday, new CEO Elliott Hill called out Foot Locker specifically as one of the partners he had spoken directly with since taking over in October, and highlighted a broader strategy of rebuilding relationships with key wholesale partners. Nikic also said that Nike\u2019s efforts to clean up its distribution channels will benefit Foot Locker in the long term \u201cto a greater extent than any other retailer.\u201d Foot Locker itself has been going through a host of challenges under its turnaround strategy, including from Nike\u2019s pullback a few years ago, but sales fell just 1.4% in its latest quarter . Toys R Us to debut in Latin America and the Caribbean WHP Global, parent company of Toys R Us and Babies R Us, on Monday announced a partnership with Cotton Candy International to bring those brands to Latin America and the Caribbean for the first time. The first Toys R Us and Babies R Us flagship stores will open in Panama next year, with more stand-alone stores to soon follow across the region, according to a press release. \"Toys R Us continues to captivate consumers around the world, and we are thrilled to partner with a strong wholesale and retail operator like Cotton Candy International to introduce this beloved brand to families in Latin America for the very first time,\" Stanley Silverstein, chief commercial officer at WHP Global, said in a statement. Story Continues Perfect Moment faces NYSE delisting Luxury skiwear brand Perfect Moment on Tuesday received a warning from the New York Stock Exchange notifying it that it was no longer in compliance with its minimum stockholders\u2019 equity requirements . The stock market requires stockholders\u2019 equity of at least $4 million if the company has reported operating losses or net losses in three of the past four fiscal years. Perfect Moment had a stockholders\u2019 equity of $2.7 million as of Sept. 30. The brand has until Jan. 10 to submit its plan to regain compliance and until June 11, 2026, to meet the market\u2019s listing standards Retail therapy Beanie Babies get some bounce Toy company Ty Warner launched a new spin on its iconic Beanie Babies ahead of the holidays. The four-inch Beanie Bouncers are plush toys that also act like a bouncing ball. Available in specialty stores nationwide, the new toy retails for $5.99. The Beanie Bouncers come in 12 initial characters including Gilbert the giraffe, Purry the cat, Fins the shark, Buzzy the bee and Swish the axolotl, among others. Beanie Bouncers toys will be featured in a snow globe display at the exterior of the Sphere in Las Vegas through Sunday. Guitar Center strikes new chord with pick company partnership The visibility afforded by an appearance on the TV show \u201cShark Tank\u201d helped propel a new product into Guitar Center. Nicholas George and Kevin Mack co-founded guitar pick company Tik Pik. Their design keeps picks, an essential and often ubiquitous accessory, attached to a guitar and within easy reach of the musician when playing the instrument. In partnership with Guitar Center, the product is now available in over 300 physical Guitar Center stores and online. Guitar Center said in a press release that the Tik Pik features technology that allows them to adhere to your guitar without adhesive. They\u2019re available in a variety of weights to suit various playing styles. Tik Pik and Guitar Center also worked together to develop and offer an exclusive SKU that features a six pack of Tik Piks. What we\u2019re still thinking about 600+ That\u2019s how many items Staples will cut prices on in January , aimed at helping small businesses. The retailer\u2019s Home and Office Sale will have deals across tech, office supplies, furniture and other categories, according to a Tuesday announcement. \u201cStaples is dedicated to helping small businesses grow by providing value and savings on the products and services that matter most,\u201d Marshall Warkentin, president of Staples U.S. Retail, said in a statement. \u201cWith price reductions across a wide range of essentials, our Home and Office Sale is designed to help businesses start 2025 on the right foot and ensure they have what they need to succeed.\u201d Deals include up to $320 off select computers, up to $150 off select printers and $15 off print orders of $75 or more. $1.3B That\u2019s how much Walmart is investing in Walmart Chile over the next five years, according to a Monday announcement. The investment includes opening 70 new stores, expanding into new regions of Chile and opening a ninth distribution center in the Southern part of the country. \u201cThis is not just an investment in infrastructure and technology; it is an investment in people, in communities,\u201d Walmart Chile President and CEO Cristi\u00e1n Barrientos said in a statement. \u201cWe are building a better future for everyone, for future generations and for our children. We trust in Chile. We trust in its people. We continue exploring together.\u201d What we\u2019re watching New NRF crime stat tracks with less established FBI database, a \u2018coincidence\u2019 This week the National Retail Federation released a survey of loss prevention officers at 164 retailers, focused solely on crime, in lieu of the annual National Retail Security Survey it had conducted for over 30 years. The new study \u2014 the first on crime since the group retracted a statistic from a special report last year \u2014 contains some eye-watering numbers. That includes \u201ca 93% increase in the average number of shoplifting incidents per year in 2023 versus 2019 and a 90% increase in dollar loss due to shoplifting during that same time period.\u201d Those surveyed also noted a 26% increase in shoplifting from 2022 to 2023. One statistic from the FBI tracks with the NRF\u2019s finding on shoplifting, but there\u2019s a major caveat. An older crime database, the National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS, also shows shoplifting rates up 93% from 2019 to 2023. However, the law enforcement agency has another more established database (the Summary Reporting System) that shows those two years about even. NIBRS\u2019s spike is not entirely due to actual crime rates, but, rather, also reflects the ongoing addition of new sources of crime statistics. This makes the Summary more accurate for now, CCJ Senior Research Specialist Ernesto Lopez said last month. When asked about the parallel between the NIBRS and NRF numbers, NRF spokesperson Mary McGinty said by email that the new report was \u201cbased on data provided by retailers\u201d and that the similarity of the numbers \u201cis a coincidence.\u201d Recommended Reading The Weekly Closeout: Petco swings to a loss and Ace Hardware plans 170 stores this year View Comments Terms and Privacy

(NYSE:FL) Vs The Rest Of The Pack Jabin Bastian Thu, Dec 19, 2024, 12:01 PM 5 min read In This Article: FL -5.84% BOOT -9.53% DBI -6.16% SCVL -5.91% A Look Back at Footwear Retailer Stocks\u2019 Q3 Earnings: Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) Vs The Rest Of The Pack Wrapping up Q3 earnings, we look at the numbers and key takeaways for the footwear retailer stocks, including Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) and its peers. Footwear sales\u2013like their apparel counterparts\u2013are driven by seasons, trends, and innovation more so than absolute need and similarly face the bigger-picture secular trend of e-commerce penetration. Footwear plays a part in societal belonging, personal expression, and occasion, and retailers selling shoes recognize this. Therefore, they aim to balance selection, competitive prices, and the latest trends to attract consumers. Unlike their apparel counterparts, footwear retailers most sell popular third-party brands (as opposed to their own exclusive brands), which could mean less exclusivity of product but more nimbleness to pivot to what\u2019s hot. The 4 footwear retailer stocks we track reported a slower Q3. As a group, revenues missed analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 2% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was in line. While some footwear retailer stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they have collectively declined. On average, share prices are down 1.9% since the latest earnings results. Weakest Q3: Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) Known for store associates whose uniforms resemble those of referees, Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) is a specialty retailer that sells athletic footwear, clothing, and accessories. Foot Locker reported revenues of $1.96 billion, down 1.4% year on year. This print fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations by 2.1%. Overall, it was a disappointing quarter for the company with full-year EPS guidance missing analysts\u2019 expectations. Mary Dillon, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"Our team's continued focus on execution drove positive comparable sales trends and meaningful gross margin expansion in the quarter. However, our third quarter top- and bottom-line performance fell short of our expectations. Consumer spending trends softened following the peak Back-to-School period in August, and the promotional environment was more elevated than anticipated. At the same time, we continued to demonstrate progress with our Lace Up Plan, including further cementing our leadership position at the heart of basketball and sneaker culture. In the quarter, we continued the rollout of our Foot Locker 'Home Court' experience in collaboration with Nike and Jordan Brand, and we also announced a multi-year partnership with the legendary Chicago Bulls franchise.\" Foot Locker Total Revenue Unsurprisingly, the stock is down 8.6% since reporting and currently trades at $22.10.

The general rise in the price of goods and services is trending towards the Fed's 2% goal as of late, which is good news. The higher rates that fought inflation also didn't slow economic activity enough to catalyze a recession. So far, soft landing. This, combined with recent rate cuts (half a percent in September 2024 and a quarter percent in November 2024) have led to strong stock market performance in 2024. The icing on the cake for 2024 returns was Donald Trump's victory in the US Presidential Election in early November, sending major indices to all-time highs in the week following the election. Still, debates around the health of the economy and the impact of potential tariffs and corporate tax cuts remain. Said differently, there's still much uncertainty around 2025.
