Walden is applying novel, multi-disciplinary approaches that directly target the kidney to prevent damage, slow disease progression, and restore kidney function. Walden\u2019s programs address novel targets for therapeutic intervention, directly targeting two cell types critical for kidney function: podocytes and proximal tubular cells. Dysfunction of these cells are critical hallmarks of the majority of kidney diseases. Walden\u2019s clinical-stage program is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits suPAR, a cause of podocyte dysfunction and kidney disease, which is being evaluated in a Phase 2 Basket study. Walden\u2019s second most advanced program, a small molecule that is designed to stabilize and restore the function of dynamin, an enzyme responsible for the maintenance of the cytoskeletal architecture and function of podocytes and proximal tubule cells will begin a clinical study in 2025. All of Walden\u2019s programs offer the promise to deliver disease-modifying, breakthrough therapies that are readily combinable with the standard of care to transform the treatment of kidney disease.

Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 5:55 PM 3 min read In This Article: REC.V 0.00% Calgary, Alberta--(Newsfile Corp. - January 23, 2025) - Record Resources Inc. (TSXV: REC) is strongly impressed and highly encouraged by the drilling results of its Lake Temiskaming neighbour, Quebec Innovate Materials Corporation (QIMC) (see QIMC news release, January 21, 2025). \"From what we've seen, these are some of the best grades of any early-stage hydrogen exploration project,\" said Michael Judson, Record Resources CEO. \"Other explorers have reported 500 and 700 ppm measurements. QIMC hit 7000 ppm. This is another level.\" \"QIMC also made history. They are the first exploration company to drill shallow wells targeting natural hydrogen,\" said Judson. \"Everyone else has been doing soil samples. This drilling provides us with much more compelling data and more confidence regarding the geological occurrence.\" One shallow well drilled by QIMC reached a measurement 7,119 parts per million, plateauing at 2,886 ppm. Five other measurements included one of over 2,400 ppm, one of over 1,000 ppm and one of over 900 ppm.\" The results were recorded with wells drilled to shallow depths of up to 50 metres. The drilling locations in new fault zones inferred from electrical tomography imagery performed by the Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique during fall 2024. \"This achievement, despite the challenging very cold winter conditions, underscores the robustness of our geological and geophysical models, validating our geophysical identification of potentially advective fault zones as key areas for abundant natural hydrogen,\" stated John Karagiannidis, chief executive officer of Quebec Innovative,\" said John Karagiannidis, QIMC CEO, in a January 21, 2025 news release. Record's newly acquired Lorrain-Bucke hydrogen property (see company's January 14, 2025 news release) is contiguous with the QIMC on its western boundary in Lake Temiskaming in Ontario. Record's Lorrain-Bucke claim blocks are strategically located between major rift faults in the Lake Temiskaming Graben structure and directly adjacent to QIMC's St-Bruno-de-Guigues hydrogen project. (See figure 1). Record also corrects the date of expiration reported for the finder's warrants referenced in the company's December 30, 2024 news release regarding the closing of the company's 436,999.95 Private Placement. The correct exercise period is 24 months following the closing of the Offering, as follows: the company paid finders' fees and issued finders' shares and finders' warrants to EMD Financial Inc. consisting of: (i) cash finders' fees of 8 per cent of the gross proceeds of the offering; (ii) finders' shares in an amount equal of 4 per cent of the number of units issued pursuant to the offering; and (iii) finders' warrants in an amount equal of 4 per cent of the number of units issued pursuant to the offering, exercisable at a price of five cents per common share for a period of 24 months following the closing of the offering.

Launch of Caregiver Leave Benefit, Strengthening Inclusive Family-Friendly Offerings Business Wire Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 5:05 PM 5 min read Caregiver Leave Benefit to offer financially protected 10-day minimum leave to employees globally Primarily aimed to support the care of critically and terminally ill immediate family members Program to be introduced starting in 2025 on a market-by-market basis DARMSTADT, Germany, January 22, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, a leading science and technology company, today announced the introduction of a Caregiver Leave Benefit as an additional family-friendly offering for employees of the company and its affiliates. The new global benefit includes a minimum of ten days of financially protected leave. 1 This initiative builds on the recent rollout of the global Fertility Benefit at Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany and its affiliates, and advances the company\u2019s journey to provide an inclusive suite of benefits that support employees\u2019 holistic well-being. \"At our company, we recognize the vital role that caregivers play and understand what is required of those who take this on, alongside the day-to-day care of their families and work responsibilities. We can\u2019t always anticipate when a loved one needs extraordinary care. Any of us could find ourselves in such a situation at a moment's notice, and we want to take at least one worry off our employees by giving them the opportunity to focus on their family during this challenging time. Our employees who become caregivers live our values, exhibiting courage, respect, and a strong sense of duty. It is critical, and part of our commitment as an employer, to ensure that employees are supported, together, with the loved ones they care for,\" said Bel\u00e9n Garijo, Chair of the Executive Board and CEO of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. \"Our new Caregiver Leave Benefit is one more example of how we, at Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany and its affiliates, look holistically at our benefits offering to ensure the health and well-being of our employees no matter what stage they are in life,\" said Khadija Ben Hammada, Chief Human Resources Officer at Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. \"I am proud that we are further expanding our range of benefits. This way, we can give employees more time, space, and financial support for moments that matter.\" The Caregiver Leave Benefit is intended for use by those caring for immediate family members who are critically or terminally ill. This includes but is not limited to parents, children, and partners. The new benefit is expected to be rolled out globally over the next twelve months on a market-by-market basis, designed locally to include and integrate with any existing leave benefits or regulatory requirements that support employees in their individual situation. Story Continues Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, has a longstanding commitment to supporting caregivers and a close connection to this community through its Healthcare business. The 2017 launch of \" Embracing Carers \u00ae \" for caregivers around the world opened an avenue to enhance support and resources, including training and upskilling to benefit caregivers and their loved ones.

Targeting a $60 million fundraise, this innovative vehicle provides investors with diversified exposure to institutional-grade real estate opportunities, breaking down traditional barriers to entry. Historically, access to private real estate investing has been limited to institutional players or high-net-worth individuals with significant capital. The Parvis Direct Access Fund disrupts this model by enabling eligible and accredited investors to access top-performing real estate projects led by marquee developers. With a portfolio spanning multifamily housing, mixed-use developments, and hospitality the fund allows investors to benefit from long-term growth potential while enjoying the strategic diversification-an approach traditionally reserved for institutional investors. \"Real estate is a cornerstone of wealth creation, yet the best opportunities have often been out of reach for most Canadians,\" said David Michaud, CEO of Parvis. \"The Parvis Direct Access Fund is designed to change that. By delivering institutional-grade opportunities through a streamlined and inclusive structure, we're giving more investors the ability to build diversified portfolios and access the potential of Canada's real estate market.\" The PDAF follows a clear and strategic allocation plan, targeting value-add opportunities in high-demand markets. The fund targets 60% Multi-family , 20% Hospitality , 15% Mixed Use , and 5% Industrial projects , ensuring exposure to diverse real estate sectors that align with market trends and investor demand. Geographically, the fund is concentrated in Canada's high-growth regions, with 40% in Ontario , 20% in British Columbia , 20% in Quebec , and 10% in other provinces , reflecting a balanced approach to maximizing growth potential while mitigating risk.

Story Continues With an opportunistic and value-add approach, the Fund's strategic focus is on development and redevelopment projects that address critical housing supply challenges in urban centers while supporting the transformation of underutilized properties into vibrant, high-value assets. By partnering with leading builders and developers, the fund supports renovation, expansion, and new development initiatives that deliver strong potential returns while aligning with industry trends. The PDAF also enables foreign investors to access Canada's thriving real estate market, further expanding the fund's reach and appeal.

Jan 15, 2025, 6:00 PM 3 min read WALTHAM, Mass. , Jan. 15, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Accelerated Cure Project (ACP) for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) with generous support from EMD Serono's Embracing Caregivers initiative, announced today the launch of a new website designed to support the care partners of people living with MS. (PRNewsfoto/Accelerated Cure Project for Mu) The MS Care Partner Connection will provide users with important information about managing life with MS and links to carefully vetted and curated resources. Resources cover topics such as understanding MS and MS caregiving, self-care for care partners, navigating the health system, managing relationships, and financial planning. The site also features an Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbot to answer caregiving questions whenever users need them. \"The MS Care Partner Connection is the resource I wish I had when I was caring for my wife,\" says Jon Strum , host of the RealTalk MS podcast and Care Partner Advisory Board member. \"We struggled to find useful information and real support during her illness, and it took a heavy toll on us. I hope this resource will help others avoid some of the challenges we faced.\" The MS Care Partner Connection is the result of a collaborative effort by a team of MS care partners, clinicians, and researchers, spearheaded by ACP, via its iConquer MS people-powered research network, and generously funded by EMD Serono's Embracing Carers initiative. While not a substitute for professional advice, diagnosis, and treatment, each resource listed on the site has been carefully evaluated by the Advisory Board for accuracy and reliability, readability, and access. If users can't find an answer among these resources, the AI Caregiving Expert, an automated chatbot powered by ChatGPT offers helpful general advice and support. Whether users consider themselves a care partner, caregiver, support partner, spouse, or family member of someone living with MS, this site has been designed to connect users with useful and reliable information at any point in the caregiving journey. \"We're excited to provide such a valuable service to people who are caring for people with MS,\" says Sara Loud , CEO of Accelerated Cure Project for MS. \"These carefully vetted resources, which will be regularly reviewed and updated, promise to help caregivers find the information and support they need.\" CONTACT Melissa Glim, MPH Ogilvy Health Melissa.Glim@ogilvy.com About Accelerated Cure Project ACP ( www.acceleratedcure.org ) is a patient-founded non-profit organization dedicated to accelerating research efforts to improve the health, healthcare and quality of life of people affected by MS.

zero-emissions locomotive regulation Trains.com Staff Thu, Jan 16, 2025, 6:45 PM 3 min read The EMD Joule SD70J battery locomotive beginning testing at Pacific Harbor Line at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach was displayed at a May 4 graduation ceremony for locomotive engineers last year. David Lustig The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has scrapped its controversial rule that would have required the use of zero-emissions locomotives in the state beginning in 2030. The board informed the Environmental Protection Agency this week that it was withdrawing its requests to enforce zero-emissions rules covering trucks and locomotives. The move comes a week before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, who frequently criticized CARB\u2019s regulatory efforts to fight climate change and improve the state\u2019s air quality. \u201cWithdrawal is an important step given the uncertainty presented by the incoming administration that previously attacked California\u2019s programs to protect public health and the climate and has said it will continue to oppose those programs,\u201d CARB Chair Liane Randolph said in a statement Tuesday. Because CARB\u2019s regulations are stricter than those imposed on the federal level, the agency requires waivers from the EPA in order to enforce them. CARB is no longer pursuing the waivers for the in-use locomotive rule or regulations that would have phased out diesel-powered trucks. The CARB regulation, which went into effect last year but was on hold pending EPA approval, would have banned any locomotive that is 23 years or older from operating in California. The regulation set dates after which all locomotives with engines built after certain years must operate in a \u201czero emission configuration.\u201d Under the rule, railroads operating in California would have had to begin contributing to a spending account where money would be set aside for the acquisition of zero-emission locomotives. The Association of American Railroads opposed the regulation and challenged it in federal court. The rule would mandate investments in locomotives that aren\u2019t yet commercially viable while limiting the lifespans of more than 25,000 diesel-electric locomotives currently in use, the AAR said. The trade group also argues that the CARB regulation violates the Clean Air Act, would put some short-line railroads out of business and would hurt the supply chain in California and beyond. BNSF Railway has said the CARB regulation threatened the viability of its proposed $1.5 billion Barstow International Gateway intermodal terminal. \u201cWe are encouraged that CARB has pulled down their request for a waiver with the EPA,\u201d CEO Katie Farmer said Wednesday morning at the Midwest Association of Rail Shippers conference. Farmer thanked those in attendance who wrote elected officials about what she called a \u201cmisguided regulation\u201d and said the railway now has a path to move forward with its investment in Barstow, where it aims to gather container traffic from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. At Barstow, the imported cargo would be sorted and transloaded into domestic containers at on-site facilities, then sent east on double-stack trains. Story Continues \u201cI\u2019m incredibly encouraged by the idea now that we can continue to have good dialogue with the state of California,\u201d Farmer said. \u201cWe continually talk to the state of California about our investment at Barstow.\u201d The AAR welcomed CARB\u2019s decision to abandon the locomotive rule. \u201cRailroads are pleased that the California Air Resources Board has withdrawn its authorization request for the ill-conceived in-use locomotive rule,\u201d AAR spokeswoman Jessica Kahanek said in a statement. \u201cAs we move past this untenable proposal, railroads look forward to advancing their already strong sustainability profile and further reducing emissions in the years to come.\u201d Note: Updated at 10:07 a.m. with comments from BNSF CEO Katie Farmer.

Story Continues Request a sample and discover the recent advances in NSCLC treatment drugs @ Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Pipeline Report The NSCLC pipeline report provides detailed profiles of pipeline assets, a comparative analysis of clinical and non-clinical stage NSCLC drugs, inactive and dormant assets, a comprehensive assessment of driving and restraining factors, and an assessment of opportunities and risks in the NSCLC clinical trial landscape. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Overview Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most prevalent form of lung cancer, originating in the tissues of the lungs. Unlike small cell lung cancer, which grows rapidly, NSCLC typically develops more slowly but often spreads to other parts of the body by the time it is diagnosed, emphasizing the need for early detection and treatment. Small-cell lung cancer derives its name from the small, round appearance of its cells under a microscope, while the cells in NSCLC are larger. Despite its slower growth, NSCLC is frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage, further underscoring the importance of early intervention. In the United States , approximately 230,000 people are diagnosed with lung cancer annually, and it accounts for an estimated 135,000 deaths each year. Lung cancer causes more deaths than prostate, breast, brain, and colorectal cancers combined. It is the leading cause of cancer deaths in men and the second most common in women. However, these figures are declining, largely due to anti-smoking initiatives and reduced tobacco use. The classification of lung tumors is based on the 2015 World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, which utilize immunohistochemistry and light microscopy to guide treatment decisions and predict outcomes. NSCLC encompasses several subtypes, including adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma, the most common subtype, accounts for nearly half of all lung cancer cases. Squamous cell carcinoma, once the most prevalent, typically originates in the tracheobronchial tree but is now more frequently found in peripheral lung areas. Large cell carcinoma is a diagnosis of exclusion, characterized by poor differentiation and lack of specific classification through immunohistochemistry or electron microscopy. The causes of NSCLC can be divided into avoidable and unavoidable risk factors. Tobacco use remains the most significant preventable risk factor, while other causes include alcohol consumption, exposure to secondhand smoke, asbestos, radon, arsenic, chromium, nickel, ionizing radiation, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Diagnosis involves a comprehensive blood count (CBC), a complete metabolic panel (CMP), and imaging studies. Hypercalcemia or elevated alkaline phosphatase may indicate metastasis to bones. Initial imaging with a chest X-ray can help identify nonspecific signs, followed by computed tomography (CT) for detailed characterization. A tissue biopsy is essential for confirming the diagnosis through histopathologic and immunohistochemistry evaluation. Treatment options for NSCLC include standard therapies like surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, as well as newer approaches like laser therapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and cryosurgery. The choice of treatment depends on the cancer's stage, the patient's functional status, comorbidities, and the molecular characteristics of the tumor. Surgery is often required for localized cases, while advanced stages may call for a combination of therapies. Participation in clinical trials can also offer access to emerging treatments. Managing NSCLC requires a collaborative, interprofessional approach, beginning with prevention. Primary care providers play a critical role in smoking cessation counseling and early detection through lung cancer screening, which can improve prognosis by identifying the disease before it progresses to advanced stages.

storm into Chad's presidential palace but 18 of the attackers and two soldiers were killed in the failed attack, the national prosecutor said Thursday. Heavy gunfire erupted near the presidential complex just before 8:00 pm local time (1900 GMT) on Wednesday in the centre of N'Djamena, the capital of the military-ruled, central African country. Roads leading to the presidential palace were blocked and tanks could be seen on the streets, an AFP reporter at the scene said at the time. Government spokesman and foreign minister Abderaman Koulamallah said a 24-member commando unit carrying \"weapons, machetes and knives\" attacked the guards of the presidential palace before being swiftly stopped. They \"shammed a car breakdown to attack the guards in front of the gates of the presidential palace,\" state prosecutor Oumar Kedelaye said. \"They killed two soldiers and seriously wounded five others,\" he said, adding that 18 assailants were killed and six were wounded. President Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno was inside the palace at the time of the attack, the motive for which was still unclear. Deby was propelled to power after rebels killed his father Idriss Deby in 2021. The older Deby had ruled Chad with an iron fist since a coup in the early 1990s. The group was dressed in civilian clothing and came from a poor neighbourhood in the south of the city, Koulamallah said, describing them as drunken \"Pieds Nickeles\" -- a reference to a French comic featuring hapless crooks. He said they were high on alcohol and drugs. \"The situation is completely under control... The destabilisation attempt was put down,\" he said, in a video posted on Facebook hours after the shooting, surrounded by soldiers and with a gun at his belt. Questioned later on national television, Koulamallah said the attack was \"probably not terrorist\". Beefed-up security and road blocks set up late on Wednesday had been lifted the following morning around the presidential palace, where traffic was back to normal, AFP journalists saw. - 'Set up' - Chad faces recurring attacks by the jihadist group Boko Haram in the Lake Chad region and abruptly ended a military accord with former colonial power France in late November. Like other former French colonies, Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger who have forced French forces to pull out of their countries, Chad has sought closer ties with Russia. Moscow \"strongly condemns\" the attack in N'Djamena \"directed against the legitimate leadership\" of Chad, the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement Thursday. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, an ally of Moscow, in a message on X also voiced support for Chad after the attack. Story Continues Hours before the shootout, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met Deby and other senior officials before leaving Chad to continue his tour of African countries in neighbouring Nigeria. Videos circulating on social media claiming to have been filmed by soldiers at the entrance to the presidential palace showed security forces moving among bloodied corpses lying on the ground. Other people could be seen alive and sitting on the ground, tied up. They all appeared to be young men in civilian clothes. An opposition figure voiced doubts about the government's account of events. Max Kemkoye, spokesman for the Political Actors' Consultation Group (GCAP), spoke on Thursday of an \"unfortunate synopsis\" and a \"set up\" orchestrated by those in power. The attack comes less than two weeks after Chad held a general election that the government hailed as a key step towards ending military rule but that was marked by low turnout and the opposition's call for a boycott amid allegations of fraud. Deby won a five-year presidential mandate last May in a vote the opposition also denounced as fraudulent. Chad gained independence from France in 1960 but the ensuing three decades were marred by instability, oppression, civil war and a Libyan invasion. hpn-emd/ach-kjm View Comments Terms and Privacy
