Quote Q4 Earnings Whispers for HIG Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Hartford Financial this time around. The combination of a positive\u00a0Earnings ESP\u00a0and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below. Earnings ESP: Hartford Financial has an Earnings ESP of -3.21%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate currently is $2.58 per share, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.67.

Now, let us see how things have shaped up before the fourth-quarter earnings announcement. Factors to Note Hartford Financial's top line is expected to have witnessed growth in the fourth quarter, driven by higher premiums across its Commercial Lines, Personal Lines, and Group Benefits businesses. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total net premiums earned is pegged at $5.9 billion, reflecting a 7.7% increase compared to the same quarter last year. For the Personal Lines business, rising premiums are expected to boost results. The homeowners\u2019 insurance segment is likely to have benefited from new product offerings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Personal Lines earned premiums is pegged at $889.1 million, representing a 10.6% increase year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Income before taxes for this business is $65 million, implying a year-over-year increase of 54.8%. Earned pricing increases and outpacing loss cost trends are expected to have benefited this business. Story Continues In the Commercial Lines segment, consistent rate hikes, new business expansion, strong retention, and solid submission volumes are likely to have contributed to growth, although this may have been partially offset by catastrophe losses affecting underwriting results. The consensus estimate for earned premiums in this segment is $3.3 billion, suggesting a 9.7% rise from the prior-year quarter. The Group Benefits segment is likely to have been supported by growth in fully insured ongoing premiums, improved mortality trends, and strong long-term disability claim recoveries. The consensus estimate for the segment\u2019s revenues is pegged at $1.8 billion, reflecting a nearly 1% increase from the prior-year period. Additionally, Hartford Financial\u2019s fourth-quarter investment performance may have benefited from higher returns in its private equity and real estate portfolio. These might have helped the company\u2019s fourth-quarter results. However, the bottom line is expected to have been pressured by rising benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses, as well as higher insurance operating costs. HIG\u2019s margins are also likely to have been impacted by ongoing investments in digital, analytics and data science capabilities. Commercial Line, Personal Line and Group Benefits business\u2019s expense ratio is expected to have deteriorated by 470, 223 and 59 basis points, respectively, in the fourth quarter.

{"text": "Bread Financial Holdings (BFH) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy? Zacks Equity Research Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 6:00 PM 4 min read In This Article: BFH -0.32% Bread Financial Holdings (BFH) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price. The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 30, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This manager of loyalty and rewards programs for retailers and others is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.34 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -62.2%. Revenues are expected to be $957.24 million, down 5.9% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 12.57% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts. Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction). The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. La historia contin\u00faa A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Bread Financial? For Bread Financial, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +25.94%. On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2. So, this combination indicates that Bread Financial will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue? While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Bread Financial would post earnings of $1.88 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.84, delivering a surprise of -2.13%. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times. Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Bread Financial appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

{"text": "Bread Financial Trades Above 50-Day SMA: Time to Buy the Stock? Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 8:00 PM 3 min read In This Article: BFH -0.32% Bread Financial Holdings, Inc. BFH has been trading above its 50-day simple moving average (SMA), signaling a short-term bullish trend. Its share price, as of Jan. 21, 2025, was $63.75, down 4.4% from its 52-week high of $66.71. The 50-day SMA is a key indicator for traders and analysts to identify support and resistance levels. It is considered particularly important as this is the first marker of an uptrend or downtrend. With a market capitalization of $3.16 billion, BFH is set to gain from solid credit sales, proactive risk management, financial flexibility, prudent capital deployment and higher return on capital. BFH Trading Above 50-Day Moving Average Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research BFH is an Outperformer Shares of Bread Financial have surged 107.3% in the past year, outperforming its industry, the Finance sector and the Zacks S&P 500 composite\u2019s growth of 22.7%, 25% and 24.3%, respectively. BFH Outperformed Industry, Sector and S&P 500 in 1 Year Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research BFH Shares are Affordable BFH shares are trading at a discount to the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry.

Optimistic Analyst Sentiment on BFH Three of the seven analysts covering the stock have raised estimates for 2025 over the past 30 days. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 moved 0.7% north in the last 30 days. BFH\u2019s Return on Capital The return on invested capital in the trailing 12-months was 10%, better than the industry average of 4.9%, reflecting the company\u2019s efficiency in utilizing funds to generate income. Factors Acting in Favor of BFH The credit sales performance is expected to improve on the back of solid consumer spending. With the continued growth of credit sales, average loans are likely to increase. With new partner additions and holiday spending, BFH continues to expect strong credit sales. Credit metrics should remain strong with delinquency and net loss rates remaining below the historical averages. Given disciplined, proactive risk management and strong consumer payment behavior, net loss rates are expected to remain low. BFH is prudently investing in strategic growth areas and ramping up marketing spending in growth verticals and digital innovation and technology enhancements. Bread Financial stated that ramping up its digital and technology capabilities remains a top priority this year. It has strategic relationships leveraging BFH\u2019s versatile mono platform, including RBC, Fiserv and Sezzle. The company has been strengthening its balance sheet and lowering debt. Notably, its free cash flow conversion has been impressive over the last several quarters, reflecting its solid earnings. Bread Financial also intends to pay down $100 million remaining in 2026 bonds by this year to further improve leverage. BFH remains focused on returning value to its shareholders. It uses share repurchases as a tool to mitigate the adverse impact of foreign exchange and intends to focus more on share buybacks and mergers and acquisitions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Bread Financial\u2019s 2025 revenues indicates a year-over-year increase of 3% from the corresponding 2024 estimates. BFH has a solid track record of beating earnings estimates in two of the last four quarters and missed in the other two, the average being 70.23%. Story Continues Conclusion Robust credit sales, higher retained earnings, active risk management, solid consumer spending and capital deployment should continue to favor Bread Financial over the long term.

RenaissanceRe's top line is likely to have benefited from higher premiums earned in its Property, and Casualty and Specialty segments in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for overall net premiums earned is pegged at $2.6 billion, which indicates a 13.9% rise from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported figure. Improved net investment income is likely to have contributed to RNR\u2019s revenues. The revenue component is expected to have been aided by an increase in average invested assets and higher returns from its fixed maturity and short-term portfolios in the fourth quarter. The consensus mark for net investment income is pegged at $430.3 million, indicating a 14.2% rise from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported number. Our estimate for the metric is pinned at $430.5 million. Story Continues Results of the Property unit are likely to have benefited from increased demand for reinsurance and a favorable rate environment in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment\u2019s net premiums earned is pegged at $969.8 million, which implies a 9.7% rise from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported figure. Meanwhile, strength in other specialty business line is expected to have driven the Casualty and Specialty segment\u2019s performance. The consensus mark for the unit\u2019s net premiums earned is pegged at $1.6 billion, suggesting 15.4% growth from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported number. However, the continued incidence of catastrophe losses may have dampened the underwriting results of RenaissanceRe and is expected to have led to a deterioration in the combined ratio in the fourth quarter. We anticipate the company\u2019s overall underwriting income to decline 71.3% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the combined ratio is pinned at 92.6%, which indicates a deterioration of 1,659 basis points year over year.

{"text": "Can Synchrony Beat Q4 Earnings Estimates on Improving Efficiency? Zacks Equity Research Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 7:34 PM 5 min read In This Article: SYF-PB +0.38% Consumer financial services company, Synchrony Financial SYF, is set to report fourth-quarter 2024 results on Jan. 28, 2025, before the opening bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter\u2019s earnings is currently pegged at $1.90 per share on revenues of $4.57 billion. See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news. The fourth-quarter earnings\u00a0estimate has moved north by 2 cents over the past month. The bottom-line projection indicates a year-over-year increase of 84.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues suggests year-over-year growth of 2.2%. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Synchrony\u2019s revenues is pegged at $17.98 billion, implying a rise of 5.4% year over year. Also, the consensus mark for current year EPS is pegged at $6.54, implying a jump of around 26% on a year-over-year basis. SYF beat the consensus estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters and missed once, with the average surprise being 4.5%. Synchrony Financial Price and EPS Surprise Synchrony Financial Price and EPS Surprise Synchrony Financial price-eps-surprise | Synchrony Financial Quote Q4 Earnings Whispers for SYF Our proven model predicts a likely earnings beat for the company this time around. The combination of a positive\u00a0Earnings ESP\u00a0and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That\u2019s precisely the case here. Synchronyhas an Earnings ESP of +0.96% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our\u00a0Earnings ESP Filter. What\u2019s Shaping SYF\u2019s Q4 Results? Synchrony is expected to have seen advantages in the fourth quarter from increased loan receivables, improving efficiency ratio and average active accounts. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net interest income indicates 3.4% year-over-year growth, while our estimate predicts a 3.1% increase. Our model predicts an increase in interest and fees on loans to over $5.5billion from $5.3 billion a year ago. SYF is expected to have continued gaining from digital sales volume in the to-be-reported quarter. Both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate suggest that the total average active accounts are likely to have risen more than 2% year over year in the fourth quarter. The financial service provider is expected to have witnessed an increase in Average Interest-Earning Assets . The consensus estimate indicates a 6.5% increase in the metric from the year-ago period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the efficiency ratio is pegged at 34.80%, indicating an improvement from the prior-year reported figure of 36%. Story Continues The above-mentioned factors are likely to have benefited the company in the fourth quarter, positioning it for not only year-over-year growth but also an earnings beat. However, Synchrony is expected to have incurred increased information processing, employee costs and professional fees in the fourth quarter and witnessed lower purchase volumes, partially offsetting the positives. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Synchrony\u2019s total purchase volumes for the quarter under review indicates a decline of nearly 3% year over year, while our model predicts an almost 2% fall. The volatile economic environment may have discouraged certain transactions, especially big-ticket items, potentially constraining SYF's ability to realize its full portfolio growth potential. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net interest margin is pegged at 14.73%, while our estimate suggests a net interest margin of 14.02%, down from 15.10% achieved a year ago, lowering its profitability. The net charge-offs are also likely to have substantially risen in the quarter under review. Other Stocks That Warrant a Look Here are some other companies worth considering from the broader finance\u00a0space, as our model shows that these, too, have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around: Rithm Capital Corp.

for Eli Lilly, Exxon Mobil & Costco Mark Vickery Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 12:29 AM 7 min read In This Article: COST +2.65% LLY -0.08% XOM +0.24% Wednesday, January 22, 2025 The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST), as well a micro-cap stock Flanigan's Enterprises, Inc. (BDL). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today. You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>> Eli Lilly\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+18.2% vs. -1.7%). Demand for the company\u2019s popular GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, remains strong, making them the company\u2019s key top-line drivers. Its new drugs contributed significantly to top-line growth in 2024. Lilly is also making rapid pipeline progress in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s. However, sales of Mounjaro/Zepbound were disappointing in the second half of 2024 due to slower-than-expected growth, which has raised concerns about moderating demand for the drugs. Declining sales of Trulicity, rising pricing pressure on some drugs and potential competition in the GLP-1 diabetes/obesity market are some top-line headwinds. Estimates have declined ahead of fourth-quarter results. Lilly has a mixed record of earnings surprises in recent quarters. (You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here >>> ) Shares of Exxon Mobil have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+19.6% vs. +14.5%). The company\u2019s high-value assets in the Permian Basin and Guyana drive robust production growth, doubling upstream earnings since 2019. The Pioneer acquisition and Guyana ramp-up have enhanced profitability, while a robust structural savings strengthen resilience. With a lower exposure to debt capital, XOM supports steady cash flows, dividends, buybacks and investments in high-return projects. Expansion in low-carbon tech, including Baytown's hydrogen facility, positions it for future growth. Yet, refining margins are pressured due to global capacity increases, with refining profits softening. The refining margin pressure intensifies the reliance on upstream operations which is vulnerable to fluctuating oil and gas prices. Commodity price volatility challenges profitability, especially as crude prices dipped in the third quarter. (You can read the full research report on Exxon Mobil here >>> ) Costco\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry over the past year (+43.3% vs. +23.6%). The company being a consumer defensive stock, Costco has been surviving the market turmoil pretty well. The discount retailer\u2019s key strengths are strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives, and an emphasis on membership growth. These factors have been helping it register decent sales and earnings numbers. The Zacks analyst expects Costco to register an 11.5% adjusted earnings per share improvement in fiscal 2025 on 6.6% revenue growth. This outlook reflects Costco\u2019s ability to navigate the challenging operating environment, generate solid sales, and register high membership renewal rates. A favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing power, and strong liquidity position should help Costco keep outperforming. While trading at a premium to its peers, its long-term growth prospects should help the stock see a solid upside. (You can read the full research report on Costco here >>> ) Shares of Flanigan's have underperformed the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry over the past year (-3.1% vs. +6.3%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $46.45 million is facing risks which include a 16.1% net income decline, inflation-driven margin pressure, flat franchise revenue and geographic concentration. Regulatory challenges, high competition and limited diversification further weigh on prospects. Nonetheless, the package store segment and steady rental income provide stability. Flanigan's achieved 7.9% revenue growth to $188.3 million in fiscal 2024 from $174.4 million in the prior year, driven by a 6.3% rise in restaurant sales and 15.1% growth in package store sales, showcasing a diversified revenue model. Geographic expansion opportunities, resilient operations amid cost pressures, and rising dine-in demand position the company for long-term growth. Operational efficiencies help combat rising costs, while digital transformation and menu innovation could enhance customer experience and loyalty.

(INFY). Mark Vickery Senior Editor Note: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

Aerospace Unit Aids Parker-Hannifin (PH) Amid Weak Liquidity Per the Zacks analyst, Parker-Hannifin will benefit from strength in Aerospace Systems segment, led by robust OEM and aftermarket demand. However, weak liquidity position remains concerning. CNG Vehicles Aid Republic Services (RSG) Amid Low Liquidity Per the Zacks analyst, Republic Services is focused on increasing its operational efficiency by shifting to compressed natural gas (CNG) collection vehicles. Low liquidity remains a concern. Solid Budget Aids Curtiss-Wright (CW) Amid Fuel Price Hike Per the Zacks analyst, increasing U.S. defense budget should boost demand for Curtiss-Wright's nuclear propulsion equipment. Yet rising fuel price might hurt airline industry and in turn the stock RH Benefits From Innovation Amid Macroeconomic Challenges The Zacks analyst believes that product innovation, global expansion, experiential retail, and technology will benefit RH. Yet, slow real estate market dampens sales.

Credit Sales, Receivables Growth Drive Bread Financial (BFH) Per the Zacks analyst, Bread Financial is set to grow on credit sales growth driven by existing partners, as well as new product and brand partner additions.

A solid liquidity position is an added advantage. Telephone and Data Systems (TDS) Rides on Strong Fiber Growth Per the Zacks analyst, solid growth in residential broadband connections will likely boost Telephone and Data Systems' top line. Strong emphasis on fiber network expansion is a tailwind. New Downgrades Weak Demand, Low Steel Margins Ail Commercial Metals (CMC) Per the Zacks Analyst, Commercial Metals is bearing the brunt of lower steel product margins over scrap costs. Sluggish demand in Europe is also putting pressure on pricing and margins. Rising Expenses & Net Outflows Hurt Artisan Partners (APAM) Per the Zacks analyst, rising expenses from higher revenue-based incentive compensation are likely to hurt Artisan Partner's bottom line, while rising net outflows are likely to hurt its AUM growth. Changing Marketplace Conditions Ail AMN Healthcare (AMN) The Zacks analyst is worried about AMN Healthcare's ability to adapt to changing marketplace conditions in evolving care delivery settings. A tough competitive space is an added concern. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.
