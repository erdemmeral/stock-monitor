[{"text": "Covenant Logistics Group Announces Fourth Quarter Financial and Operating Results Covenant Logistics Group, Inc. Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 12:05 AM 25 min read In This Article: CVLG -2.38% Covenant Logistics Group, Inc. CHATTANOOGA, Tenn., Jan. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Covenant Logistics Group, Inc. (NYSE: CVLG) (\u201cCovenant\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) announced today financial and operating results for the fourth\u00a0quarter ended\u00a0December 31, 2024. The Company\u2019s conference call to discuss the quarter will be held at 10:00 A.M. Eastern Time on Friday,\u00a0January 24, 2025. All references made to share or per share amounts in this press release have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of our recent 2-for-1 stock split. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David R. Parker, commented: \u201cWe are pleased to report fourth quarter earnings of $0.24 per diluted share and non-GAAP adjusted earnings of $0.49 per diluted share, on 27.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding after giving effect to our recent 2-for-1 stock split. These results mark the end of another successful year despite a challenging general freight environment, and I could not be happier with how our team has planned and adjusted throughout the year. \u201cThe fourth quarter once again highlighted the impact of our diversified business model. This quarter, our Dedicated segment's adjusted profitability fell short of our expectations due to greater-than-anticipated temporary customer shutdowns and volume reductions, as well as higher costs related to guaranteed driver pay and a large current period casualty claim expense. However, our asset-light segments, including Managed Freight and Warehousing, outperformed expectations by providing overflow capacity for our asset-based segments, executing on peak opportunities, and focusing on cost control. Additionally, our Expedited segment capitalized on a better peak season and improved network balance to deliver solid results on a smaller fleet. \u201cOur 49% equity method investment with Transport Enterprise Leasing (TEL) contributed pre-tax net income of $3.0 million, or $0.08 per share, compared to $4.7 million, or $0.13 per share, in the same quarter of 2023. The decrease in pre-tax net income for TEL was primarily due to softening of the equipment market, which suppressed gains on the sale of used equipment, and increased interest expense associated with higher interest rates on equipment-related debt.\u201d A summary of our fourth quarter financial performance: Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, ($000s, except per share information) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Total Revenue $ 277,331 $ 273,985 $ 1,131,476 $ 1,103,573 Freight Revenue, Excludes Fuel Surcharge $ 251,145 $ 240,006 $ 1,013,941 $ 970,509 Operating Income $ 8,613 $ 14,267 $ 44,760 $ 58,823 Adjusted Operating Income (1) $ 17,943 $ 17,132 $ 70,740 $ 63,846 Operating Ratio 96.9 % 94.8 % 96.0 % 94.7 % Adjusted Operating Ratio (1) 92.9 % 92.9 % 93.0 % 93.4 % Net Income $ 6,720 $ 12,795 $ 35,921 $ 55,229 Adjusted Net Income (1) $ 13,687 $ 14,791 $ 54,977 $ 57,508 Earnings per Diluted Share $ 0.24 $ 0.47 $ 1.30 $ 2.00 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share (1) $ 0.49 $ 0.55 $ 1.98 $ 2.08 (1) Represents non-GAAP measures.

Combined Truckload Revenue Paul Bunn, the Company\u2019s President commented on truckload operations, \u201cFor the quarter, total revenue in our truckload operations\u00a0increased\u00a03.5%, to $190.4 million, compared to 2023. The increase\u00a0in total revenue\u00a0consisted of\u00a0$14.1 million\u00a0more freight revenue, partially offset by $7.7 million\u00a0less fuel surcharge revenue.\u00a0The increase in freight revenue primarily related to operating 158 or 7.4% more average tractors combined with an increase in freight revenue per total mile, partially offset by a reduction in utilization compared to the prior year.\u201d Story Continues Expedited Truckload Revenue Mr. Bunn added, \u201cFreight revenue in our Expedited segment\u00a0decreased\u00a0$0.7 million, or 0.8%. Average total tractors decreased\u00a0by\u00a040 units to 875, compared to\u00a0915 in the prior year quarter. Average freight revenue per tractor per week\u00a0increased\u00a03.8%\u00a0as a result of a 1.6% increase in freight revenue per total mile and a 2.2% increase in utilization.\u201d Dedicated Truckload Revenue \u201cFor the quarter, freight revenue in our Dedicated segment\u00a0increased\u00a0$14.8 million, or 22.4%. Average total tractors\u00a0increased by\u00a0198 units or 13.2%\u00a0to 1,424, compared to\u00a01,226 in the prior year quarter. Average freight revenue per tractor per week\u00a0increased\u00a05.4% as a result of a 13.2% increase in freight revenue per total mile partially offset by a 6.9% decrease in utilization.\u201d Combined Truckload Operating Expenses Mr. Bunn continued, \u201cOperating expenses in our combined truckload segments were a significant headwind for us in the quarter. Compared to the prior year, our truckload operating cost increased 18 cents, or 6.6%, on a per total mile basis. The drivers of the increase primarily include salaries and wages associated with driver pay, increased operations and maintenance costs to operate our equipment, increased insurance expense associated with current period auto liability claims, increased depreciation expense associated with higher prices of newer equipment, and the recognition of a $6.3 million expense associated with an earnout payment related to our 2023 acquisition of Lew Thompson & Son (which we have chosen to exclude from our non-GAAP adjusted results). \u201cSalaries, wages and related expenses increased year-over-year by 13 cents, or approximately 10%, on a per total mile basis. The increase was driven primarily from the year-over-year impact of significant growth in our dedicated protein supply chain business. As we grow our dedicated fleet in niche services, it requires hiring and retaining skilled drivers to operate specialized equipment on loads that typically have a shorter length of haul, resulting in higher costs on a per total mile basis. \u201cOperations and maintenance expenses increased 2 cents per total mile, or approximately 13%, compared to the prior year. The primary factors driving the growth relate to a combination of an increase in parts and service to repair equipment that experienced an unusually large amount of damage in the quarter. \u201cInsurance and claims expense increased by 2 cents, or approximately 11%, on a per total mile basis, compared to the prior year quarter as a result of a large current period claims incurred. Given our self-insurance limits, the amount of expense recognized from period to period can fluctuate. \u201cFixed expenses related to revenue producing equipment, including leased and rented equipment, depreciation, and gain on sale increased slightly by 1 cent on a per total mile basis, compared to the prior year quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we recognized a slight gain on sale of equipment of $0.1 million, compared to a gain of $0.2 million in the prior year quarter.\u201d Managed Freight Segment Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, ($000s) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Freight Revenue $ 62,271 $ 65,035 $ 248,939 $ 258,903 Operating Income $ 4,232 $ 2,484 $ 12,282 $ 9,388 Adj. Operating Income (1) $ 5,152 $ 2,748 $ 13,995 $ 9,924 Operating Ratio 93.2 % 96.2 % 95.1 % 96.4 % Adj. Operating Ratio (1) 91.7 % 95.8 % 94.4 % 96.2 % (1)\u00a0Represents non-GAAP measures. \u201cFor the quarter, Managed Freight\u2019s freight revenue\u00a0decreased\u00a04.3%, from the prior year quarter. However, operating income\u00a0and adjusted operating income improved approximately 87%\u00a0compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. This year over year improvement in margin is attributable to the team\u2019s effort to identify and execute on profitable freight, assist the Expedited fleet with network imbalances experienced early in the quarter, and a better than anticipated benefit from peak related freight.\u201d Warehousing Segment Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, ($000s) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Freight Revenue $ 24,395 $ 24,604 $ 100,518 $ 99,362 Operating Income $ 2,002 $ 1,190 $ 7,898 $ 2,862 Adj. Operating Income (1) $ 2,261 $ 1,449 $ 8,934 $ 3,977 Operating Ratio 91.9 % 95.2 % 92.2 % 97.2 % Adj. Operating Ratio (1) 90.7 % 94.1 % 91.1 % 96.0 % (1)\u00a0Represents non-GAAP measures. \u201cFor the quarter, Warehousing\u2019s freight revenue\u00a0decreased\u00a00.8% versus the prior year quarter. Operating income and adjusted operating income for the Warehousing segment\u00a0increased $0.8 million\u00a0compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, as a result of improvements to direct labor costs\u00a0and the year over year impact of customer rate increases that have taken effect.\u201d Capitalization, Liquidity and Capital Expenditures Tripp Grant, the Company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, added the following comments: \u201cAt December 31, 2024, our total net indebtedness decreased\u00a0by\u00a0$28.7 million to approximately\u00a0$219.6 million\u00a0as compared to December 31, 2023. In addition, our net indebtedness to total capitalization\u00a0decreased to\u00a033.4% at December 31, 2024\u00a0from\u00a038.1% at December 31, 2023. \u201cOur capital allocation for the year included a $10 million earnout payment related to the achievement of certain milestones of AAT, approximately $103 million toward planned net capital expenditures in tractors and trailers allowing us to optimize the average age of our fleet and grow our dedicated business and approximately $6 million in dividend payments. \u201cAt December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $35.6 million. Under our ABL credit facility, we had no borrowings outstanding, undrawn letters of credit outstanding of $19.8 million, and available borrowing capacity of $90.2 million. The sole financial covenant under our ABL facility is a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant that is tested only when available borrowing capacity is below a certain threshold. Based on availability as of December 31, 2024, no testing was required, and we do not expect testing to be required in the foreseeable future. \u201cAt the end of the quarter, we had $0.1 million in assets held for sale that we anticipate disposing of within twelve months. The average age of our tractors slightly increased to 20 months compared to 19 months a year ago. \u201cOur baseline expectation for net capital equipment expenditures in 2025 is $70 million to $80 million and reflects our priorities of growing our dedicated footprint, maintaining the average age of our fleet in a manner that allows us to optimize operational uptime and related operating costs, and offering a fleet of equipment that our professional drivers are proud to operate. We expect the benefits of improved utilization, fuel economy and maintenance costs to produce acceptable returns despite increased prices of new equipment and potentially lower values of used equipment.\u201d Outlook Mr. Parker concluded, \u201cFor the quarter, the general freight market appears to be incrementally improving as capacity and demand are better balanced than they have been for approximately two years, and customers are acknowledging this during rate and volume allocation discussions. However, in our dedicated markets, customers continue to experience greater than expected temporary customer shutdowns and volume pressure. Additionally, bad weather has hampered operations and increased our costs during January, limiting any benefit of general market uplift. Beyond the first quarter, we are focusing on positioning the Company to execute quickly and gain operating leverage as conditions improve, continuing to capture new dedicated contracts to expand the fleet organically, and evaluating multiple acquisition and investment opportunities. Our goal remains to grow profitably and generate meaningful returns for our stockholders while providing world-class career opportunities for our team members.\u201d Conference Call Information The Company will host a live conference call tomorrow, January 24, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time to discuss the quarter.

Primary services include asset- based expedited and dedicated truckload capacity, as well as asset-light warehousing, transportation management, and freight brokerage capability. In addition, Transport Enterprise Leasing is an affiliated company providing revenue equipment sales and leasing services to the trucking industry. Covenant's Class A common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, \u201cCVLG.\u201d (1) See GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation in the schedules included with this release. In addition to operating income (loss), operating ratio, net income, and earnings per diluted share, we use adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted operating ratio, adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP measures, as key measures of profitability. Adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted operating ratio, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share are not substitutes for operating income (loss), operating ratio, net income, and earnings per diluted share measured in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. We believe our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because it provides investors and securities analysts with supplemental information that we use internally for purposes of assessing profitability. Further, our Board and management use non-GAAP operating income (loss), operating ratio, net income, and earnings per diluted share measures on a supplemental basis to remove items that may not be an indicator of performance from period-to-period. Although we believe that adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted operating ratio, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share improves comparability in analyzing our period-to-period performance, they could limit comparability to other companies in our industry, if those companies define such measures differently. Because of these limitations, adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted operating ratio, adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per diluted share should not be considered measures of income generated by our business or discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures on a supplemental basis.

Kinjel Shah Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 11:00 PM 6 min read In This Article: VRTX +1.88% Key Takeaways Vertex Pharmaceuticals stock declined almost 13% in six months due to poor test results for a new drug. When it comes to the drug and biotech sector, a major pipeline setback can hit the stock hard. In the past year, Vertex's stock has risen 0.1% against the industry's 3.4% decrease. The stock of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated VRTX has declined almost 13% in the past six months. A key reason for the stock price decline was unimpressive data from a phase II study on its key pipeline candidate, suzetrigine, for painful lumbosacral radiculopathy (LSR), a form of peripheral neuropathic pain, which showed largely undifferentiated pain reduction from placebo. Despite the unimpressive data in phase II, management decided to forge ahead to a phase III study in this indication, which is considered a risky decision. When it comes to the drug and biotech sector, a major pipeline setback can hit the stock hard. So, it becomes important to understand the company\u2019s strengths and weaknesses to better analyze how to play the stock given the recent dip in price. Consistent Rise in VRTX\u2019s CF Product Sales Vertex\u2019s cystic franchise (\u201cCF\u201d) sales continue to grow, driven by higher sales of Trikafta/Kaftrio in younger age groups. In the first nine months of 2024, Vertex\u2019s revenues rose 10%. While in the near term, expansion to younger age groups should continue to drive CF sales growth, the launch of Vertex\u2019s fifth CFTR modulator therapy, Alyftrek or vanza triple, should drive growth in the medium term. Alyftrek (vanza triple), a next-in-class triple combination regimen for treating people with CF aged six years and older, was approved by the FDA in December 2024. Casgevy Diversifies VRTX\u2019s Commercial Opportunity Vertex and partner CRISPR Therapeutics \u2019 CRSP one-shot gene therapy Casgevy was approved for two blood disorders, sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT), in multiple regions in late 2023/early 2024. Casgevy\u2019s approval has diversified Vertex\u2019s commercial opportunity. Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics\u2019 Casgevy is the first-ever CRISPR/Cas9-based therapy to be approved anywhere in the world. Vertex believes Casgevy has the potential to be a one-time functional cure for SCD and TDT patients, with an estimated patient population of approximately 35,000 across the United States and Europe. Vertex is securing reimbursement and access to Casgevy globally. Casgevy is expected to contribute significantly to revenues from 2025. Vertex\u2019s Upcoming New Products Vertex is preparing for two potential near-term launches \u2014 suzetrigine in acute pain and Alyftrek\u00a0(vanza triple) in CF in 2025 Story Continues Vertex's new drug application (NDA) seeking approval for suzetrigine (formerly known as VX-548) across a broad label in moderate-to-severe acute pain is under review with the FDA. The FDA has granted a priority review to the NDA, with a decision expected on Jan. 30, 2025. Vertex initiated a pivotal phase III program of suzetrigine\u00a0in diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a form of peripheral neuropathic pain caused by damage to nerves, in the third quarter of 2024.\u00a0 Vertex believes suzetrigine has the potential to transform the treatment paradigm of pain, both acute and neuropathic. Pain is an area with limited treatment options, mostly highly addictive opioid-based medications. While Alyftrek was approved in the United States in December, the candidate is under review in the EU and some other countries. Alyftrek is a combination of vanzacaftor, a CFTR potentiator, deutivacaftor, a CFTR corrector and tezacaftor. This new once-a-day oral combination medicine has the potential to offer enhanced patient benefit than Trikafta and become a new standard-of-care treatment in CF. It can potentially treat CF patients who have discontinued Trikafta or other Vertex CF medicines. It can also improve dosing (once daily) and lower the royalty burden. Vertex\u2019s Robust Mid-Stage Pipeline In CF, Vertex is evaluating its medicines in younger patient populations and aims to have small-molecule treatments for most people with the condition. Additionally, Vertex is developing an mRNA therapeutic, VX-522, in partnership with Moderna MRNA for approximately 5,000 people with CF who do not make CFTR protein and who cannot benefit from its CFTR modulators. While Vertex\u2019s main focus is on the development and strengthening of its CF franchise, the company also has a rapidly advancing mid- to late-stage pipeline in other disease areas beyond CF like acute and neuropathic pain, APOL1-mediated kidney diseases (AMKD), alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, IgA nephropathy and cell therapy for type I diabetes. Many of these candidates represent multibillion-dollar opportunities. Several important clinical milestones are expected over the next few months in its CF and non-CF portfolio. Last year\u2019s Alpine acquisition added povetacicept to Vertex\u2019s pipeline, which Vertex believes has a \u201cpipeline in a product\u201d potential. Povetacicept is designed to target two proteins, namely BAFF and APRIL, which are jointly responsible for causing multiple serious autoimmune diseases. A phase III study on povetacicept for the treatment of IgA nephropathy began in the third quarter. Povetacicept is also being evaluated in two phase II basket studies, one in renal diseases and the second in hematologic conditions. Valuation, Estimates and Price In the past year, Vertex\u2019s stock has risen 0.1% against the industry\u2019s 3.4% decrease. VRTX Stock Performance Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The stock is trading at a premium to the industry, as seen in the chart below. VRTX Stock Valuation Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings has declined from $18.61 to $18.26 per share over the past 30 days. VRTX Estimate Movement Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Stay Invested in VRTX\u2019s Stock Declining estimates for 2025, a premium valuation and the recent price drop have made investors wonder if they should sell the stock. The recent pipeline setbacks are also a matter of concern for investors. However, we believe Vertex is a good stock to have in one\u2019s portfolio based on its strong overall financial performance and robust pipeline progress. Vertex faces minimal competition in the CF franchise. CF sales are expected to remain strong despite a slight slowdown in the growth rate. Casgevy and suzetrigine (if approved) will provide the necessary diversification from the CF franchise. The company\u2019s dependence on just the CF franchise for growth was a concern for several analysts but it is gradually resolving it. The new drugs should propel its top line in future quarters. Though VRTX\u2019s stock currently looks expensive, we don\u2019t see any need to sell the stock as the company has growth potential. Those who already own the stock may retain it for some time to see if its CF sales continue to rise and how the Casgevy launch progresses. Vertex presently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

in American Assets Trust (AAT) Stock? Sushmita Sarker Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 4:32 PM 2 min read In This Article: AAT -0.66% Investors in American Assets Trust, Inc. AAT need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Apr 17, 2025 $25 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. What is Implied Volatility? Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy. What do the Analysts Think? Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for American Assets Trust shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, American Assets Trust is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry that ranks in the Top 28% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 54 cents per share to 50 cents in that period. Given the way analysts feel about American Assets Trust right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected. Looking to Trade Options?

Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 3:00 PM 8 min read In This Article: KMDA +0.45% Kamada Ltd. REHOVOT, Israel and HOBOKEN, N.J., Jan. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kamada Ltd. (NASDAQ: KMDA; TASE: KMDA.TA), a global biopharmaceutical company with a portfolio of marketed products indicated for rare and serious conditions and a leader in the specialty plasma-derived field, today announced that it was awarded a contract with an international organization for the supply of KAMRAB\u00ae and VARIZIG\u00ae in Latin America for 2025-2027. Total expected revenue under the three-year contract for both products is estimated to be approximately $25 million. The expected portion for the calendar year 2025 is incorporated into the Company\u2019s recently announced 2025 revenue guidance. \u201cWe are extremely pleased with this significant three-year supply agreement, which we believe validates the global strength of our leading specialty immunoglobulin portfolio and supports our expected multi-year growth outlook,\u201d said Amir London, Kamada\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. \u201cWinning this tender is indicative of the substantial commercial potential of our broad product portfolio in the international markets, beyond the U.S. and Canada, and we intend to continue pursuing additional commercial contracts in key strategic territories.\" KAMRAB and VARIZIG are two proprietary products in the Company\u2019s leading specialty immune globulin portfolio. KAMRAB is indicated for passive, transient post-exposure prevention of rabies infection when given immediately to individuals in cases of contact with rabid or possibly rabid animals. VARIZIG is a Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin (Human) indicated for post-exposure prophylaxis in high-risk individuals. About KAMRAB\u00ae KAMRAB is a human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) indicated for passive, transient post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) of rabies infection to persons of all ages when given immediately after contact with a rabid or possibly rabid animal. KAMRAB should be administered concurrently with a full course of rabies vaccine. Important Safety Information about KAMRAB Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur with KAMRAB. IgA deficient patients with antibodies against IgA are at greater risk. Have epinephrine available immediately to treat any acute severe hypersensitivity reactions. KAMRAB administration may interfere with the development of an immune response to live attenuated virus vaccines. If feasible, delay immunization with the measles vaccine for 4 months, and other live attenuated virus vaccines for three months, after KAMRAB administration. A transient rise of the various passively transferred antibodies in the patient\u2019s blood may result in misleading positive results of serologic tests after KAMRAB administration. Passive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte antigens, e.g., A, B, and D, may interfere with serologic tests for red cell antibodies such as the antiglobulin test (Coombs\u2019 test). KAMRAB is made from human plasma donors and may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses, the variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (vCJD) agent and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent. Story Continues About VARIZG\u00ae VARIZIG [Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin (Human)] is a product that contains antibodies specific for the Varicella zoster virus, and it is indicated for post-exposure prophylaxis of varicella (chickenpox) in high-risk patient groups, including immunocompromised children, newborns, and pregnant women. VARIZIG is intended to reduce the severity of chickenpox infections in these patients. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends VARIZIG for post-exposure prophylaxis of varicella for persons at high-risk for severe disease who lack evidence of immunity to varicella. The product is the sole FDA-approved IgG product for this indication. Important Safety Information about VARIZIG VARIZIG contains trace amounts of IgA. Individuals known to have anaphylactic or severe systemic (hypersensitivity) reactions to human immune globulin preparations should not receive VARIZIG. IgA-deficient patients with antibodies against IgA and a history of hypersensitivity may have an anaphylactoid reaction. Thrombotic events may occur during or following treatment with immune globulin products. Administer VARIZIG intramuscularly only. In patients who have severe thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injections, only administer VARIZIG if the expected benefits outweigh the potential risks. Severe hypersensitivity reactions may occur following VARIZIG administration. In case of hypersensitivity, discontinue the administration of VARIZIG immediately and provide appropriate treatment. Because VARIZIG is made from human plasma, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses, the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease agent, and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease agent. The most serious adverse drug reactions observed in clinical trials for all subjects and patients include pyrexia, nausea, and vomiting. The most common adverse drug reactions observed in clinical trials for all subjects and patients were injection site pain, headache, chills, fatigue, rash, and nausea. About Kamada Kamada Ltd.

Phase 1/2a Study of KRRO-110 for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency and Provides Pipeline Update Korro Bio, Inc. Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 4:00 PM 7 min read In This Article: KRRO -1.82% Korro Bio, Inc. KRRO-110 is the first product candidate from Korro\u2019s proprietary RNA editing OPERA TM platform Interim readout from REWRITE expected in the second half of 2025 Korro to advance additional pipeline programs towards clinical development CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Jan. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Korro Bio, Inc. (Korro) (Nasdaq: KRRO), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a new class of genetic medicines based on editing RNA for both rare and highly prevalent diseases, today announced the initiation of dosing in its REWRITE study investigating KRRO-110 as a potential treatment for individuals with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD). \u201cKRRO-110 is designed to restore therapeutic M-AAT protein levels in individuals with at least one Z allele by leveraging the body\u2019s endogenous ADAR enzyme. The swift initiation of the REWRITE study for AATD is a testament to our collective strength and focused execution at Korro,\u201d said Kemi Olugemo, MD, Chief Medical Officer at Korro. \u201cWe are encouraged by our preclinical data, which demonstrates rapid restoration of functional AAT protein levels and durable editing. Our goal is to create a clinically differentiated, disease-modifying treatment to address both lung and liver manifestations of AATD. We look forward to evaluating the therapeutic potential of KRRO-110 and sharing interim data in the second half of this year.\u201d REWRITE is a two-part single and multiple dose-escalating study that will evaluate the safety and tolerability of KRRO-110 in up to 64 participants, including healthy adults and clinically stable AATD patients with the PiZZ genotype. Secondary and exploratory endpoints include pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters that will guide optimal dose selection for later stage studies. Interim data from Part 1 (single ascending doses in healthy volunteers and individuals with AATD) is expected in the second half of 2025, and completion of the study is anticipated in 2026. For additional information about the REWRITE study, visit ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06677307). In addition to advancing KRRO-110, Korro is progressing a pipeline of wholly owned programs and a Novo Nordisk partnered program in a cardiometabolic indication towards the clinic. \u201cWe have evolved from a research organization to a clinical-stage drug development organization with our first participant in the REWRITE study recently dosed with KRRO-110. We have taken time to build our pipeline to demonstrate the versatility of RNA editing, building on data from other oligonucleotide programs,\u201d said Ram Aiyar, PhD, President and CEO. \u201cOver the next three years, we expect to take three product candidates into the clinic, in two tissue types with a single modular platform. This will be the crux of our 3-2-1 strategy through 2027. I am excited about the prospect that RNA editing holds beyond the treatment of rare genetic disease and applying our platform to highly prevalent diseases.\u201d Story Continues About Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) and KRRO-110 AATD is a genetic disorder most commonly caused by a single missense mutation (G-to-A) in the SERPINA1 gene. Affected adults experience pulmonary emphysema and/or hepatic cirrhosis, as well as end organ manifestations. KRRO-110 is the first RNA editing oligonucleotide product candidate from Korro\u2019s proprietary RNA editing platform, Oligonucleotide Promoted Editing of RNA (OPERA\u2122). KRRO-110 is designed to co-opt an endogenous enzyme, Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA (ADAR), to edit the \u201cA\u201d variant on SERPINA1 RNA, repair an amino acid codon, and restore secretion of normal AAT protein. This repair of the endogenous protein has the potential to clear protein aggregates from within liver cells to create a potentially clinically differentiated benefit for liver function and to preserve lung function by providing an adequate amount of normal AAT protein. About Korro Korro is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a new class of genetic medicines for both rare and highly prevalent diseases using its proprietary RNA editing platform. Korro is generating a portfolio of differentiated programs that are designed to harness the body\u2019s natural RNA editing process, enabling a precise yet transient single base edit. By editing RNA instead of DNA, Korro is expanding the reach of genetic medicines by delivering additional precision and tunability, which has the potential for increased specificity and improved long-term tolerability.
