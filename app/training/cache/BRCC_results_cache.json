[{"text": "Black Rifle Coffee Company Announces Long-Range Financial Targets and Reaffirms 2024 Guidance Business Wire Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 2:00 PM 10 min read In This Article: BRCC -4.80% SALT LAKE CITY, January 14, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Black Rifle Coffee Company (NYSE: BRCC) (\"Black Rifle\" or \"the Company\"), a veteran-founded premium lifestyle brand and coffee company supporting the service community, will present today at the 27th Annual ICR Conference. The presentation will outline the Company\u2019s opportunities for multi-year growth in large and attractive beverage categories, as well as its profitability goals. Investor Day Financial Highlights Growth Outlook : Black Rifle expects a 3-year revenue CAGR through 2027 of 10\u201315% and an adjusted EBITDA CAGR of 15\u201325%, compared to 2024 results. The Company projects a gross margin rate above 40%. With the launch of Black Rifle Energy in 2025, we expect revenue growth to fall below the guided 3-year rate and gross margin to dip below 40% for the year. While these expenses may temporarily impact EBITDA, they are expected to set the stage for stronger growth in 2026 and 2027 as distribution expands and launch-related costs taper off. 2024 Guidance Reaffirmed : The Company reaffirms all components of its 2024 guidance, previously updated on November 4, 2024, including: Net revenue of $390 million\u2013$395 million Gross margin rate between 40\u201342% Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $35 million\u2013$40 million Presentation Details Date and Time : Tuesday, January 14, 2025, at 8:00 AM Eastern Time.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release contains a non-U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") financial measure for Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA, as net income (loss) before interest, tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense as adjusted for equity-based compensation, system implementation costs, executive, recruiting, relocation and sign-on bonus, write-off of site development costs, strategic initiative related costs, non-routine legal expenses, RTD start-up production issues, contract termination costs, restructuring fees and related costs, RTD transformation costs, and impairment for assets held for sale. This non-GAAP financial measure is not defined or calculated under principles, standards or rules that comprise GAAP. Accordingly, the non-GAAP financial measure we use and refer to should not be viewed as a substitute for performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as a substitute for a measure of liquidity. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA is specific to our business and you should not assume that it is comparable to similarly titled financial measures of other companies. To evaluate the performance of our business, we rely on both our results of operations recorded in accordance with GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA. Story Continues When used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance and liquidity because this measure facilitates comparisons of historical performance by excluding non-cash items such as equity-based payments and other amounts not directly attributable to our primary operations, such as the impact of system implementation, acquisitions, disposals, litigation and settlements. Adjusted EBITDA is also a key metric used internally by our management to evaluate performance and develop internal budgets and forecasts. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP and may not provide a complete understanding of our operating results as a whole. Some of these limitations are (i) it does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs, (ii) it does not reflect our interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt, (iii) it does not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes, (iv) it does not reflect historical capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, (v) although equity-based compensation expenses are non-cash charges, we rely on equity compensation to compensate and incentivize employees, directors and certain consultants, and we may continue to do so in the future and (vi) although depreciation, amortization and impairments are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and this non-GAAP measure does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. The guidance provided above constitutes forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. Refer to the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" safe harbor section below for information on the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. We have not reconciled forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income (loss), in reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception provided under Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. We cannot predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain components of such reconciliation, including market-related assumptions that are not within our control, or others that may arise, without unreasonable effort. For these reasons, we are unable to assess the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could materially impact the amount of future net income (loss). FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This press release contains forward-looking statements about the Company and its industry that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this press release, including statements regarding the Company\u2019s intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, the Company\u2019s financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies, future market conditions, developments in the capital and credit markets and expected future financial performance, as well as any information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations, are forward-looking statements.

Risk Factors\" included therein, as well as in our other filings with the SEC. Such forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this press release and the Company\u2019s current beliefs and expectations concerning future developments and their effects on the Company.

Although the Company believes that it has a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this press release, the Company cannot guarantee that the future results, growth, performance or events or circumstances reflected in these forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur at all. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.

(BRCC) One of the Best Coffee Stocks to Buy? Zarah Hamid Thu, Dec 12, 2024, 9:52 AM 5 min read We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Coffee Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where BRC Inc. (NYSE:BRCC) stands against the other best coffee stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The Global Coffee Market Continues to Struggle According to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global coffee market size is estimated at $132.13 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow to $166.39 billion by 2029, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 4.72% during the forecast period. Over the last 2 years, coffee prices have hit multi-year peaks. Reuters reports that global coffee prices have risen to their highest in nearly 50 years. This has been the result of poor weather in Brazil and Vietnam. Brazil produces almost half the world's high-end beans used primarily in roast and ground blends. The country has been the victim of one of its worst droughts on record this year. While rains did come in the month of October, they might have been too late. According to farmers and agronomists, the coffee trees are unable to recover for the 2025 crop. The next crop is not expected to be big. It is believed that coffee trees that have suffered from the dryness would be using energy to produce leaves, instead of fruits, after the rain. This means that there will be barely enough energy in the crops to develop fruits after flowering. The other major coffee producer Vietnam produces roughly 40% of the robusta beans used to make instant coffee. The country was subjected to a severe drought earlier in 2024 which was followed by excess rains since October, with the current harvest following 3 years of supply deficits. How\u2019s the End Market Likely to Suffer? The soaring coffee prices are casting their impact across the value chain as they hurt roasters and cafes and eventually the customers. Consumers are expected to see the price spike in 6 to 12 months since roasters tend to buy coffee months in advance. The Nescafe and Nespresso maker Nestl\u00e9 has decided to raise prices and make bags smaller with beans getting expensive. Especially for the American coffee enthusiast, imported goods such as coffee beans are likely to witness markups if the new administration decides to impose tariffs on coffee-producing countries. Before the potential price hikes from tariffs hit, many Americans are already stockpiling various goods including coffee.

Have Been Trimming Their BRC Inc. (NYSE:BRCC) Price Target After Its Latest Report editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 4:32 PM 3 min read In This Article: BRCC -4.80% Last week saw the newest quarterly earnings release from BRC Inc. ( NYSE:BRCC ), an important milestone in the company's journey to build a stronger business. The business exceeded expectations with revenue of US$98m coming in 3.0% ahead of forecasts. Statutory losses were US$0.01 a share, in line with what the analysts predicted. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year. See our latest analysis for BRC NYSE:BRCC Earnings and Revenue Growth November 7th 2024 Taking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from BRC's six analysts is for revenues of US$430.2m in 2025. This reflects a modest 6.2% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. BRC is also expected to turn profitable, with statutory earnings of US$0.05 per share. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$441.4m and earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.057 in 2025. From this we can that sentiment has definitely become more bearish after the latest results, leading to lower revenue forecasts and a real cut to earnings per share estimates. The consensus price target fell 6.7% to US$5.88, with the weaker earnings outlook clearly leading valuation estimates. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. Currently, the most bullish analyst values BRC at US$11.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$4.00. We would probably assign less value to the analyst forecasts in this situation, because such a wide range of estimates could imply that the future of this business is difficult to value accurately. As a result it might not be a great idea to make decisions based on the consensus price target, which is after all just an average of this wide range of estimates. Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. We would highlight that BRC's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 4.9% annualised growth rate until the end of 2025 being well below the historical 25% p.a. growth over the last five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 2.8% annually. Even after the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that BRC is also expected to grow faster than the wider industry. Story Continues The Bottom Line The biggest concern is that the analysts reduced their earnings per share estimates, suggesting business headwinds could lay ahead for BRC. Regrettably, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, but the latest forecasts still imply the business will grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target fell measurably, with the analysts seemingly not reassured by the latest results, leading to a lower estimate of BRC's future valuation. With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on BRC. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits.
