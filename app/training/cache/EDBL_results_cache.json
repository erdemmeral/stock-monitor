Non-Binding Letter of Intent to Acquire NARAYAN GROUP to Expand into the European and North American Markets Edible Garden AG Incorporated Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 3:15 PM 12 min read In This Article: EDBL -2.44% EDBLW +5.56% Edible Garden AG Incorporated BELVIDERE, NJ, Jan. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Edible Garden AG Incorporated (\u201cEdible Garden\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (Nasdaq: EDBL, EDBLW) , a leader in controlled environment agriculture (CEA), locally grown, organic, and sustainable produce and products, today announced the signing of a non-binding letter of intent (LOI) to purchase the outstanding share capital of Narayan d.o.o. and its subsidiaries (\u201cNarayan Group\u201d), a prominent producer of organic coconut and superfood products. The Narayan Group, headquartered in Slovenia, brings established products characterized by consistent revenue growth and EBITDA 1 with significant market reach that has achieved over $22 Million in revenue 2 during the first nine months of 2024. Narayan expects fourth quarter revenue in excess of $9.5 Million, which would result in expected annual revenue of approximately $31.5 Million for the year ending December 31, 2024. 3 With Narayan\u2019s vertically integrated supply chain and leadership in the European market combining with Edible Garden\u2019s innovative CEA technology and product placement within their North American distribution network on a combined basis, the Narayan Group and Edible Garden expect to achieve combined revenues in excess of $60 Million in 2025. 4 The Narayan Group has demonstrated consistent positive EBITDA 1 , with net sales revenue growing steadily from $12.1 Million in 2020 to $26.9 Million in 2023. The Narayan Group generated net income of $0.9 Million and EBITDA 1 of $3.0 Million in 2023 and is expected to report increased revenues and EBITDA 1 for fiscal 2024. Mario Brumat, CEO of Narayan Group, stated, \u201cWe believe this strategic transaction with Edible Garden represents a transformative opportunity to combine Narayan\u2019s high-growth business model and strong European market leadership with Edible Garden\u2019s innovative CEA technology and established distribution channels in North America. Together, we expect to be able to accelerate market expansion, particularly in the U.S. and Canada, by delivering products that meet rising consumer demand for organic and sustainable food products. We anticipate this collaboration will drive operational efficiencies, and provide cross selling opportunities of our combined product lines throughout North America and Europe which should provide immediate short-term and sustainable long-term shareholder value through scalable growth and increased market share in the growing market sector we are addressing.\u201d Jim Kras, CEO of Edible Garden, added, \u201cWe believe Narayan Group\u2019s proven success and alignment with our Zero-Waste Inspired \u00ae vision will allow us to build scale, expand internationally, and enhance our operational efficiency. This value acquisition should position us to create meaningful value for our shareholders by meeting the growing demand for sustainable, plant-based food products. Narayan has a demonstrated strength in acquiring and developing products under a vertically integrated supply chain management strategy resulting in strong gross margins throughout Europe. We believe this transaction will provide us with immediate value, allow us to introduce Narayan\u2019s products into the North American market and provide a much stronger base to grow in the future. Our combined strategy will be to build on Narayan\u2019s footprint in Europe with their ability to acquire other successful product offerings and to expand those through our established and growing North American channels.\u201d Story Continues The Proposed Transaction Under the terms of the LOI, in consideration for 100% of the share capital of Narayan d.o.o. (the parent of the Narayan Group companies), Edible Garden will issue to the Narayan shareholders shares of Edible Garden common stock. Subject to completion of the respective parties\u2019 due diligence investigation and receipt by Edible Garden of an opinion from an independent investment banker that the terms of the transaction are fair to the Edible Garden stockholders from a financial point of view, it is anticipated that a majority of the fully-diluted outstanding shares of Edible Garden common stock at closing will be issued to the Narayan shareholders. The LOI contemplates that, subject to Nasdaq requirements, a majority of the members of the Edible Garden board of directors shall be designated by the Narayan shareholders or their affiliate. Jim Kras will continue to serve as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Edible and Mario Brumat, the current president of Narayan will continue to head European operations and serve as a member of the Edible Garden board of directors. Closing of the transaction is expected to be subject to a number of closing conditions, including a satisfactory due diligence investigation by both parties, completion of a \u20ac6.0 million equity financing for Narayan, consummation of a contemplated reverse stock split of the current outstanding shares of common stock of Edible Garden, execution of employment agreements for Messrs. Kras and Brumat, establishment of a 2025 Equity Incentive Plan for Edible and approval of the transaction by the Edible Garden stockholders.

pulses supplier The Narayan Group A bowl of quinoa \u00b7 Just Food \u00b7 Max Griss / Unsplash Dean Best Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 5:19 PM 2 min read In This Article: EDBLW +5.56% US-listed fresh-produce supplier Edible Garden is looking to buy The Narayan Group, a European supplier of oils and pulses. Edible Garden said it had signed a non-binding letter of intent to \u201cpurchase the outstanding share capital\u201d of Narayan. Slovenia-based Narayan supplies organic coconut products and a range of spices, pulses and grains. It sells into major European retailers including Aldi and Lidl. Edible Garden, which is listed on the Nasdaq, specialises in controlled environment agriculture and sells into stores in the US, Caribbean and South America. The company operates vertically-integrated greenhouses and processing facilities in New Jersey and Michigan. It also markets condiments and pickles. Jim Kras, Edible Garden\u2019s CEO, said: \u201cThis value acquisition should position us to create meaningful value for our shareholders by meeting the growing demand for sustainable, plant-based food products. We believe this transaction will provide us with immediate value, allow us to introduce Narayan\u2019s products into the North American market and provide a much stronger base to grow in the future. \"Our combined strategy will be to build on Narayan\u2019s footprint in Europe with their ability to acquire other successful product offerings and to expand those through our established and growing North American channels.\u201d Under the terms of the proposed deal, Edible Garden will issue shares in its business to Narayan\u2019s investors. Subject to the completion of due diligence by both companies, the businesses expect a majority of the fully-diluted outstanding shares of Edible Garden common stock at closing will be issued to the Narayan shareholders. The letter of intent also sets out that, subject to Nasdaq requirements, a majority of the members of the Edible Garden board of directors shall be designated by the Narayan shareholders or their affiliate. Kras will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Edible Garden. Mario Brumat, Narayan\u2019s president, will head the combined group\u2019s European operations and become a member of the Edible Garden board of directors. Brumat said: \u201cWe believe this strategic transaction with Edible Garden represents a transformative opportunity to combine Narayan\u2019s high-growth business model and strong European market leadership with Edible Garden\u2019s innovative CEA technology and established distribution channels in North America. \"Together, we expect to be able to accelerate market expansion, particularly in the US and Canada, by delivering products that meet rising consumer demand for organic and sustainable food products.\u201d Story Continues \"Edible Garden eyes deal with oils and pulses supplier The Narayan Group\" was originally created and published by Just Food , a GlobalData owned brand.

Incorporated Wed, Nov 13, 2024, 3:00 PM 11 min read In This Article: EDBL -2.44% EDBLW +5.56% Edible Garden AG Incorporated Healthy Core Business Operations - Year-to-Date Cut Herbs Sales Up 55% and Pulp Sales Up; Momentum Expected to Continue into 2025 Conference Call to Be Held Today at 8:00 am ET BELVIDERE, N.J., Nov. 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Edible Garden AG Incorporated (\u201cEdible Garden\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (Nasdaq: EDBL), a leader in controlled environment agriculture (CEA), locally grown, organic and sustainable produce and products, today provided a business update and reported financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Jim Kras, Chief Executive Officer of Edible Garden, commented, \" We are pleased to report another strong quarter. Earlier this year, we made a strategic shift away from lower margin floral and lettuce products. This decision continues to pay dividends, highlighted by a $687,000 increase in gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year, representing gross profit margin expansion of 27% as compared to the third quarter of 2023. This remarkable improvement reflects the consistent margin growth that has fueled our progress in recent quarters, while marginally impacting our revenue growth in the second and third quarters. Furthermore, our gross profit for the first nine months of 2024 surged by $1.7 million\u2014an impressive 324% increase over the prior year.\u201d \u201cOur core business is stronger than ever, as demonstrated by a 55% increase in sales of cut herbs for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023. Revenue for the first nine months ended September 30, 2024, showed a slight year-over-year increase. Third-quarter revenue for 2024 was down from the same period last year, driven by our strategic decision to phase out lower-margin products and categories. For example, in connection with phasing out our legacy floral business at our Edible Garden Heartland facility in Grand Rapids, Michigan, we have installed a new production line to expand our capacity to drive the growth of our higher margin products. We believe these initiatives will help us accelerate achieving our goal of sustainable cash flow and profitability.\u201d \u201cWe also strengthened our balance sheet through our September S1 offering, raising approximately $5.65 million in gross proceeds. We allocated a portion of these funds to pay down $3.2 million in debt due in 2025, helping to deleverage our business and advance our goal of achieving positive free cash flow. Additionally, we invested in working capital ahead of the fourth-quarter holiday season, positioning us to better meet customer demand.\u201d Story Continues \"Our partnership with Walmart continues to grow in meaningful ways, including the introduction of our sustainably grown Hydro Basil, showcased through a custom-designed Basil Station display that integrates seamlessly into Walmart\u2019s produce sections without disrupting existing planograms. Additionally, we have launched Edible Garden\u2019s Vitamin Whey line of whey and plant protein powders, under the Vitamin Whey\u00ae and Vitamin Way\u00ae brands, on Walmart Marketplace. This move not only broadens consumer access to our Vitamin Whey products but also paves the way for expanding our offerings on Walmart\u2019s platform, with plans to include our shelf-stable Pulp line of gourmet, sustainable sauces, and chili-based products, along with other shelf-stable items currently in development. The growth potential on Walmart Marketplace is tremendous, and we are confident our innovative products will resonate with the evolving tastes of a widening consumer base. We believe that this deepening collaboration with Walmart will boost Edible Garden\u2019s revenue growth in 2024 and beyond.\" \"Our Pulp Flavors line of USDA organic, fermented and sustainable line of gourmet sauces experienced sales growth in the third quarter of 2024 as we continue to add to our existing distribution network which includes prominent retailers such as Target, Whole Foods, Meijer, Morton Williams, Dierbergs Markets, Woodman\u2019s, and distributors like KeHE and UNFI. With the global sauces and condiments market projected by Research and Markets to grow from $172.79 billion in 2021 to $240.7 billion by 2028, we believe Pulp is well positioned to satisfy consumers\u2019 appetite for bold, unique flavors that elevate meals from 'Bland to Bold\u00ae.\u2019\u201d \"We also introduced our innovative Kick Sports Nutrition line, offering premium performance products tailored for today\u2019s health-conscious athletes. Kick. is designed to meet the evolving priorities of athletes who are increasingly mindful of their nutritional intake. According to IMARC Group, the global sports nutrition market is projected to grow from $54.8 billion in 2023 to $103.3 billion by 2032, fueled by health-conscious consumers who seek personalized, clean-label products that enhance athletic performance, align with dietary preferences, prioritize natural ingredients, and offer convenient, on-the-go solutions.\" \u201cThe Company also received grants from the USDA Organic Certification Program, providing key support to offset organic certification and processing costs at our facilities in Belvidere, NJ, and Grand Rapids, MI. These funds will also fuel R&D for new organic product innovations, aligning with our Zero-Waste Inspired\u00ae mission. This partnership with the USDA strengthens our commitment to sustainable, local, and organic agriculture, reinforcing our role as a leader in controlled environment farming and our dedication to positively impacting the industry and the communities we serve.\u201d \u201cWe believe we have streamlined our business, eliminating elements that previously limited gross margin and revenue growth and that our core business operations are healthy and performing well. Given the current trends that we are seeing, we feel confident that the fourth quarter of 2024 will deliver significant growth in both margins and revenue, potentially marking one of the strongest quarters in the Company\u2019s history. With a solid foundation and infrastructure in place, we believe we are poised not only to achieve strong results in the coming quarters but also to drive sustained growth and long-term value for our shareholders,\u201d concluded Mr. Kras. Financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue totaled $2.6 million, compared to $3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by our strategic shift away from the sale of lower margin products; specifically, lettuce and floral. The absence of these two products accounted for a decrease of $597,000 in revenue and certain shipments of our nutraceutical products were delayed due to a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico, which caused $215,000 of revenue to shift to the fourth quarter. Cost of goods sold totaled $1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by our seasonally low sales in the current quarter and the elimination of the use of large third-party growers that previously made up a material portion of our cost of goods sold. Selling, general and administrative (\u201cSG&A\u201d) expenses were $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in labor costs and professional fees. Net loss was $2.1 million, or ($0.65) per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $2.4 million, or ($13.83) per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The improvement in net loss was primarily driven by a 27% expansion of gross profit margin and lower SG&A offset by other expenses. The complete financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2024, are available in the Company\u2019s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available at: www.sec.gov.

Positive Points Edible Garden AG Inc ( NASDAQ:EDBL ) reported a significant increase in gross profit for Q3 2024, with a $687,000 rise compared to the same period last year. The company's gross profit margin improved significantly, reaching 27.1% in Q3 2024, reflecting consistent margin growth. Sales of cut herbs increased by 55% for the first nine months of 2024, indicating strong demand for core products. The company strengthened its balance sheet by raising approximately $5.65 million in gross proceeds from a September S1 offering, which helped reduce debt. Edible Garden AG Inc ( NASDAQ:EDBL ) expanded its partnership with Walmart, launching new products like Hydro Basil and Vitamin Way protein powders, enhancing product accessibility and potential revenue growth. Negative Points Q3 2024 revenue decreased to $2.6 million from $3 million in the same period last year, primarily due to phasing out lower margin products. The strategic decision to eliminate the lettuce and floral categories resulted in a $597,000 decrease in revenue. Weather events, specifically Hurricane Helene, impacted nutraceutical product sales, shifting $215,000 of revenue from Q3 to Q4. Despite improvements, the company reported a net loss of $2.1 million for Q3 2024, although this was an improvement from the previous year's loss. The transition away from contract growers and lower margin products may pose challenges in meeting demand during peak seasons without relying on external resources. Q & A Highlights Q : With the reduction in contract growers, can Edible Garden handle the demand this busy season without them? A : Jim Kras, CEO, confirmed that they do not need contract growers to meet demand. The company has focused on infrastructure and gross profit improvement, adding more capacity with new production lines. This positions them to handle current and increased demand, potentially making Q4 their best quarter ever. Story Continues Q : Can you quantify the impact of the hurricanes in Florida on revenue? A : Jim Kras stated that approximately $215,000 in revenue was shifted from Q3 to Q4 due to hurricane-related port closures affecting their Nutrisa line for a major client, PriceSmart. Q : What growth can be expected from the sports nutrition line in 2025? A : Jim Kras expressed optimism about significant growth, citing commitments for the KIC sports nutrition line. They plan to launch with major retailers and Amazon, leveraging his extensive experience in the category. Q : Is the gross margin improvement from exiting low-margin products fully reflected in Q3, or is there more potential? A : Jim Kras indicated that gross profit margins should continue to expand as they focus on core business and efficiencies. They have exited low-margin products like certain lettuces and florals, which were not core to their business. Q : What are the expectations for Q4 2024 and beyond? A : Jim Kras concluded that they expect significant growth in both margin and revenue in Q4 2024, potentially marking it as one of the strongest quarters in the company's history. They are well-positioned for sustained growth and long-term shareholder value. For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .

Having said that I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Kras, Chief Executive Officer of Edible Garden. Jim? Jim Kras Thanks Ted, good morning and thank you to everyone for joining us today. We are pleased to report another strong quarter highlighted by an increase of $687,000 in gross profit for Q3 2024 compared to the same period last year, our gross profit margin experienced significant growth reaching 27.1% this quarter. This significant improvement reflects the consistent margin growth that has fueled our progress in recent quarters while marginally impacting our revenue growth in the 2nd and 3rd quarters. Furthermore, our gross profit for the first nine months of 2024 surged by $1.7 million. An impressive 324% increase over prior year. Our core business and fundamentals are stronger than ever as demonstrated by a 55% increase in sales of cut herbs for the first nine months of 2024. Compared to 2023 revenue for the first nine months ended September 30th, 2024, showed a slight year over year increase. Third quarter revenue for 2024 was down from the same period last year driven by a strategic decision to phase out of lower margin products and categories. For example, in connection with phasing out our legacy floral business at the at the Edible Garden Heartland facility in Grand Rapids. We have installed new production lines to expand our capacity to drive the growth of our higher margin products. We believe these initiatives will help accelerate achieving our goal of sustainable cash flow and profitability. We also strengthened our balance sheet with our September S1 offering raising approximately $5.65 million in gross proceeds. Part of these funds went went towards paying down $3.2 million in debt due 2025 helping to reduce our leverage and move us closer to achieving positive free cash flow. Additionally, we invested in working capital ahead of the fourth quarter holiday season, putting us in a strong position to meet customer demand and peak season sales. Our partnership with Walmart continues to evolve in meaningful ways including the debut of our sustainably grown Hydro Basil featured in a custom designed Basil station that fits seamlessly into Walmart's produce section without disrupting current planograms. Additionally, we launched Edible Gardens Vitamin Way lines of whey and plant-based protein powders on Walmart marketplace. This not only enhances accessibility for our Vitamin Way products but also lays the groundwork to expand our offerings on the platform with new products. We are confident our innovative products will resonate with the evolving taste of an expanded consumer audience. We believe this deepening collaboration with Walmart positions, edible garden revenue growth in 2024 and beyond. For our Pepper Flavor line of USDA Organic Fermented and sustainable line of gourmet sauces experienced sales growth in the third quarter of 2024 as we continue to add to our existing distribution network, which includes prominent retailers such as Target Whole Foods, Meyer M Williams, dear BGS Woodman's and distributors like KeHE and UNFI and more. According to research and markets, the global sauces and condiments market is projected to grow from 173 billion in 2021 to 240 billion in 2028. And pulp is poised to meet the rising demand for bold unique flavors that take meals from bland of bulk. We also introduced our innovative kick sports nutrition line, a premium range, a range of performance products designed for today's health conscious athletes. KIC addresses the evolving needs of athletes who prioritize the quality impact of their nutritional intake. According to IMA Group, the sports nutrition market is expected to grow from $55 billion in 2023 to 103 billion by 2032. Fueled by an increasing demand for clean labels, personalized products that enhance performance, cater dietary preferences and offer convenient on the go options. With over 25 years of experience in sports nutrition and a track record of successful brand launches like body fortress, pure protein and matrix. I'm confident that K sports nutrition is more than just a new product line. It's going to set a standard in the industry. Our vision to redefine the category by delivering innovative purpose driven solutions that are better for you that truly address the evolving needs of athletes is more important than ever. Edible Garden also receives grants from the USDA organic Certification program, providing financial key support to help offset the cost of organic certification, processing and handling and certifications. These funds will not only reduce expenses associated with maintaining our organic certification at our belvedere, New Jersey and Grand Rapids facilities but also support research and development for new product innovation. As leaders in controlled environment agriculture, we are deeply committed to producing local organic and sustainable products, making organic certification a valuable asset for the business. These grants further strengthen our partnership with the USDA and align seamlessly with the company's zero waste. Inspired mission by utilizing these funds to drive R&D for new or new organic offerings. We look forward to exploring new opportunities to work together and to continue to lead the way in sustainable agriculture ensuring that we make a lasting positive contribution to the industry and the communities we serve. I would now like to turn the call over to Kostas Dafoulas, Our Interim Chief Financial Officer who will review the financial results for the three months ended, September 30th, 2024, Kostas? Story Continues Kostas Dafoulas Thanks Jim and good morning, everyone turning to our third quarter results revenue totaled 2.6 million compared to $3 million for the three months ended September 30th, 2023, The decrease was primarily driven by our strategic shift away from the sale of lower margin products and impact from weather events. Specifically, our strategic decision to eliminate the lettuce and floral categories accounted for a decrease of 597,000 in revenue. The impact of hurricane Helene on our nutraceutical products resulted in the shift of $215,000 of revenue from the third to the fourth quarter. Cost of goods sold totaled $1.9 million for the three months ended September 30th, 2024, compared to $3.3 million for the three months ended September 30th, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by our seasonally low sales in the current quarter as well as the elimination of the use of large third party growers that previously made up a material portion of our cost of goods sold. We saw continued strength in our gross profit margin as a result of this strategic decision move away from low margin categories. We delivered gross profit margin for Q3 2024 of 27%. Our second straight quarter positive double digit margin selling general and administrative expenses were $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30th, 2024, compared to $2.4 million for the three months ended September 30th, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in labor costs and professional fees. As we continue to find efficiencies in our cost structure. Net loss was $2.1 million or $0.65 per share for the three months ended September 30th, 2024, compared to a net loss of $2.4 million or $13.83 per share for the three months ended September 30th, 2023. Improvement in net loss was primarily driven by the gross profit margin expansion and lower SG and a offset by other expenses in closing. We are proud of the hard work. Our team has put into improving our growth margin and the strong execution we experienced this quarter. The Q3 results demonstrate that our strategic shift in product mix and reduce reliance on third party growers is paying off and we remain committed to a disciplined financial approach with that operator. Please open the line for questions. Question and Answer Session Operator Thank you very much. At this time, we will be conducting our question and answer session.

If you would like to remove your question from the queue for any participants using speaker equipment, it might be necessary to pick up your handset before you press the keys. Please wait a moment whilst we poll for questions. Thank you very much. Your first question is coming from Anthony Vendetti of the Maxim Group. Anthony your line of life. Anthony Vendetti Thank you. Good morning. So let me you, you've reduced significantly contract growers which obviously, you know, improve your gross margin significantly. So, We're glad to see that. But as you move into this quarter that we're in right now, this is your busy season. Are are you able to handle the demand this season? With fewer contract growers than last season or do you have to rely on them to meet the demand? Jim Kras So, hey, Anthony, good morning. So the answer is we don't need the contract growers to service our demand. And look, we focused on infrastructure GP improvement and the fundamentals of the business in the last two quarters. And it shows in, you know, sequential quarter to quarter, you know, GP improvement and dramatic improvement at that. That's a result of bringing a vertically integrating the facilities and adding more capacity. So, you know, we did, you know, this was, I believe in the press release and in my opening script, we put in, you know, another production line state of the art made the investment there in Grand Rapids. You know, I think what you see now is that, you know, a strong signal to our retail partners that not only can we handle what we currently have, we can take on a lot more and we can push out a lot more in the way of units. So our capacity is only sort of, you know, is only limited by our ability to process and putting in, you know, more and more lines as we continue to grow the business. And right now, you know, we've got significant capacity Q4 is shaping up to be potentially our best quarter ever as a function of having that ability to do so. And now the platform is set, the fundamentals have, you know, are set and you know, we can take on, you know, more herbs, more new pro more new products, even more warehousing and cross stocking that once again, add to that top line. So, you know, by trying to move out of these other products that are, you know, that were sort of, you know, legacy products that just really didn't give us what we needed from a, from a GP standpoint, we now can focus and build that core business. So we're ready to run and, and, and we're pretty excited about it and, you know, it was a lot of hard work, excuse me this past quarter to get into a position in order to, you know, get set for you know, for the volume that's coming. Anthony Vendetti Okay, great. And then can, can you just further quantify the impact from the hurricanes in Florida, how much of that revenue in total has moved from the third quarter to the fourth quarter? Jim Kras Well, it was 215000 approximately, that was driven by a relationship that we have with a major big box price smart. We supply a Nutrisa line for them. That business has been growing, considered over the last six months as they've been, you know, watching what we're doing and I've had a relationship with them for decades. So they understand the investment we're making in that segment of the business. And so they out of the port of Miami. So, unfortunately, we had a hurricane at the end of the quarter and they closed the ports while people were evacuating and they weren't bringing in any trucking. So once again, you know, you know, you know, 200,000 plus that gets pushed into the, the Q4 that we didn't benefit from. So, and you know, in the Q4, you know, there's obviously additionally or additional orders that are, you know, keyed up and that will ship by the end of the year as well on top of that, you know, 200 for price mark. So that's kind of unfortunately impacted it, you know, trust me, I wanted the trucks to roll and you know, I can't control weather. Anthony Vendetti Sure, of course. So as we look to 2025 what, what kind of growth can we expect from the sports nutrition line? Jim Kras Well, you know, as I had mentioned, you know, earlier, look, this is a great category. I grew up in the category I worked at, you know, at some big businesses, you know, Nations Bound being one of them, where I ran that part of the business for them and relaunched metric developed from concept Body Fortress, which is a, you know, $150 million line and, and also relaunched pure protein, which is probably another $100 million line. So, you know, point being and they're still around 15 years later, you know, the trends are towards better for you. We have the right formulas. We have a fantastic partner Neutra com that we're just continuing to deepen our relationship with. They were the originators of what are some of the, some of the products like the metrics white box which, you know, started the industry 2,530 years ago. With that said, you know, we're already looking at commitments for KIC and we haven't even gone to full scale production. You know, we're driving a partnership with Amazon to look to potentially coincide the launch with them. It was just with them last week. And so for us, we're expecting some significant growth. Obviously, you know, we're going to have to make product and a lot of that you'll see rolling out towards the tail end of Q1. You think you'll see a launch at a major big box that we have a, we have a deep relationship with, on traditional retail and like I said, I think it will coincide with, with Amazon on that and then roll out with the likes of price Mart internationally. So I couldn't be more excited about it. Like I said, you know, I think putting behind us fixing the core business, you know, and you know, getting the, the greenhouses where they can, they can operate and operate like manufacturing we're there. So now we can start focusing on a lot of these new products. We've got a line of past herbs that we're launching, in Q1 as well. So, you know, next year, you know, I'm pushing my sales team to say, look, let's you know, let's start looking at not only Q1 and with these launches, but what are we doing to drive the business, you know, second half of next year and so I couldn't be more excited about where we are. I feel like it's been a pretty hard, real, pretty tough journey to get here. But, you know, we solved a lot of problems that, you know, our others couldn't, you know, we were watching a lot of our competition on the a side sort of, you know, crap out and, you know, we're positioned for more and you know, the calls have been coming in on the all the businesses to, you know, to ship. And so I, like I said it's been tough but I'm excited. I mean, it truly is. I mean, so I hope that that answers that question, but I'm sorry, go ahead. Anthony Vendetti Yeah, last question on the gross margin side. It sounds like you, you know, particularly lettuce, but maybe there was other low margin products you, you've exited, was that leverage from, from exiting the low margin products such as lettuce fully reflected in the third quarter or is there additional leverage or ability to increase the gross margin from, from the level that you're at? Jim Kras Well, I think, look, I did that mean for us, you know, it's all about, you know, improving our margins and the efficiencies that we're driving currently across the whole supply chain leveraging, you know, every tool that we have in the toolbox is coming down to bear. And so to answer your question is, you know, you should see that gross profit continue to expand as we get, you know, stronger and yeah, I mean, between, you know, look, we're not fully out of the lettuce business, we're just not in the low or no margin lettuce business that we sort of have the service some of the customers when we first started the business, you know, the floral business for us. Look, it's an interesting business but it's just not our core business and, you know, by just, you know, kind of pushing that aside and, and kind of eliminating it and focusing on the food business, which is what we're in. Once again, you know, nothing against florals and flowers, you know, I like them. But, you know, at the end of the day, that's really wasn't our core business. We adhered to our commitment to the distributors that we took on when we bought the facility in Grand Rapids and, you know, we executed well and everybody moved on and I'm sure if I wanted to do floor on the road, I can always pick up the phone and call them, but not our core business. It was a drag. I don't like the competing crops in the greenhouse for a multitude of reasons. Now, we've cleared the deck. I got super capacity place. Looks gorgeous. I just had Myer down there shooting it the other day for social media. You know, we're ready to run. And I don't have to worry about that, that business anymore and it, you know, impacted the margin because it was just labor intensive for what it was and moving pots and it was just an old business that, you know, has never really been sort of automated and it's seasonal and it's just not what we wanted to do and what I want to do. It's all about core business, fundamentals, new products, leveraging a $5000 an hour and to put more of the trucks that are running on produce, getting more on those trucks, improving the logistics. And like I said, you see it where we are right now and we just got started in the last, you know, quarter or two. I mean, and frankly, you know, we've been able to get some real strong players to come in and help us really you know, refine, refine this so I couldn't be more excited about it. Anthony Vendetti Excellent. Alright. Thanks for all that call, Jim. I'll hop back in. Jim Kras I appreciate it. Alright. Thank you, Anthony. Take care. Operator Thank you very much. Just a reminder that if anyone has any questions, you can join the key by pressing star one on your phone keypad. Now don't appear to have anyone else waiting for questions. Just hang on a second in case someone else does jump in. Okay. I don't think we have any further questions. I will now hand back over to the management team for closing comments. Jim Kras Well, thank you for joining us today. We believe we have successfully streamlined our business removing elements that previously constrained revenue growth, core operations and fundamentals are now healthy and performing well based on current trends. We are confident that the fourth quarter of 2024 will display significant growth in both margin and revenue potentially making marking one of the strongest quarters in our company's history with a solid foundation, a robust infrastructure in place. We are well positioned not only to achieve strong results in the coming quarters but to also drive sustained growth and long term value for our shareholders. Operator Thank you very much. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation. Thank you.
