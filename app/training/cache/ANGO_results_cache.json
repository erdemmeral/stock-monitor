Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in AngioDynamics. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does.

This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see AngioDynamics' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing.

in JSCAI Business Wire Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 4:00 PM 7 min read In This Article: ANGO -3.24% Peer-reviewed data highlights successful clinical study with 35.5% clot burden reduction, validating the safety, efficacy, and efficiency of AlphaVac F18 85 System in pulmonary embolism treatment. LATHAM, N.Y., January 13, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--AngioDynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: ANGO), a leading and transformative medical technology company focused on restoring healthy blood flow in the body\u2019s vascular system, expanding cancer treatment options and improving patient quality of life, today announced the publication of the results from the Acute Pulmonary Embolism Extraction Trial with the AlphaVac System (APEX-AV) in the Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (JSCAI). The article, \"Novel Mechanical Aspiration Thrombectomy in Patients with Acute Pulmonary Embolism: Results from the Prospective APEX-AV Trial,\" was published December 27, 2024. Pulmonary embolism (PE), a potentially life-threatening condition, affects approximately 900,000 individuals annually in the United States, with 10-30% of cases resulting in death within one month of diagnosis, according to the American Lung Association. 1 The primary efficacy endpoint of the APEX-AV trial was the reduction in RV/LV ratio between baseline and 48 hours post-procedure. The primary safety endpoint was the rate of MAEs, including events such as major bleeding and serious device-related clinical deterioration, pulmonary vascular injury, and cardiac injury within the first 48 hours. Patients were followed for 30 days post-index procedure. The results demonstrated the device as a safe and effective treatment for acute intermediate-risk PE with a significant reduction in RV/LV ratio and clot burden with a low rate of adverse events. The APEX-AV trial demonstrated a 35.5% reduction in clot burden (via the Modified Miller index score), comparing favorably to other mechanical aspiration devices on the market. 2 The unique design features of the device, including its funnel tip, optional wireless navigation, and blood loss mitigation, contributed to clinically significant improvements in both safety and efficacy. \"Achieving publication in a respected, peer-reviewed journal underscores the strength and importance of the APEX-AV trial findings and their potential impact on patient outcomes,\" said Juan Carlos Serna, AngioDynamics Senior Vice President of Scientific and Clinical Affairs. \"The inclusion of the AlphaVac F18 85 System in JSCAI validates our commitment to advancing meaningful solutions for pulmonary embolism, a life-threatening condition affecting hundreds of thousands of people each year. This milestone caps a transformative year for the AlphaVac F18 85 System, following its FDA clearance for PE thrombectomy and its spotlight at the SCAI Scientific Sessions. We are proud to deliver innovations that equip physicians with effective tools to improve care and save lives.\" Story Continues The APEX-AV trial was initiated in partnership with the widely respected Pulmonary Embolism Response Team (PERT) Consortium\u2122 and was led by co-Principal Investigators William Brent Keeling, MD, Associate Professor at the Emory School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia, and Mona Ranade, MD, Assistant Professor, Interventional Radiology, at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. The trial results were initially presented at The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (SCAI) 2024 Scientific Sessions hosted in Long Beach, California in May. \"We are incredibly excited by the results of the APEX-AV trial, which demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the AlphaVac F18 85 System in treating patients with pulmonary embolism,\" said William Brent Keeling, MD, Associate Professor of Surgery, Department of Surgery, at the Emory University School of Medicine, and Immediate Past President, The PERT Consortium\u2122. \"These outcomes are critical for PE patients, where timely and efficient intervention can greatly improve long-term health outcomes and reduce the risk of complications.\" In December 2023, AngioDynamics announced the completion of patient enrollment in its APEX-AV trial, a single-arm Investigational Device Exemption study that enrolled 122 patients with confirmed acute, intermediate-risk PE across 25 hospital-based sites in the United States to assess the AlphaVac F18\u2078\u2075 System for the treatment of PE. In April 2024, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared the AlphaVac F18 85 System for the treatment of PE. \"The results from the APEX-AV trial demonstrate the significant impact of the AlphaVac F18 85 technology in treating pulmonary embolism,\" said Mona Ranade, MD, Assistant Professor, Interventional Radiology, at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. \"We observed a significant reduction in clot burden pre- and post-treatment, and saw a notable improvement in pulmonary artery pressures, underscoring the efficacy of this innovative approach. The procedure was completed with remarkable efficiency, with a short procedure time, making it a promising option for patients in need of rapid and effective intervention.\" The published article concluded that \"Percutaneous mechanical aspiration thrombectomy with the AlphaVac system provided a safe and effective treatment for acute intermediate-risk PE with a significant reduction in RV/LV ratio and clot burden with a low rate of adverse events.\" JSCAI publishes original research, comprehensive reviews, meta-analyses, study designs, society guidelines, editorials, research letters, case reports, and images.

This figure compares to our fiscal second-quarter Med Tech business\u2019 net sales projection of $25.6 million. On a pro forma basis, Med Tech revenues also totaled $31.6 million, up 25%. This figure compares to our fiscal second-quarter Med Tech business\u2019 net sales projection of $25.6 million. Story Continues The rise was primarily on the back of increased net sales of Auryon amounting to $13.7 million (up 21.8% year over year), AngioVac sales of $8.1 million (up 50.7% year over year), AlphaVac sales of $2.5 million (up 33.3% year over year) and NanoKnife disposable sales of $5 million (up 23.1% year over year).

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise AngioDynamics, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | AngioDynamics, Inc. Quote AngioDynamics\u2019 Margin Analysis In the quarter under review, AngioDynamics\u2019 pro forma gross profit rose 8.9% to $39.9 million. However, the pro forma gross margin contracted 15 basis points to 54.7%. We had projected 51.6% of pro forma gross margin for second-quarter fiscal 2025. Sales and marketing expenses on a pro forma basis increased 6.6% to $25.6 million year over year. Research and development expenses on a pro forma basis decreased 22.8% year over year to $6.4 million, whereas general and administrative expenses on a pro forma basis increased 12.8% to $10.4 million. On a pro forma basis, adjusted operating expenses of $42.4 million increased 2.1% year over year. The adjusted operating loss on a pro forma basis totaled $2.5 million compared with the prior-year quarter\u2019s loss of $4.9 million. ANGO\u2019s Cash Position AngioDynamics exited second-quarter fiscal 2025 with cash and cash equivalents of $54.1 million compared with $55 million at the fiscal first-quarter-end. The company ended the quarter with no debt on its balance sheet. Cumulative net cash used in operating activities was $15.8 million compared with $20.6 million a year ago. AngioDynamics\u2019 FY25 Guidance AngioDynamics has revised its guidance for fiscal 2025. The company continues to expect its net sales in the range of $282 million-$288 million, representing growth of 4.2-6.4% from the comparable fiscal 2024 period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $284.1 million. AngioDynamics now expects its Med Tech revenue growth in the range of 12-15%, up from the earlier growth projection of 10-12% a year ago. Med Device revenue growth is now projected to be flat against growth of 1-3% over the comparable fiscal 2024 period. The adjusted loss per share is now projected to be between 34 cents and 38 cents, narrower than the earlier projection of an adjusted loss of 38 cents to 42 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at a loss of 41 cents per share. Our Take AngioDynamics exited the second quarter of fiscal 2025 with dismal bottom-line results. It registered a loss per share both on a reported and pro-forma basis in the quarter, which is disappointing. The company\u2019s total revenues and U.S. net revenues were down on a reported basis, while International revenues were down on a reported and pro-forma basis and at CER in the quarter. Med Device revenues also declined during the quarter both on a reported and pro-forma basis. The pro-forma gross margin contraction does not bode well. However, AngioDynamics\u2019 narrower-than-expected adjusted loss per share and better-than-expected revenues in the fiscal second quarter raise optimism. The company recorded a narrower adjusted loss per share both on a reported and pro-forma basis in the quarter, which is encouraging. The uptick in overall revenues, U.S. net revenues and Med Tech revenues (all on pro-forma basis) and Med Tech revenues on a reported basis looked promising. Robust Auryon, AngioVac, AlphaVac and NanoKnife disposable sales were also recorded during the quarter. ANGO\u2019s Zacks Rank & Key Picks AngioDynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Positive Points AngioDynamics Inc ( NASDAQ:ANGO ) reported a strong second quarter with total worldwide revenue of $73 million, representing a 9% year-over-year growth. The MedTech segment showed impressive performance, growing 25% year-over-year, driven by growth across all platforms. The mechanical thrombectomy business, including Alphavac and Angiovac, grew approximately 46% over the second quarter of last year. The company achieved positive adjusted EBITDA of $3.1 million and generated $2.5 million in operating cash flow. Significant progress was made with the Nanoknife system, including an expanded FDA indication for prostate tissue ablation and a new CPT code for reimbursement. Negative Points The Med Device segment revenue was flat compared to the prior year, indicating challenges in growth outside the MedTech segment. Gross margin decreased by 10 basis points compared to the previous year, primarily due to inflationary pressures and costs associated with the transition to outsourced manufacturing. Adjusted EPS was a loss of $0.04 per share, although improved from a loss of $0.08 per share in the previous year. The company expects to utilize approximately $10 million of cash in the third quarter before returning to cash generation in the fourth quarter. There are ongoing challenges with the transition to outsourced manufacturing, which may create some under absorption in the back half of the fiscal year. Q & A Highlights Q : What drove the acceleration in AngioVac and how sustainable is it? Also, what are the plans for Alphavac's commercial execution? A : James Clemmer, CEO, explained that the synergy between AngioVac and Alphavac is driving growth. The sales and marketing teams are fully trained, leading to cross-selling opportunities. The company is adding new resources and leveraging existing relationships to maintain momentum. Stephen Trowbridge, CFO, added that the comprehensive portfolio offering is a significant advantage, and the positive feedback from physicians supports continued growth. Story Continues Q : How do you view the recent M&A activity in the market, and what changes might it bring to your commercial plans? A : Stephen Trowbridge, CFO, stated that while they are assessing the impact of recent M&A activity, AngioDynamics will continue to leverage its combined portfolio and invest in sales and marketing resources. The company is well-positioned to continue taking market share and driving growth. Q : Can you provide an update on the potential indication expansion for Arion into Iliofemoral DVT and Coronary? A : James Clemmer, CEO, mentioned that while they believe Arion could perform well in these areas, further R&D and regulatory clearances are needed. The company is evaluating the best use of resources to maximize shareholder value and will provide more details once decisions are made. Q : What is the outlook for mechanical thrombectomy growth in the second half of the year? A : Stephen Trowbridge, CFO, indicated that mechanical thrombectomy is expected to be a significant contributor to growth, with continued double-digit growth anticipated. The company is pleased with the first-half performance and expects sequential and year-over-year growth to continue. Q : How is the transition to outsourced manufacturing impacting gross margins, and what should we expect in the back half of the year? A : Stephen Trowbridge, CFO, explained that while the mix shift towards MedTech is a tailwind for gross margins, the transition to outsourced manufacturing is causing some under-absorption of overhead costs. The company is on track with the manufacturing transfer, which will ultimately benefit gross margins and the bottom line.

The decision by the American Medical Association\u2019s (\"AMA\") CPT\u00ae Editorial Panel will facilitate reimbursement for healthcare providers performing IRE ablation procedures and enables broader access to the NanoKnife System for patients. The new codes will be effective, with physician Relative Value Units (RVUs) attached, on January 1, 2026. With these new CPT\u00ae Category I codes, healthcare providers will be able to bill more precisely for the treatments provided and should achieve broader insurance coverage and defined reimbursement rates for NanoKnife procedures, increasing market access to this minimally invasive IRE technology. NanoKnife System Receives FDA 510(k) Clearance for Prostate Tissue Ablation In December, subsequent to the end of the quarter, the Company received FDA 510(k) clearance for the NanoKnife System for prostate tissue ablation. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide, with approximately 1.5 million new cases diagnosed annually. 1 Many of these patients seek alternatives to radical procedures that can lead to significant, long-term urological side effects. 2 The NanoKnife System is the first and only non-thermal, radiation-free, ablation technology designed to treat prostate tissue by using IRE technology, offering patients a minimally invasive option for prostate treatment. The NanoKnife System minimizes the life-altering complications often associated with traditional treatments by selectively targeting prostate tissue while preserving critical functions. As the Company expands its global footprint and increases access to the technology, the Company is launching comprehensive education and awareness campaigns to empower physicians with hands-on training and clinical support while engaging patients through innovative outreach initiatives. NanoKnife System Hit All Primary Endpoints in PRESERVE Study The NanoKnife System\u2019s clearance followed the completion of the pivotal PRESERVE clinical study and submission of results in September of 2024. The PRESERVE clinical study met its primary effectiveness endpoint demonstrating the performance of the NanoKnife System for the ablation of prostate tissue in patients with intermediate-risk PCa. At 12-months post-procedure, 84.0% of men were free from in-field, clinically significant disease. In addition, the study demonstrated strong quality of life outcomes with respect to short-term urinary continence and sexual function preservation. 3 The study\u2019s results validated the robust safety and clinical efficacy profile of the NanoKnife System, reinforcing findings from more than 32 clinical studies performed around the world involving over 2,600 patients. 3 Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Guidance For fiscal year 2025: The Company continues to expect net sales to be in the range of $282 to $288 million, representing growth of between 4.2% \u2013 6.4% over fiscal 2024 pro forma revenue of $270.7 million The Company now expects Med Tech net sales to grow in the range of 12% to 15%, an increase from 10% to 12% The Company now expects Med Device net sales to be flat, a decrease from 1% to 3% The Company continues to expect Gross margin to be approximately 52% to 53% The Company now expects Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1.0 to $3.0 million, an increase from the previous guidance of a loss of $2.5 million to $0. The updated guidance compares to a pro forma Adjusted EBITDA loss of $3.2 million in fiscal 2024 The Company now expects Adjusted loss per share in the range of $0.34 to $0.38, an improvement from the previous guidance of a loss per share of $0.38 to $0.42.

About the NanoKnife System The NanoKnife System utilizes Irreversible Electroporation technology to effectively destroy targeted cells without the use of thermal energy by delivering high-voltage pulses, creating permanent nanopores within the cell membrane. This stimulus induces an apoptotic-like cellular death in the targeted tissue, resulting in a complete ablation of the targeted tissue. 1 Visit nanoknife.com for full product information. United States: The NanoKnife System with six outputs is indicated for surgical ablation of soft tissue, including prostate tissue. Canada: The NanoKnife System is a medical device for cell membrane electroporation. Electroporation is a phenomenon that occurs in cell membranes as cells are exposed to an electrical field of sufficiently high intensity. The electric field acts as a physical stimulus, bringing about alterations in cell membranes that result in increased permeability. European Union: The NanoKnife System is indicated for the ablation of prostate tissue in patients with intermediate risk prostate cancer. About AngioDynamics, Inc.
