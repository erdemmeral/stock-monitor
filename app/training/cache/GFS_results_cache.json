[{"text": "Global Foundaries Inc. (GFS): This Stock Is Hurting From DeepSeek AI News That Could Turn Into Multibaggers Jabran Kundi Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 10:32 PM 3 min read We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Hurting From DeepSeek AI News That Could Turn Into Multibaggers . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Global Foundaries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) stands against the other stocks. US semiconductor stocks are getting hammered after the Chinese launched an AI model that has many questioning United States dominance in the AI space. China is currently facing restrictions on importing state-of-the-art semiconductor equipment needed for AI training. The launch of DeepSeek AI despite these restrictions is an eye-opener for Western tech companies, and the investor sentiment is reflecting it. As market participants scamper to gather more information on China\u2019s progress, we decided to look at stocks that are not only taking a hit from this news but also provide an attractive buy-the-dip opportunity. Against the backdrop of Project Stargate, a US government initiative to pump private sector investments into AI infrastructure, these companies also offer a potential multi-bagger opportunity. Usually, it is the low market cap companies that become multibaggers. However, the failure rate when betting on these companies is quite high. We therefore chose companies with a market cap between $10 and $25 billion. In this way, our list contains businesses that are already established and will thrive on the boost provided by Project Stargate while successfully managing any headwinds. We believe the downside to these stocks is minimal because of the already sound fundamentals of these companies. Is GlobalFoundries Inc. (GFS) Undervalued Semiconductor Stock to Buy According to Analysts? A technician holding a complex printed circuit board with microcontrollers, showing the company's expertise in powering devices. Global Foundaries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) Global Foundaries Inc. is a semiconductor foundry that develops a wide range of semiconductor chips by using advanced technologies. It produces mobile application processors, network processors, power management units, and other semiconductor devices. The company\u2019s stock is down over 3% in pre-market trading. A disappointing year of trading has seen the stock down 30% mainly due to concerns about its growth. Apart from the Smart Mobile Devices segment, growth prospects are limited for the company. However, it continues to be a key beneficiary of the CHIPS ACT and with the US government about to double down on AI spending through Project Stargate, there could be more money flowing through the company. One weakness of the company is that it struggles to compete when it comes to advanced nodes, meaning a lot of future growth in data centers may be out of reach for the company. GFS operates in the 12nm technology market while most of the industry operates in a range from 5nm to 16nm. Most of this downside could already be priced into the stock though. Story Continues Overall GFS ranks 5th on our list of the stocks that are hurting from DeepSeek AI news that could turn into multibaggers. While we acknowledge the potential of GFS as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as GFS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock .

(GFS) Among the Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks to Buy According to Analysts? Rizwan Siddiqui Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 4:56 AM 4 min read In This Article: GFS -0.17% We recently published a list of 10 Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks to Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where GlobalFoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) stands against other undervalued semiconductor stocks to buy according to analysts. Global market intelligence firm IDC, in its most recent report, projected a 15% growth for the global semiconductor market in 2025, driven by the relentless rise in demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC). According to their analysts, this surge will be fueled by forthcoming upgrades in key application markets, notably cloud data centers. Further emphasizing the industry\u2019s promising growth outlook, Nicolas Gaudois, head of Asia-Pacific technology research at UBS, stated in a recent CNBC interview that AI-compute will continue to underpin growth in 2025. He observed: \u201cThe 21% growth in the semiconductor market was mostly driven by AI-compute demand while non-AI growth actually declined. In 2025, AI would remain the growth driver with 40% growth but we expect non-AI portion to also grow by 17% due to several factors such as autos and industrial markets growth improving, restocking (customers buying for their inventories) in those markets and also increase in semiconductor content in devices to support edge (on-device) AI.\u201d Nicolas also suggested that GPU chipmakers and foundries will remain the main beneficiaries of AI demand and will make the most money from it. With the semiconductor space ripe for further growth, we have picked 10 semiconductor stocks that are undervalued and are best placed to benefit from this growth. Our Methodology To identify the 10 undervalued semiconductor stocks, we carried out thorough research and used stock screeners to compile a list of U.S.-listed companies. Our criteria included a market capitalization of over $2 billion, an expected share price upside of at least 10%, and a Forward PE ratio below 30x. Ultimately, the stocks were ranked in ascending order of their upside potential. These stocks are also popular among elite hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ( see more details here ). Is GlobalFoundries Inc. (GFS) Undervalued Semiconductor Stock to Buy According to Analysts? A technician holding a complex printed circuit board with microcontrollers, showing the company's expertise in powering devices. Story Continues GlobalFoundries Inc. (NASDAQ: GFS ) Upside Potential: 16% Fwd. PE: 28.0 GlobalFoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) is a US-based semiconductor foundry that manufactures integrated circuits for various markets, including automotive, mobile devices, Internet of Things (IoT), data centers, and communications infrastructure. The company is advantageously positioned within the North American semiconductor ecosystem, especially given the recent escalations in chip export restrictions and the US efforts to bring production closer to home. Before leaving office in January 2025, the Biden Administration imposed new curbs on exports to China and other countries to block China\u2019s access to advanced technology. These restrictions over the past 5-7 years have driven supply chain diversification in the US, bringing substantial benefits to GlobalFoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS). GlobalFoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) is also making substantial investments to significantly enhance its production capacity and advance its technology development efforts within the U.S. In November 2024, the company secured $1.5 billion in government funding under the CHIPS and Science Act, contributing to its broader domestic production expansion plan, which totals $13 billion over the next decade. In mid-January 2025, GlobalFoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) announced a plan to create an advanced packaging and photonics center within its New York manufacturing facility. The overall investment is expected to be $575 million, with an additional R&D investment of $186 million over the next 10 years. Overall, GFS ranks 8th on our list of undervalued semiconductor stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of GFS to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GFS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock .

Donald Trump is turning out to be the spark to take artificial intelligence investments to new heights. Just days after repealing an executive order to regulate AI risks, the US president unveiled a $500 billion private sector initiative. Stargate is the project that underscores how companies are racing against time to position themselves amid the AI revolution. \"The Stargate Project is a new company which intends to [build] new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States,\" OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank said in a joint statement. \"This project will not only support the re-industrialization of the United States but also provide a strategic capability to protect the national security of America and its allies.\" The new AI initiative, which includes several leading AI developers, including ChatGPT creator OpenAI, paves the way for the construction of data centres needed to power and support various AI models. With Goldman Sachs estimating that AI will represent 19% of data center power demand by 2028, tech giants are racing to construct and secure data center compute capacity. The growing investment comes amid significant technological advancements made in AI, especially in machine learning and generative AI models like ChatGPT. Investments are expected to soar as companies look to gain a front seat amid the revolution and strengthen their competitive edge. However, it's unclear if these investments will pay off proportionately. The cost of training a single frontier AI model is rising exponentially, from $1,000 in 2017 to almost $200 million in 2024. The increase comes amid consistent returns to scale in AI model training data, compute capacity, and model complexity. Even though unit costs per computing operation have rapidly decreased over the same period, costs could still reach billions of dollars by 2030. By the middle of the 2030s, the hardware costs of the world's AI infrastructure might surpass $1 trillion. Amid the escalating cost concerns, physical artificial intelligence has emerged as the next frontier of AI investing. Companies are increasingly investing in robotics makers, auto suppliers and specialty semiconductor companies. The AI technology began with search bots and has since advanced to \"agentic AI,\" which includes research assistants and customer support agents. Investors examining the cutting edge of this technology are now concentrating on interactions in the real world with autonomous devices that use artificial intelligence, such as self-driving cars, drones, and robot nurses. Story Continues \u201cAs you go into 2025, agentic AI is that next inflection point here before you hit that physical AI moment ... like with everything else in the world, you have to crawl before you can walk and then run,\u201d said CFRA senior equity analyst Angelo Zino The soaring investments around AI have also given rise to exciting investment opportunities. Likewise, investors are increasingly jostling for positions in tech giants and little-known companies with exposure to revolutionary technology.

GlobalFoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 2:28 PM 6 min read In This Article: GFS -0.17% Key Insights GlobalFoundries' estimated fair value is US$42.08 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Current share price of US$42.36 suggests GlobalFoundries is potentially trading close to its fair value Analyst price target for GFS is US$48.57, which is 15% above our fair value estimate In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of GlobalFoundries Inc. ( NASDAQ:GFS ) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine. Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for GlobalFoundries Is GlobalFoundries Fairly Valued? We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.66b US$1.70b US$1.40b US$1.55b US$1.51b US$1.50b US$1.51b US$1.52b US$1.55b US$1.57b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x10 Analyst x6 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ -2.08% Est @ -0.67% Est @ 0.32% Est @ 1.01% Est @ 1.49% Est @ 1.83% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.3% US$1.5k US$1.5k US$1.1k US$1.1k US$1.0k US$934 US$865 US$807 US$757 US$712 (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$10b Story Continues We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.6%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.3%. Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$1.6b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (8.3%\u2013 2.6%) = US$29b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = US$29b\u00f7 ( 1 + 8.3%) 10 = US$13b The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$23b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$42.4, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. NasdaqGS:GFS Discounted Cash Flow January 23rd 2025 The Assumptions The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at GlobalFoundries as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.370. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for GlobalFoundries Strength Debt is not viewed as a risk. Weakness Earnings declined over the past year. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market. Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio. Threat Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market. Moving On: Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

For example, our business could be impacted by geopolitical conditions such as the ongoing political and trade tensions with China and the wars in Ukraine and Israel; domestic political developments, including with respect to the incoming U.S. presidential administration; the market for our products may develop or recover more slowly than expected or than it has in the past; we may fail to achieve the full benefits of our restructuring plan; our operating results may fluctuate more than expected; there may be significant fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows related to our revenue recognition or otherwise; a network or data security incident that allows unauthorized access to our network or data or our customers\u2019 data could result in a system disruption, loss of data or damage our reputation; we could experience interruptions or performance problems associated with our technology, including a service outage; global economic conditions could deteriorate, including due to increasing interest rates, rising inflation and any potential recession; and our expected results and planned expansions and operations may not proceed as planned if funding we expect to receive (including the awards under the CHIPS and Science Act and New York State Green CHIPS Program) is delayed or withheld for any reason. It is not possible for us to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. Moreover, we operate in a competitive and rapidly changing market, and new risks may emerge from time to time. These statements are based on our historical performance and on our current plans, estimates and projections in light of information currently available to us, and therefore you should not place undue reliance on them. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances described in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Moreover, neither we, nor any other person, assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these statements. Except to the extent required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update any information or any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, subsequent events or any other circumstances after the date hereof, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Investors are urged to review in detail the risks and uncertainties discussed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F, current reports on Form 6-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

2025, 9:15 PM 8 min read In This Article: INTC -0.26% GFS -0.17% SSNLF 0.00% (Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden\u2019s $52 billion bid to transform the domestic chip industry \u2014 one of the most ambitious pieces of US industrial policy since World War II \u2014 is about to enter a pivotal stage: life under a new administration. Most Read from Bloomberg Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen The Biden staffers overseeing implementation of the bipartisan 2022 Chips and Science Act are wrapping up work this week and preparing to hand over duties when Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. They had the task of allocating $39 billion in grant funding \u2014 along with loans and tax breaks \u2014 to usher in a chip-factory building boom. That\u2019s on top of separate money for research and development and international semiconductor programs. Most of the grant funding has been awarded, and the initiative has spurred more than $400 billion in planned company investments. But much of the job remains unfinished \u2014 and broader upheaval in the chip industry will only add to the challenges. Two of the program\u2019s biggest participants, Intel Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co., are mired in slumps. And getting many of the new factories up and running will take years. But the amount of activity that\u2019s already underway constitutes an \u201cinflection point\u201d for the US semiconductor industry, the Commerce Department\u2019s Mike Schmidt, who has led the Chips Act rollout for more than two years, said during a wide-ranging interview. It \u201cputs us in a position to be hugely successful going forward.\u201d The goal is to reduce reliance on Asia for the tiny components that power everything from microwaves to missiles. If the planned projects work out, the country will boost manufacturing across the entire semiconductor supply chain and make around a fifth of the world\u2019s advanced processors by the end of the decade \u2014 up from near-zero today. So far, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has been a highlight of the effort. After a rocky start that triggered a debate over whether the US can successfully execute industrial policy, the chipmaker now has Arizona facilities that outperform comparable factories back home. It recently began commercial production at its first Phoenix plant and plans to bring its most advanced technology to the US in the future, albeit only after it debuts in Taiwan. Story Continues But the two other key makers of leading-edge processors, Intel and Samsung, have both scaled back their manufacturing ambitions: Intel by postponing projects in other countries, and Samsung by reducing the size of its Texas investment. Intel also is seeking a chief executive officer after ousting Pat Gelsinger last year, and it\u2019s unclear what strategy a new leader will pursue. Schmidt acknowledged that some Chips Act participants may change their plans even after striking final deals with government officials. \u201cThe program will evolve with that,\u201d he said. Then there\u2019s the question of what Trump will do. Before the election, he described the Chips Act as \u201cso bad\u201d and suggested tariffs would be a better solution. But Trump\u2019s cabinet pick who would oversee the program, Howard Lutnick, has signaled that he\u2019ll stay the course. Lutnick told Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in a recent meeting that he\u2019s committed to the initiative, she said at a staff gathering last week, according to people who were present. A Commerce spokesperson declined to comment, and a representative of Trump\u2019s transition team didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The law enjoys broad support on Capitol Hill, though Republicans have indicated that they want to repeal what they see as \u201csocial\u201d provisions of the Chips Act. That could involve eliminating labor-friendly regulations or environmental requirements. There is always the possibility that Trump\u2019s team tries to reopen negotiations for binding deals. Vivek Ramaswamy, who will help lead an external government efficiency advisory body for the new administration, has pledged to review the spate of awards that Biden officials raced to finalize before leaving office. The outgoing team says those agreements are ironclad. But throughout negotiations, some companies worried that certain contractual language leaves room for Trump officials to make adjustments, according to people familiar with the discussions. A particular concern: The deals allow a wide range of government remedies, including clawing back funds, if companies violate a variety of conditions. That could be triggered by things as minor as missing a paperwork deadline. \u201cWe had to come up with a legal construct that both protected taxpayers \u2014 in a way that we thought was consistent with our programmatic objectives \u2014 while clearing the market and being commercially viable from the perspective of our applicants,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cUltimately, we got there. It was hugely challenging.\u201d All told, Biden\u2019s team completed 20 deals and reached preliminary agreements for 14 others. Some of those awards include loans, though officials wound up using very little of their $75 billion lending capacity. For most companies, the biggest chunk of federal support will come from 25% tax credits. But it\u2019s \u201cvery, very clear that the grants have been the most impactful part of what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d Schmidt said. Asked whether the US could have won the same company investments with much larger tax breaks \u2014 say, 50% \u2014 rather than this approach, Schmidt said that direct funding negotiations provided crucial \u201cleverage to secure specific commitments.\u201d That included TSMC\u2019s public pledge to build a third facility in Arizona, Schmidt said, as well as confidential agreements with Samsung and GlobalFoundries Inc. to produce specific older-generation chips that are important to national security. \u201cThat kind of stuff doesn\u2019t happen for the tax credits, right?\u201d Schmidt said. Asked whether tariffs could have lured chipmakers to American soil, as Trump suggested, Schmidt said that tactic has \u201ca role to play in industrial strategy.\u201d He pointed to a recent Biden administration trade probe that could lead to tariffs on less-advanced Chinese-made semiconductors. \u201cBut there\u2019s no question,\u201d Schmidt said, \u201cthat the incentives provided by the Chips Act were essential.\u201d Looking ahead, Intel is perhaps the biggest source of uncertainty. The Silicon Valley icon is due to get the largest Chips Act award, and it set out under Gelsinger to spend $100 billion on factories in four US states \u2014 including a flagship facility in Ohio. But in the two years since Biden called the Ohio site a \u201cfield of dreams,\u201d the company has lost Wall Street\u2019s confidence, cut 15% of its workforce and delayed its factory timelines. Intel remains committed to its US projects, company and government officials have said, even as it pulled back from other investments in Europe and Asia. Government money will only be disbursed as those plants hit construction and production milestones \u2014 and as Intel reaches specific technology goals. But at a senior level, Biden officials recognize that Intel\u2019s success could require more drastic steps. The chipmaker\u2019s current leadership says it\u2019s still an open question whether the company gets split up, which could have serious consequences for the manufacturing business, particularly if Intel chooses to sell any of its factories. (There are some ownership constraints built into Intel\u2019s Chips Act award, which effectively gives the government a say in the company\u2019s future.) One idea that\u2019s gotten some attention from senior government officials is a possible deal between Intel and GlobalFoundries, according to people familiar with the conversations. Some key officials think GlobalFoundries could be a compelling partner because it\u2019s already a trusted Pentagon supplier, the people said, and Intel has a $3 billion agreement to make chips for the military. GlobalFoundries is also the only other major chip foundry based in the US, so the result would be one American company that makes everything from routine semiconductors to cutting-edge processors. One potential hitch: Mubadala Investment Co., the investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government, owns about 80% of GlobalFoundries. But while the idea has come up in multiple meetings between government and GlobalFoundries officials over the past several months, plans haven\u2019t progressed much past a thought exercise, the people said. GlobalFoundries exited leading-edge production years ago because it couldn\u2019t win enough orders to sustain high levels of investment, and it doesn\u2019t have the money for an acquisition. That\u2019s not unlike the challenge currently facing Intel, and it\u2019s one reason that the US needs investment from foreign firms to achieve its semiconductor goals. Shares of GlobalFoundries gained as much as 8.7% to $44.50 on Friday after Bloomberg News reported on the discussions. Intel, lifted by earlier takeover speculation, rose 8.3% to $21.31 as of 1:08 p.m. in New York. Representatives for Intel, GlobalFoundries and the Commerce Department declined to comment. Asked about the risks of new Intel leadership changing its investment plans or splitting up the business, Schmidt said that his office has confidence in the company and wants to see it succeed \u2014 but the program also has spread out its bets. \u201cIntel\u2019s an important part of the portfolio,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one piece of the portfolio.\u201d --With assistance from Ian King.

(GFS): Advancing Quantum and AI Technologies Through Strategic Partnerships with Quantum Motion and Lightmatter Abdul Rahman Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 8:43 PM 5 min read In This Article: GFS -0.17% We recently compiled a list of the Top 10 Unlikely AI Stocks with Tremendous Upside Potential . In this article, we are going to take a look at where GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) stands against the other AI stocks. Artificial intelligence was the main force that drove the US stock market to record highs last year. While major indices have since pulled back, the big question is whether the AI trade is fully priced in. Nothing could be further from the truth, as we are still in the early stages of AI development and revolution. Tech giants pumping billions of dollars into data centres, building AI platforms and investing in startups affirm that AI growth is all but starting. According to former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, we are still in the early stages of the AI revolution, and significant changes are on the horizon. \u201cWe\u2019re in the beginnings of this generative AI revolution as we all know. And we\u2019re at the beginning of a new generation of foundation models that are able to do reasoning and able to do long thinking,\u201d Sutskever said. After years of building the foundation to support the AI revolution, generative AI is entering a new phase of advanced foundation models that should take AI reasoning and thinking to new heights. Likewise, Sutskever insists we are on the cusp of super-intelligent, self-aware AI capable of reasoning like humans as tech giants work on game-changing innovations. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang shares similar sentiments, who insists there is about $1 trillion worth of computers that need updating for accelerated computing. Consequently, AI is looked upon to bring about much-needed changes by improving business efficiency and developing game-changing products. This implies that there is plenty of room for AI-driven revenue growth that should benefit many companies. Amid the stock run-up experienced in 2024, investment professionals are also optimistic that the trend will persist in 2025. Companies should start reaping the rewards of adopting generative AI as others start generating some returns from their AI investments. Similarly, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives expects a 25% rise in tech stocks in 2025, keeping up with the momentum enjoyed last year. While most of the gains will be driven by reduced regulatory pressure under President Donald Trump's administration, a more AI-friendly environment will also significantly impact the upward momentum. \"We believe tech stocks will be robust in 2025 on the shoulders of the AI Revolution and $2 trillion+ of incremental AI cap-ex over the next 3 years,\u201d analysts led by Daniel Ives said in a note. Story Continues Some cracks are starting to emerge amid the expected growth around artificial intelligence. Although generative AI has advanced rapidly over the last two years, Silicon Valley has grown increasingly concerned in recent weeks that the pace of advancement is slowing. The lack of advancement between models published by the industry's major players is one early sign. The primary issue might be that AI firms are running out of data on which to train their models. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ( see more details here ).
