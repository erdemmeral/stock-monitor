[{"text": "EWCZ vs. ELF: Which Stock Is the Better Value Option? Zacks Equity Research Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 7:40 PM 2 min read In This Article: ELF -6.48% Investors interested in Cosmetics stocks are likely familiar with European Wax Center, Inc. (EWCZ) and e.l.f. Beauty (ELF). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look. The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits. European Wax Center, Inc. and e.l.f. Beauty are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that EWCZ is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. However, value investors will care about much more than just this. Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels. The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value. EWCZ currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.38, while ELF has a forward P/E of 30.65. We also note that EWCZ has a PEG ratio of 1.26. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. ELF currently has a PEG ratio of 1.49. Another notable valuation metric for EWCZ is its P/B ratio of 3.90. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, ELF has a P/B of 8.57. These are just a few of the metrics contributing to EWCZ's Value grade of B and ELF's Value grade of F. EWCZ is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that EWCZ is likely the superior value option right now. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Center (EWCZ) Surges 8.0%: Is This an Indication of Further Gains?

This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 23.5% gain over the past four weeks. European Wax Center has been benefiting from its focus on implementing innovative marketing and technology solutions, which helps the company attract new guests while strengthening engagement with current ones.\u00a0 The company\u2019s franchise partners remain highly committed to long-term development, providing a solid foundation for continued expansion. European Wax Center recently offered an update on its anticipated performance for fiscal 2024, wherein it envisions system-wide sales to be near the top end of its earlier provided view, backed by solid fourth-quarter Wax Pass sales and continued loyalty of key guests. This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.05 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -50%. Revenues are expected to be $52.13 million, down 7.5% from the year-ago quarter. While earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

Industry: Cosmetics Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2400282/3-resilient-cosmetic-stocks-to-monitor-in-a-challenging-market Companies in the Zacks Cosmetics industry are navigating a dynamic macroeconomic environment, facing external headwinds that are impacting consumer demand and putting pressure on the sector. The tough demand landscape is affecting sales for many cosmetic companies, while higher production costs are straining profitability and operational efficiency. Despite these challenges, companies like The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. , Helen of Troy Ltd. and European Wax Center, Inc. have seen positive results from initiatives focused on enhancing digital capabilities and driving innovation. These strategies are helping them adapt to market shifts and maintain growth against a tough economic backdrop. About the Industry The Zacks Cosmetics industry includes companies that provide beauty and personal care products. Players in the industry manufacture, distribute, sell and market skincare, fragrance, makeup and hair care products. Many firms in the market sell products via sales representatives, whereas some do the same through retailers, independent and chain drug stores and pharmacies, upscale perfumeries, department stores and beauty salons. These companies also operate through retailer websites, third-party distributors and in-flight and duty-free shops. Some products offered by industry participants include moisturizers, serums, toners and cleansers under skincare; perfume sprays, candles and soaps under fragrance; lipsticks, mascaras, powders, eye shadows, foundation and nail polishes under makeup; and shampoos, conditioner and hair color products under hair care. Trends Shaping the Future of the Cosmetics Industry Challenging Economic Conditions : Cosmetic companies are navigating a tough macroeconomic environment marked by reduced consumer spending and fluctuating retail replenishment cycles. As a result of heightened living costs, consumers are becoming more selective, prioritizing essential goods while cutting back on non-essential items like cosmetics. This shift in spending habits is creating a challenging demand landscape for many beauty brands. In addition, higher costs for packaging, ingredients, transportation and promotions are driving up operational expenses and squeezing profit margins, adding pressure to several cosmetic companies in this highly competitive beauty space. Story Continues International Risk Factors : Several industry players face potential risks due to their global footprint, including exposure to adverse foreign currency fluctuations. Political unrest, like turmoil related to geopolitical events, might disrupt market access and operational continuity. Trade conflicts, tariffs, sanctions and other restrictions may also affect their performance. Innovation & Digitization Are Major Drivers : Innovation and digitization are key growth drivers in the beauty and skincare market. Consumers are increasingly seeking unique products that combine advanced technology with expert scientific formulations. In response to these evolving preferences, cosmetic companies are continuously innovating and introducing new products. The rising consumer interest in organic and clean beauty products has fueled market growth. Enhancing e-commerce capabilities is a key priority, with advancements like virtual try-on tools, seamless digital payment systems and enhanced online marketing strategies gaining traction. In addition, many beauty brands are expanding their product portfolios through strategic acquisitions and partnerships to stay competitive in this rapidly changing industry.

dynamic macroeconomic environment, facing external headwinds that are impacting consumer demand and putting pressure on the sector. The tough demand landscape is affecting sales for many cosmetic companies, while higher production costs are straining profitability and operational efficiency. Despite these challenges, companies like The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. EL, Helen of Troy Limited HELE and European Wax Center, Inc. EWCZ have seen positive results from initiatives focused on enhancing digital capabilities and driving innovation. These strategies are helping them adapt to market shifts and maintain growth against a tough economic backdrop. About the Industry The Zacks Cosmetics industry includes companies that provide beauty and personal care products. Players in the industry manufacture, distribute, sell and market skincare, fragrance, makeup and hair care products. Many firms in the market sell products via sales representatives, whereas some do the same through retailers, independent and chain drug stores and pharmacies, upscale perfumeries, department stores and beauty salons. These companies also operate through retailer websites, third-party distributors and in-flight and duty-free shops. Some products offered by industry participants include moisturizers, serums, toners and cleansers under skincare; perfume sprays, candles and soaps under fragrance; lipsticks, mascaras, powders, eye shadows, foundation and nail polishes under makeup; and shampoos, conditioner and hair color products under hair care. Trends Shaping the Future of the Cosmetics Industry Challenging Economic Conditions : Cosmetic companies are navigating a tough macroeconomic environment marked by reduced consumer spending and fluctuating retail replenishment cycles. As a result of heightened living costs, consumers are becoming more selective, prioritizing essential goods while cutting back on non-essential items like cosmetics. This shift in spending habits is creating a challenging demand landscape for many beauty brands. In addition, higher costs for packaging, ingredients, transportation and promotions are driving up operational expenses and squeezing profit margins, adding pressure to several cosmetic companies in this highly competitive beauty space. International Risk Factors : Several industry players face potential risks due to their global footprint, including exposure to adverse foreign currency fluctuations. Political unrest, like turmoil related to geopolitical events, might disrupt market access and operational continuity. Trade conflicts, tariffs, sanctions and other restrictions may also affect their performance. Innovation & Digitization Are Major Drivers : Innovation and digitization are key growth drivers in the beauty and skincare market. Consumers are increasingly seeking unique products that combine advanced technology with expert scientific formulations. In response to these evolving preferences, cosmetic companies are continuously innovating and introducing new products. The rising consumer interest in organic and clean beauty products has fueled market growth. Enhancing e-commerce capabilities is a key priority, with advancements like virtual try-on tools, seamless digital payment systems and enhanced online marketing strategies gaining traction. In addition, many beauty brands are expanding their product portfolios through strategic acquisitions and partnerships to stay competitive in this rapidly changing industry.

As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 1.7% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 4.5% below. In light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady.

Despite the top-line beat, it was still a mixed quarter for the company with a significant miss of analysts\u2019 EBITDA estimates. Executive Chairman and CEO James L. Dolan said, \"The vision for Sphere has always included a global network of venues, and our recently announced plans for a second Sphere in Abu Dhabi mark a significant milestone toward that goal. We are confident in the opportunities ahead for Sphere and believe we are well-positioned to drive long-term shareholder value. \" Sphere Entertainment Total Revenue Sphere Entertainment achieved the fastest revenue growth of the whole group.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 5 Growth Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Disclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to the financial measures presented in this release in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), the Company has included certain non-GAAP financial measures in this release, including Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they enable management, investors, and others to assess the operating performance of the Company. We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We believe that EBITDA, which eliminates the impact of certain expenses that we do not believe reflect our underlying business performance, provides useful information to investors to assess the performance of our business. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the impact of certain additional non-cash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing performance of our core operations. These items include non-cash equity-based compensation expense, non-cash gains and losses on remeasurement of our tax receivable agreement liability, contractual cash interest on our tax receivable agreement liability, transaction costs and other one-time expenses and/or gains. We define Adjusted net income (loss) as net income (loss) adjusted for the impact of certain additional non-cash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing performance of our core operations. These items include non-cash equity-based compensation expense, debt extinguishment costs, non-cash gains and losses on remeasurement of our tax receivable agreement liability, contractual cash interest on our tax receivable agreement liability, transaction costs and other one-time expenses and/or gains. This release includes forward-looking guidance for certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income. These measures will differ from net income (loss), determined in accordance with GAAP, in ways similar to those described in the reconciliations at the end of our earnings releases. We are not able to provide, without unreasonable effort, guidance for net income (loss), determined in accordance with GAAP, or a reconciliation of guidance for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income (loss) to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because the Company is not able to predict with reasonable certainty the amount or nature of all items that will be included in net income (loss).

Leisure facilities companies often sell experiences rather than tangible products, and in the last decade-plus, consumers have slowly shifted their spending from \"things\" to \"experiences\".

As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 1.7% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 4.5% below.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 5 Growth Stocks and add them to your watchlist.
