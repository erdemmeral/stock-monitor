Connelly, Chief Investment Officer. I now have the pleasure of turning the call over to Byron. Story Continues Byron Boston Thank you, Alison and good morning, everyone. We continue to advance Steinnes along the path of growing a resilient sustainable business. For the long term, we are focused on delivering value at the intersection of capital markets and housing finance where we believe there will be sustained opportunity to generate compelling yields. Demographic trends continue to support our thesis for financing residential real estate, the single-family housing market its own resilience in the face of higher interest rates and multifamily housing continues to be an area of growth due to the high demand for housing. The team is diligently assessing the best risk adjusted returns which currently remain an agency backed single family residential MBS as the Chairman and Co-CEO, I'm excited about the company we are and the company we are becoming. We are well positioned for the global macroeconomic landscape which is moving rapidly. Upcoming policy changes are likely to have a significant impact on people, economies and financial markets. The investment environment continues to offer significant long-term value in the agency RMBS market. And as SMR will describe the team is focused on flexibility as we navigate the year ahead. Smriti Popenoe Thank you, Byron. Today, I'm pleased to announce the appointment of T.J. Connolly as our Chief Investment Officer. T.J. has a brilliant mind and is a wonderful person whose career I followed since our early days together at SOAC. It has been a delight working with him at Dynex since 2023. He embodies our core values and is already a key member of the Dynex leadership team. I'm really excited for his fresh perspective on our investing strategy and I wish him great success in this role, Byron and I continue to build the company across the dimensions of people process and technology in 2024 we achieved meaningful progress. Building a solid foundation for our company, we added three new board members with strong skill sets across technology risk, asset management and strategy. We grew our common equity capital to over $1 billion and deployed it wisely as the market gave us opportunities. The year over year growth in our common capital base of over 40% drove significant benefits to scale which Rob will outline in more detail. We expanded our investor outreach, meaningfully increased trading liquidity in our stock, raised our dividend to reflect our confidence in the return environment, all of which has translated to a solid improvement in the price to book ratio. We believe Dynex deserves and will attain a premium to book value valuation. The share price does not yet reflect the meaningful benefits of future growth, much improved liquidity in the stock nor the ethically managed high quality liquid investment product we deliver, we will continue to drive effort in this direction. Most importantly, we are building a track record to be proud of. Through December 2024, among agency focused mortgage rates, the Dynex team has generated the leading total shareholder return for one, three and five years inclusive of the dividend. A result produced during some of the most challenging market conditions post great financial crisis when you include nonagency and credit focused mortgage rates with market caps above $500 million, Dynex leads on a one and five year basis and has the second best record on a three year basis. Last year, 7% total economic return and 13.7% total shareholder return was delivered in an environment where the 10 year treasury yield made 200 basis point round trips and mortgage spreads though better behaved in 2023 traded in a 40 basis point range. We are producing strong industry leading returns. The experience and expertise of the team has been invaluable in building this record and will continue to be a differentiator for Dynex in the future. I'll now turn it over to Rob and T.J. for a more detailed financial picture of 2024, our current thinking and outlook for 2025. Robert Colligan Thank you and good morning to everyone joining today's call, the Fed's three interest rate cuts in the second half of 2024 provided a great tailwind for our portfolio. And for the first time in two years, the yield curve has un inverted, allowing us to invest in assets with a positive carry while the swap book is still net positive and adds net spread to the portfolio. During the fourth quarter, the 10 year treasury was up nearly 80 basis points and from the end of the third quarter, mortgage threads were broadly wider. Book value ended the quarter at $12.70 per share and the economic return was 1% for the quarter and 7.4% for the year. Leverage was up as we added pools and TBAs during the fourth quarter during periods of spread widening. Interest income was up from the third quarter from the active addition of higher yielding assets into the portfolio, while older lower yielding assets continue to pay down. We kept their financing books short in anticipation of cuts to the fed funds rate and we leaned into lower borrowing costs as soon as they were available. In the second half of 2024 and particularly in the fourth quarter, we rotated a large portion of our hedge position from features to swaps. Given this change, you'll see an improvement in our net interest spread as the periodic swap income received is included in spread metric and has enhanced portfolio yield. T.J. will cover head strategy and construction more in his comments. Please see page 6 of the earnings release covering the hedging portfolio and page 10 in the earnings presentation. For more detail on this topic. In the fourth quarter, we raised $64 million of new capital and we continue to keep ample levels of liquidity to deploy into markets. Like we're seeing now, marked by higher yields, wider spreads, lower financing costs and the supportive derivative market to hedge our portfolio. For the full year, we grew our common capital base by $332 million and drove our expense ratio down by 70 basis points. Year over year, we've kept non-compensation expenses essentially flat to 2023 while executing on several important strategic initiatives particularly on the it and marketing fronts. Expense management will continue to be a focus going into 2025 to ensure our expenses, create value for the portfolio and our shareholders underscoring the benefits of scale as we have grown, we have narrowed the price to book ratio which has been a significant benefit for our shareholders. This allows us to continue to grow, achieve scale and deploy capital into an attractive market. A read at scale is a more valuable company and will continue to attract a higher price to book multiple over the long term. I'll now turn it over to T.J. for the investment portfolio outlook. T.J. Connelly Thank you, Rob. It's an honor to have the opportunity to lead the investment process at Dynex. As only the third CIO since 2008, I have tremendous examples of stewardship to guide me in this role. I joined this team in 2023 for two reasons. First, after 12 years, working with the Dynex team as an external partner, I had the opportunity to get to know nearly everyone at the company and I could say without question that this is one of the best and most underappreciated mortgage investment teams out there. Second, the opportunities in mortgage backed securities remain some of the best I've seen in my career. Government intervention continues to ease allowing private capital to earn a significant interest income premium relative to other fixed income products. Extracting the yield in mortgages requires immense skill and discipline. I continue to believe that Dynex's team and infrastructure are uniquely positioned to deliver equity like returns from this fixed income product. And I'm excited to leverage this team's talents for a larger investor base. Lawful risk management focused on leverage and liquidity will remain the hallmark of our process. Government policy has always been part of investing in US fixed income. This year, investors will likely hear more about the potential for GSE reform. Our base case for the coming year is that talk of reform could create volatility and spread, likely offering an opportunity for us to deploy capital accretively, much like we did last year around the election. GSE privatization could have significant implications for housing finance especially as stretched affordability and inflation continues to weigh on households. Two things will be central to the dialogue. One, the GSEs need to raise significant capital to meet regulatory thresholds and two, the Treasury guarantee an existing line of credit will be critical to maintain the stability and liquidity of agency MBS. The team at Dynex monitors these developments closely and is actively engaged with Washington to remain at the forefront of policy changes. In the fourth quarter, we added value in four ways. We raised capital at attractive levels deployed that capital when spreads widen into the election collected securities with better risk characteristics and shifted our hedges at the tights in swap spreads. Our book value also benefited from the long-dated hedges as the yield curve steepened. Specifically, we raised $64 million in new capital in the quarter. We deployed that and the capital from previous quarters buying [$900 million], 30 year 4.5%, 5% and 5.5% coupons split about 50:50 in TBA and specified pools increasing leverage from 7.6 to 7.9 in the quarter. We like the flexibility of TBAs and balance that against the call protection in specified pools to optimize hedge costs. We continue to execute a major shift in our hedge strategy, moving over two-thirds of our hedges from futures into interest rate swaps at historically advantageous levels. Interest rate swaps can enhance our portfolio ROE by 200 to 300 basis points after adjusting for their higher initial margin requirements. The fourth quarter saw the recent ties and swap spread which we believe adequately compensate for the potential of higher treasury issues. Turning now to the outlook, the macro backdrop is evolving quickly. The US economy has shown remarkable resilience and we expect the fed to take a wait and see approach. As new administration policy changes could have a significant impact on the path of growth and inflation. We are preparing for a wider distribution of rates especially in the back end of the curve with the view that a steeper curve is the most sustainable and likely outcome. While respecting the possibility for shocks. Our framework is not to predict but to prepare and we are positioning the portfolio for pockets of volatility. There will be surprises and our robust liquidity position should allow us to navigate those moments, capitalizing on our allocation to money, good assets in our view. Agency RMBS have the best relative and absolute return potential versus other fixed income alternatives. Today's return environment is still among the best I've seen and offers the possibility of earning double digit ROEs nominal spreads on agency RMBS have been in the range of 135 to 140 basis points over seven-year treasury and 175 to 185 over swaps. These spreads offer compelling returns as is and they've stabilized in a range. Several factors support spreads remaining at these levels or even tightening. A positively sloped yield curve has been associated with healthy demand for fixed income historically and that will likely drive robust demand for agency RMBS net issuance in 2025 will likely remain modest in the $200 billion to $250 billion area with mortgage rates in the 6% to 7% range. Bond fund flows have been positive at these higher yields and could accelerate given the sizable holdings in money market funds. And finally, banks returned in 2024 buying specified tools across the coupon stack and structured agency MBS with many of the banks hedging their duration and swaps we expect the bank did can drive spread tighter over the year. Security selection will remain a focus. We have continued to diversify across coupons and specified pools that require less active hedging, avoiding mortgages with the most uncertain durations remain critical and will likely remain so for some time. Our coupon allocation reflects this view. And this is an important nuance that might get missed ETFs and other passive bond funds with current coupon TBA allocations may have optically higher yields. But those investments could underperform in environments like we saw this past October. On the financing front repo markets stabilized late in the year, particularly after the Fed made modest tweaks to the rate on the reverse repo program and made the standing repo facility slightly easier to use. Relatively small changes helped lower funding costs especially around year end. That traffic jam we wrote about in the Dynex angle on LinkedIn the fourth quarter has largely been released, mortgage repo rates relative to SOFR were around SOFR 25 basis points-plus. More recently, we're seeing spreads to SOFR less than 20 basis points, liquidity remains plentiful and I'm optimistic about mortgage repo costs in 2025. Overall, we remain a favorable investment environment. We expect that agency residential and multifamily MBS will remain the focus of our investment for many quarters to come. As the yield curve deepens, we will look for value in structured products like agency CMOs. Spreads are not yet attractive enough for us to allocate into agency CMBS. But we actively monitor relative value and would diversify as opportunities arrive. This is an exciting time for me as a mortgage investor to take over leadership of such a strong team and infrastructure yield spreads in mortgages offer a substantial margin of safety for investors. And the upside potential from eventual spread tightening is significant. Before I turn it back to Smriti, I'd like to thank the executive team and our board of directors and all our shareholders for your trust and partnership. Smriti Popenoe Thanks, T.J. The team at Dynex is at the forefront of policy discussions in Washington, providing the perspective from private capital on behalf of our shareholders and working to ensure that the MBS market remains robust and effective. As the oldest publicly traded mortgage rate. The company has seen many policy cycles. Byron and I have been preparing for shifting policy for over a decade now at Dynex. Proactive engagement, flexibility and liquidity are important parts of our strategy to navigate through this policy environment. Looking ahead, we will continue to build the business to leverage our expertise to deliver compelling yields to our shareholders from the residential real estate mortgage market. Several factors are in place to advance our track record of delivering industry leading returns. We remain an accretive investment environment in which raising and deploying capital drives long term value by creating scale and dividends. We're confident in the company's ability to deliver on our dividends propelled by current and future returns. And as always, the Dynex management team and Board are coinvested alongside you, our shareholders. We appreciate your continued support. I'll now open the call to questions. Question and Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions) Bose George, KBW. Bose George Hey, everyone. Good morning. First, can you walk through the drivers of the shift from treasury futures to the swaps this quarter and any impact that has on spreads? And also just from an accounting perspective, you noted, I guess the GAAP PPS now is closer to the I guess the EAD but does the prior, deferred gains get added like you end up with a period where the EAD ends up higher than the economic return. Robert Colligan T.J. start with the structure and then I'll get into the account. T.J. Connelly Yeah. Hi, Bose. It T.J. As we discussed, I'll talk about the market that and then turn it over to Rob. As we discussed last quarter, swap spreads reached levels where we think they more than compensate for the potential of more fiscal issuant. And as I mentioned in the credit market, I think over moving as much as we did about two-thirds of our hedges into swaps, we can add 200 to 300 basis points of marginal ROE. Robert Colligan Yeah. And on the accounting front, as we've covered and disclosed, if you look at the materials and the earnings presentation, the futures gains are taken on a straight line basis over the original hedge period. So if it was a 10 year future, we're taking that gain on a very linear basis over 10 years whereas the swaps, obviously you're going to follow the payments on the swap curve. So the time period over which those gains are obviously different than the futures, which have been taken over a straight-line basis. We'll continue to give those numbers to you each quarter as the portfolio changes. Bose George So. Okay, great. Thank you. And then actually, can we just get an update on book value quarter to date any big changes? Smriti Popenoe Yeah. Se have that, Bose, it's essentially flat since the end of the quarter. Operator Doug Harter from UBS. Doug Harter Can you talk about your strategy for continuing to grow the capital base in 2025 and how you think about issuing at a discount, given that you've achieved $1 billion size and how that might change that the pace of that might change if you started trading at a premium. Smriti Popenoe Yeah. Hi Doug. Good morning. Thanks for the question. So overall, I think the our strategy has been predicated upon the investment environment, right? And we've said that when the investment environment allows us to invest capital at ROEs that are greater than the long-term level of the dividend that we think that's an accretive environment and that's an environment in which it makes sense for us to grow the company. None of that has changed as we're coming into 2025, as T.J. mentioned, you're seeing mortgage spreads still be in the [130s, 140s] versus treasuries [170s, 180s] versus swap, these are solid healthy, ROEs that believe that we believe are long term accretive. So that hasn't changed. The second piece of this is understanding, what is it -- where do we want to get to in terms of size and how do we get there. As Rob mentioned during the call, we have seen now significant benefits to scale 70 basis points improvement in the G&A ratio. These are meaningful changes and accrue directly to the benefit of common shareholders. So that's something that we believe is still a very powerful driver and reason to continue to grow the company. And I think you've heard Byron, and I say together that, we're not interested in becoming the largest company in the space or any such thing, we believe that there's some level at which the company starts to lose strategic maneuverability. And I can tell you we're not there yet. So our intent is to continue to grow and we're going to do it the same way that we have, which is in a disciplined manner, making sure that we're investing the capital as we go along and only raising it when and if it makes sense for us to, to make the investment. Doug Harter Great, I appreciate that. In your prepared remarks you talked about the potential for GSE reform or change in ownership, can you talk about how you think the MBS market is currently pricing that in and, and kind of how you think about the potential risks that could come from, a change in the guarantee or change in the current structure. Smriti Popenoe Yeah. Thanks again and when I look at where MBS spreads are now and just what, how they behaved, even coming into year end and watching to see how they've changed as the new administration has taken shape here. To me, to us, it just seems like a very small percentage. Risk is being priced in of anything meaningfully different from where things stand today. Right. So the MBS market has discounted for the most part, the probability of change. And if there is any risk premium that's being built in the probability assigned to it is small. One of the things that we look back at over time, if you look at the earnings chart, the earnings deck, there's a page in there where we show you what happened, happened to spread from well into the [90s] and in the [90s], the GSEs operated as private entities, Byron and myself, T.J., all of us worked there. Spreads were a lot tighter than, than they are now. And so it is possible for the GSEs to operate as private entities. The market did operate in that fashion then. Spreads were a lot tighter than there wasn't an explicit guarantee for agency MBSs at the time, there was an implicit guarantee. So is it possible for things to operate in that way? I believe that, that is possible. The pathway from here to there though, there's is very difficult in our opinion and it's not clear that there's a real benefit to homeowners, of mortgage rates being substantially lower of having the GSE operate in that private structure. So for that reason and you got to weigh that against the idea of, disrupting a housing finance system that's already working. And that cost benefit is not as clear. So in our opinion, our operating assumption is yes, could, could we get there? Yes, but the hurdle to get there is actually quite substantial. Operator Trevor Cranston, JMP Securities. Trevor Cranston Hey, thanks, good morning. Follow up quick follow up question the shift in the hedge portfolio more into swaps and out of treasuries. I guess if we see swap spreads kind of stay around current levels. Would you expect that shift to continue to move more into swaps or is there some kind of continued benefit to maintaining the portion of the hedges and treasuries at this point? Thanks. T.J. Connelly Yeah. Hi, Trevor. Good morning. I'd say the hedge portfolio is roughly where we want things to be given the current market environment at this point. Trevor Cranston Okay. Got it. And then in terms of, rate sensitivities, looking at the updated tables this quarter, looks like you guys are positioned more to benefit more in a downrate scenario compared to where you were last quarter. Can you maybe just elaborate a little bit on your near term thoughts on the rate market? And I guess I'd also particularly be interested in your thoughts on how rate fall plays out over the course of the year. Thanks. T.J. Connelly Sure. Let me just address the duration profile as of quarter end. You remember that that duration profile moves with rates, and we've adjusted our hedges a little since quarter end to add to our steepener and be a bit more balanced in the parallel profiles. So I can actually update you on those numbers up 100 would now was at minus 8.2%. It's now minus 5.9% as of Thursday night, down 100 was minus 4.2%. So you see a much more balanced profile. So in that sense, I want to be clear that we're not taking duration views, we are seeking to extract the spread that's available in mortgages. And of course, with the duration uncertainty of the mortgages, the model numbers that you see there do move around. As far as our rate view, more broadly, I think that there's, as we said, the front end will probably remain a bit more -- a bit less volatile the back end. Certainly, there's a lot more uncertainty with the fiscal picture and the administration changes, what policy will look like, not just tax policy, but across the board, government policies and could impact the back end a lot more. So you could see quite a bit more volatility on the back end. But I think the front end rates will be a bit more PGG broadly speaking for mortgages. I think we can see somewhere between 5.5% and 7.5% mortgage rates and still be able to extract a lot of (multiple speakers) Smriti Popenoe The shape of the yield shape of the yield curve is now offering us the ability to earn carry, right? And you know, carry can cure a lot of ills and also keep pushing a lot of volatility. Operator Eric Hagen, BTIG. Eric Hagen Hey, thanks, good morning. Maybe actually following up on that last point you guys were just making. I mean, if we see the yield curve steepen further from here, I mean, do you envision taking maybe more risk in the portfolio? And do you think you'd accomplish that more with like a longer duration gap or is there room to raise leverage? And how much liquidity do you see maybe keeping under each of those kind of scenarios. Smriti Popenoe Hi, Eric. I think what's interesting is we when we look at what returns are being offered to us, when we buy mortgages relative to swaps, or even relative to treasuries here, these are good long term double digit returns. And so, taking risk up, we would have to -- we would really have to see meaningful meaningful tradeoff in taking that risk up relative to the return we might get from taking the risk up. So at this point, spreads are still wide. There's still a really good opportunity to earn just that incremental [175, 180] versus swaps and, and so that, that is that is a AAA good return environment as far as we're concerned. So to take risk up, the return from taking duration risk, the return from taking incremental spread risk really has to be acquitted in the long term and those would be the impetuses for us to take risk up. I'll let T.J. just tell you talk to you just about the overall view on spreads here. But I think at this point, taking those types of risks would really, we'd have to feel really confident that we're getting paid to do that. T.J. Connelly Yeah. Look, spread, volatility has come down, trading in the [130 to 150] area for the better part of the last several quarters now. I think there's still scope for spreads to move slowly, tighter, probably as implied, volatility starts to move lower in rates and once we get, deeper into this year and have a better idea of the fiscal situation, I think that's quite conceivable. Eric Hagen Yeah> I mean, for my second question here, I mean, I guess we'll just kind of follow up on all this stuff, that maybe ask about the prepayment environment. I mean, if the outlook is for rates to remain relatively high. I mean, I think you guys mentioned the opportunity for rate shocks and pockets of volatility. I mean, how do you still pricing the risk to spread? Is it, really short-term rallies and rates, the aggressive targeting that we might see from originators against that backdrop? T.J. Connelly Yeah. That's really critical and we saw what I would call it kind of a mini refi way in September really came through in the October prepayment reports. And though there are certain segments of this market that are just very, very refinanceable, and that's what I was getting at in my prepared remarks about, specified pools being very important, avoiding some of those borrowers who are going to refinance it very, very quickly. They are segments of the market extremely negatively convex. And it's been a lot about security selection and coupon selection being, a little bit lower coupons. I think we saw 6.5% and 6% prepay at very fast level in that last wave. So we're going to get those kinds of events and that's how we're preparing our portfolio for those. Operator Jason Stewart, Jenney. Jason Stewart Hey, thanks, good morning. And congrats T.J., well deserved there. I appreciate the comments on GST reform and maybe you could just touch on one topic we haven't talked about so far and that's, with the new FH fa director where you see the origination footprint of the GSE moving and whether that, has supply implications for, for the agency mortgage market. Smriti Popenoe Yeah. Hi Jason. I think it's hard to tell at this point. There's ideological biases that we know are, are are going to be there. If you just follow those ideological biases through, you would expect to see a smaller footprint, right? And higher scope for private label issuance to increase, that would be logical. If there's anything that we've learned over the past eight years, it's really like the actions and the actual policies that get implemented that matter. It's difficult to say just because someone is nominated that the policy is going to be A, B, or C and we're waiting to see what the actual actions are. T.J. Connelly Thank you, Jason, by the way, and I tend to agree the smaller footprint is ideologically a very likely path in terms of market implications in the GSE. I really want to frame how we're thinking about it. And there's going to be three waves of impact for any potential policy shifts, whether it's GSEs or otherwise. F\u1e47irst, the market's going act to the anticipated policy changes, right? You're going to get that kind of headline reaction. Then second, you're going to have the perception and reflexive period where policymakers are actually going to respond to the initial market reaction. There's going to be this back and forth reaction between markets and the messages from policymakers. And then finally, third, we're going to have the ultimate policy change implementation. So this is going to be a long process and I think there's going to be a real back and forth between markets and policymakers. Jason Stewart Yeah. Okay. That's good color. I tend to agree with you too. And then one follow-up on Bose's question was that book value number flat quarter to date as of Thursday or is that including today's rate move. Smriti Popenoe I mean, it would be as of as of the close of Friday and is net of a dividend. Operator And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to buyer in Boston for closing remarks. Byron Boston Happy New year. Thank you very, very much for joining us today and we look forward to updating you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

(DX): Why You Should Invest In This Extreme Dividend Stock Now Vardah Gill Sun, Jan 26, 2025, 3:53 AM 6 min read In This Article: DX -0.45% We recently compiled a list of the 10 Extreme Dividend Stocks to Invest in Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Dynex Capital, Inc. (NYSE:DX) stands against the other dividend stocks. In 2024, dividend stocks underperformed the broader market as attention shifted to high-flying tech stocks. The Dividend Aristocrat index, which tracks companies with a minimum of 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, rose only 6.3% compared to the broader market's impressive 27% gain. Despite this, analysts remain positive about the long-term outlook for dividend stocks, as they have historically delivered stronger performance over extended periods. Analysts believe dividend stocks could see a resurgence in 2025 due to increased market volatility. The last time these stocks outperformed the broader market was in 2022, as concerns over a potential recession pushed investors toward sectors like utilities, consumer goods, and others associated with value stocks and reliable earnings. While there\u2019s no guarantee that recession fears or a bear market will emerge in 2025, the significant rallies of 2023 and 2024\u2014which have contributed to dividend stocks lagging\u2014often lead to heightened volatility, particularly if ambitious growth projections begin to falter. Moreover, as the new administration implements its economic policies, periods of uncertainty and market disruptions could arise. In such scenarios, dividend-paying stocks, seen as stable and dependable, might become more attractive to investors seeking steady returns during turbulent times.

While analysts often suggest prioritizing stocks with a strong track record of dividend growth, the allure of high yields remains significant. Experts caution against falling for yield traps, urging investors to focus on companies that steadily enhance shareholder returns. Still, proponents of high-yield investments emphasize the importance of dividend yields in an overall investment strategy. In their study Income Illusions: Challenging the High Yield Stock Narrative , published in the March 2024 Journal of Asset Management , Yin Chen and Roni Israelov analyzed the impact of dividends on investment returns. They divided stocks into high-dividend and low-dividend categories based on the median dividend yield from the prior year. Their research, covering the top 1,500 US stocks from January 1964 to December 2021, revealed that high-dividend portfolios outperformed in both returns and risk. These portfolios achieved an average annual return of 13.8% with 15.6% volatility, compared to low-dividend portfolios, which returned 11.8% annually with a higher volatility of 21.9%. This performance gap resulted in a 3.6% difference in compound annual growth rate. In addition, high-dividend portfolios experienced smaller losses during market downturns. However, while high-dividend stocks generally performed better over the full study period, a long-short investment strategy in these stocks resulted in an annual loss of nearly 1% between 2003 and 2021, with the strongest returns recorded between 1983 and 2002. Story Continues Simply chasing high-yield stocks isn\u2019t enough; investors should also examine a company\u2019s balance sheet and overall financial health. Firms with solid financials are better positioned to increase their dividend payouts consistently. The best-case scenario is when a company combines high dividend yields with steady dividend growth\u2014a goal that many businesses have successfully achieved. Given this, let\u2019s take a look at some of the best dividend stocks with extreme dividend yields. Our Methodology: For this list, we used a stock screener and selected dividend stocks with yields ranging from 9% to 23%, as of January 23. Among those stocks, we chose companies that have relatively stable dividend histories, however, a lot of the companies on the list don't have a consistent record of paying dividends due to their exceptionally high yields. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their dividend yields, as recorded on January 23. We also mentioned hedge fund sentiment data for these stocks using Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NYSE:DX) ranks fourth on our list of extreme dividend stocks. The American real estate investment trust company mainly invests in mortgage-backed securities and other various real estate assets. In the past 12 months, the stock has surged modestly by 1.52% as it is still recovering from the challenges it faced during 2022-2023. The difficulties arose from elevated short-term interest rates, which increased interest expenses and put a strain on the trust's book value. However, this dynamic is anticipated to change, as mortgage REITs are expected to gain appeal as sources of passive income in a lower interest rate climate. In the third quarter of 2024, Dynex Capital, Inc. (NYSE:DX) reported an economic return of 7.1% for the third quarter of 2024, emphasizing the expertise and experience it considers essential for successfully navigating the current market conditions.

Though Dynex Capital, Inc. (NYSE:DX) has a high dividend yield of 14.22%, as of January 23, the company's dividend policy remained consistent over the years. It has been paying regular dividends to shareholders since 2008, which makes DX one of the best dividend stocks on our list. Dynex Capital, Inc. (NYSE:DX) was included in 14 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2024, up from 13 in the previous quarter, as per Insider Monkey's database.

In addition, the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cuts benefited the Company's comprehensive income to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2024 by lowering its interest expense related to repurchase agreement borrowings. The Company's interest rate swaps used to hedge its interest rate risk resulted in a net periodic interest benefit of $11.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2024. As the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate rose and mortgage spreads widened during the fourth quarter of 2024, the fair value of the Company's MBS and TBA investments declined $(332.4) million. These losses were more than offset by gains of $337.3 million from U.S. Treasury futures and interest rate swaps. Beginning in November 2024, the Company increased its monthly dividend from $0.13 per common share to $0.15 per common share due to its expected recognition of deferred tax hedge gains of $99.9 million in its distributable REIT taxable income for 2024. Details on the Company's hedging portfolio are discussed in more detail below. The following table summarizes the changes in the Company's financial position during the fourth quarter of 2024: ($s in thousands except per share data) Net Changes in Fair Value Components of Comprehensive Income Common Equity Rollforward Balance as of September 30, 2024 (1) $ 1,031,059 Net interest income $ 6,887 Net periodic interest from interest rate swaps 11,926 Operating expenses (9,246 ) Preferred stock dividends (1,923 ) Changes in fair value: MBS and loans $ (259,826 ) TBAs (72,543 ) U.S. Treasury futures 186,277 Interest rate swaps 151,010 Total net change in fair value 4,918 Comprehensive income to common shareholders 12,562 Capital transactions: Net proceeds from stock issuance (2) 65,462 Common dividends declared (35,647 ) Balance as of December 31, 2024 (1) $ 1,073,436 (1) Amounts represent total shareholders' equity less the aggregate liquidation preference of the Company's preferred stock of $111,500.

(2) Average balance for liabilities is calculated as a simple average of the daily borrowings outstanding during the period. (3) Effective yield is calculated by dividing interest income by the average balance of asset type outstanding during the reporting period. Unscheduled adjustments to premium/discount amortization/accretion, such as for prepayment compensation, are not annualized in this calculation. (4) Financing cost is calculated by dividing annualized interest expense by the total average balance of borrowings outstanding during the period with an assumption of 360 days in a year. (5) CMBS IO (\"Interest only\") includes Agency and non-Agency issued securities. (6) Represents a non-GAAP measure. The Company's effective yield earned on its investment portfolio has continued to increase in recent quarters due to its purchases of higher yielding Agency RMBS. Although the Company's balance of borrowings has increased as a result of using repurchase agreements to partially financing these purchases, its cost of financing as a percentage of average borrowings has continued to decline in recent periods, further benefiting the Company's net interest spread. In addition, the Company has increased its use of interest rate swap agreements, which added a benefit of 0.74% for the fourth quarter of 2024 to the Company's economic net interest spread, a non-GAAP measure. Hedging Portfolio The Company uses certain derivative instruments (\"interest rate hedges\") to hedge exposure to interest rate risk arising from its investment and financing portfolio. The following table provides details on the Company's interest rate hedging portfolio as of the dates indicated: December 31, 2024 September 30, 2024 Derivative Type Notional Amount WAVG Fixed Pay Rate Notional Amount WAVG Fixed Pay Rate ($s in thousands) 10-year U.S. Treasury futures $ (735,000 ) n/a $ (3,850,000 ) n/a 30-year U.S. Treasury futures (516,500 ) n/a (505,000 ) n/a 4-5 year interest rate swaps (1,275,000 ) 3.42% (1,275,000 ) 3.42% 6-7 year interest rate swaps (3,085,000 ) 3.61% (260,000 ) 3.63% 9-10 year interest rate swaps (1,025,000 ) 3.83% \u2014 \u2014 Total $ (6,636,500 ) $ (5,890,000 ) The following table provides detail on the Company's \"gain (loss) on derivatives, net\" recognized in the Company's consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) during the periods indicated: (2) Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, 2024 December 31, 2024 September 30, 2024 Unrealized gain (loss): TBA securities $ (23,158 ) $ (5,953 ) $ (77,042 ) U.

Gains and losses realized upon maturity or termination of derivatives designated as hedges for tax purposes are amortized into the Company's REIT taxable income over the original periods hedged by those derivatives. The benefit expected to be recognized in taxable income for the year ended December 31, 2024 is estimated to be $99.9 million, or $1.41 per average common share outstanding. The Company's remaining estimated net deferred tax hedge gains from its interest rate hedging portfolio was $719.0 million as of December 31, 2024. These hedge gains will be part of the Company's future distribution requirements along with net interest income and other ordinary gains and losses in future periods. The table below provides the projected amortization of the Company's net deferred tax hedge gains that may be recognized as taxable income over the periods indicated, given conditions known as of December 31, 2024; however, uncertainty inherent in the forward interest rate curve makes future realized gains and losses difficult to estimate, and as such, these projections are subject to change for any given period. Projected Period of Recognition for Remaining Tax Hedge Gains, Net December 31, 2024 ($ in thousands) Fiscal year 2025 $ 100,144 Fiscal year 2026 100,420 Fiscal year 2027 95,831 Fiscal year 2028 and thereafter 422,643 $ 719,038 Non-GAAP Financial Measures In evaluating the Company\u2019s financial and operating performance, management considers book value per common share, total economic return to common shareholders, and other operating results presented in accordance with GAAP as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures, which include earnings available for distribution (\"EAD\") to common shareholders (including per common share) and economic net interest income (and the related metric economic net interest spread). Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful to investors because they are viewed by management as a measure of the investment portfolio\u2019s return based on the effective yield of its investments, net of financing costs and, with respect to EAD, net of other normal recurring operating income/expenses. Drop income/loss generated by TBA dollar roll positions, which is included in \"gain (loss) on derivatives instruments, net\" on the Company's consolidated statements of comprehensive income, is included in EAD because management views drop income/loss as the economic equivalent of net interest income on the underlying Agency security from trade date to settlement date. However, drop income/loss does not represent the total realized gain/loss from the Company\u2019s TBA securities. Management also includes net periodic interest from its interest rate swaps, which is included in \"gain (loss) on derivatives instruments, net\", in each of these non-GAAP measures because interest rate swaps are used by the Company to economically hedge the impact of changing interest rates on its borrowing costs from repurchase agreements, and including net periodic interest from interest rate swaps is a helpful indicator of the Company\u2019s total financing cost in addition to GAAP interest expense. Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for GAAP earnings and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs because they may not be calculated in the same manner. Furthermore, though EAD is one of several factors our management considers in determining the appropriate level of distributions to common shareholders, it should not be utilized in isolation, and it is not an accurate indication of the Company\u2019s REIT taxable income or its distribution requirements in accordance with the Tax Code. Reconciliations of each non-GAAP measure to certain GAAP financial measures are provided below.
