[{"text": "Cirrus Logic Inc. (CRUS): Pioneering Audio Innovations with Biometric AI Integration Niloy Chakrabarti Sun, Jan 26, 2025, 7:34 PM 3 min read In This Article: CRUS -1.14% We recently published a list of Top 10 AI News Updates You Should Not Miss . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cirrus Logic, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRUS) stands against other top AI news updates you should not miss. Leading companies across diverse industries, including electronics, IT infrastructure, surveillance, renewable energy, robotics, and cybersecurity, are heavily investing in AI and machine learning to leverage the technology for widescale innovation. In turn, companies are able to reduce operational costs, tackle workforce challenges, and transform client experiences. For instance, in the IT infrastructure space, AI spending is expected to jump to $509.1 billion in 2027 from $175.9 billion in 2023, according to the IDC. The spending on AI platforms is expected to rise as they become increasingly important for business\u2019s digital operations. \u201cHarnessing machine learning can be transformational, but for it to be successful, enterprises need leadership from the top. This means understanding that when machine learning changes one part of the business \u2014 the product mix, for example \u2014 then other parts must also change. This can include everything from marketing and production to supply chain, and even hiring and incentive systems,\u201d said Erik Brynjolfsson, co-founder of Workhelix. Elsewhere, PwC global chairman, Mohamed Kande, during his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos urged people to not be afraid of AI in the workplace but embrace it as a digital colleague. \u201cPeople fear what they don\u2019t understand, so exposing them to the technology, putting in their hands makes a big difference,\u201d Kande said about AI, adding that doing so allows employees to view AI as a \u201cdigital colleague\u2026You don\u2019t fear your colleagues, you partner with them\u2026So we are actually asking people to partner with the technology.\u201d For this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(CRUS) Among the Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks to Buy According to Analysts? Rizwan Siddiqui Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 10:20 PM 3 min read In This Article: CRUS -1.14% We recently published a list of 10 Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks to Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cirrus Logic, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRUS) stands against other undervalued semiconductor stocks to buy according to analysts. Global market intelligence firm IDC, in its most recent report, projected a 15% growth for the global semiconductor market in 2025, driven by the relentless rise in demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC). According to their analysts, this surge will be fueled by forthcoming upgrades in key application markets, notably cloud data centers. Further emphasizing the industry\u2019s promising growth outlook, Nicolas Gaudois, head of Asia-Pacific technology research at UBS, stated in a recent CNBC interview that AI-compute will continue to underpin growth in 2025. He observed: \u201cThe 21% growth in the semiconductor market was mostly driven by AI-compute demand while non-AI growth actually declined. In 2025, AI would remain the growth driver with 40% growth but we expect non-AI portion to also grow by 17% due to several factors such as autos and industrial markets growth improving, restocking (customers buying for their inventories) in those markets and also increase in semiconductor content in devices to support edge (on-device) AI.\u201d Nicolas also suggested that GPU chipmakers and foundries will remain the main beneficiaries of AI demand and will make the most money from it. With the semiconductor space ripe for further growth, we have picked 10 semiconductor stocks that are undervalued and are best placed to benefit from this growth. Our Methodology To identify the 10 undervalued semiconductor stocks, we carried out thorough research and used stock screeners to compile a list of U.S.-listed companies. Our criteria included a market capitalization of over $2 billion, an expected share price upside of at least 10%, and a Forward PE ratio below 30x. Ultimately, the stocks were ranked in ascending order of their upside potential. These stocks are also popular among elite hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ( see more details here ). Is Cirrus Logic, Inc. (CRUS) Undervalued Semiconductor Stock to Buy According to Analysts? A technician in a lab coat inspecting a semiconductor processor on a microscope.

The company also has a strong intellectual property portfolio with about 3,940 pending and issued patents worldwide underpinning its competitive positioning. Building on its audio solutions, Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS) recently announced a collaboration with Intel to launch a reference design based on the new Intel Core Ultra processors (series 2) with Cirrus Logic\u2019s high-quality audio solutions. The collaboration will be a win-win for both companies as this will advance Intel\u2019s PC audio technology, delivering enhanced sound quality, low power consumption, and flexible audio options for a wide range of PCs. Overall, CRUS ranks 3rd on our list of undervalued semiconductor stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of CRUS to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

David Feaster; Analyst; Raymond James & Associates Presentation Operator Good day and welcome to the Pacific Premier Bancorp fourth-quarter 2024 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Gardner, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead. Steven Gardner Great. Thank you, Gary. Good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today. As you're all aware, we released our earnings report for the fourth quarter of 2024. Earlier this morning, we have also published an updated investor presentation with additional information and disclosures on our financial results. If you have not done so already, we encourage you to visit our Investor Relations website to download a copy of the presentation and related materials. I note that our earnings release and investor presentation include a Safe Harbor statement relative to forward-looking comments. I encourage each of you to carefully read that statement on today's call. I'll walk through some of the notable items related to our fourth-quarter performance. Ron Nicolas, our CFO, will also review a few of the details surrounding our financial results and then we will open up the call to questions. I want to take a moment to discuss the events currently unfolding here in Southern California. Our hearts go out to everyone affected by the devastating California wildfires, including our colleagues, clients and neighbors in the Los Angeles area. We stand ready to support our community's needs during this challenging time and in future rebuilding efforts. As always, we remain committed to serving as both a financial partner and a source of strength for the communities we proudly call home. In response, Pacific Premier will launch several initiatives in consumer and commercial lending with expanded products and services to support the displaced homeowners and businesses with these enhanced product offerings. Our goal is to create an efficient streamlined process for those affected with the intention to provide the necessary financial support as soon as possible. Our restoration efforts begin. We will be there as a primary capital provider to the builders, contractors and related businesses as part of our rebuild LA initiatives. Our teams are continuing to assess the direct and indirect impact of the wildfires on our clients' residents as well as their business of those clients personally affected by the fires. The preliminary indications are that approximately four loans totaling $8 million have sustained some level of damage. However, of those loans, $5 million reflects a single credit that is well collateralized and secured by multiple properties. We are closely monitoring the ongoing situation and corresponding impacts on our clients and we stand ready to work with those in need over the coming weeks and months. Looking now at the results, our team delivered a solid fourth quarter closing the year in a strong financial position, we generated earnings per share of $0.35 a return on average assets of 75 basis points and a return on tangible common equity of 7.2%. Our performance throughout 2024 highlighted the resiliency of our organization and the strength of our relationship-based business model. This success was a testament to the outstanding business development efforts of our entire team, attracting new small business and middle market clients, deepening existing relationships and driving new customers to the bank. I'll note that late in the fourth quarter. The OCC approved our application to convert from a California-chartered bank to a national banking association. This change in charter better aligns our West Coast business banking model that is supplemented by our complementary national lines of business amidst a more favorable economic outlook. Borrower sentiment improved during the quarter which drove a positive shift in our funding mix, effectively reducing higher cost deposits by $163 million while increasing lower cost transaction deposits by $146 million. These encouraging trends allowed us to reinvest excess liquidity into loans and short term us treasuries enhancing our overall balance sheet position. While the absolute level of short-term rates remain somewhat elevated, we made progress in lowering our funding costs as cost of funds decreased 9 basis points to 1.88% and our spot deposit costs at year end declined 8 basis points to 1.72%. Overall, our cost of deposits remains low on a relative basis. When compared to our peers as such, we will take a balanced approach to funding loan growth while driving pricing down further, all of which will likely be impacted by the timing and magnitude of potential Fed moves with the Federal Reserve having initiated interest rate cuts in September coupled with the resolution of preelection uncertainty, we observed growing optimism among our clients about the future. These positive trends provide us with renewed confidence for stronger organic originations in commercial and business loans as well as high quality opportunities in construction, multifamily and CRE our loan portfolio increased slightly during the quarter driven by increased C&I and consumer loans during the fourth quarter. New origination activity accelerated with new loan commitments totaling $316 million. Our highest level since the third quarter of 2022 as our loan pipelines ramp up and our teams build on the momentum established in the fourth quarter. We will continue to complement organic loan growth with strategic loan purchases in participations in lines of business where we have established expertise C&I loans we acquired are predominantly comprised of investment grade credits and not leverage loans. We may modestly add to this portfolio to supplement existing originations but expect them to make up a relatively small portion of our overall loan production in the coming quarters. Prudent risk management continues to remain a priority demonstrated by our robust capital ratios which increased from September 30. Our tangible common equity ratio and total risk-based capital ratio increased to 11.92%, 17.05%, and 20.28% respectively. At year end on a year-over-year basis, our total risk-based capital ratio increased nearly 300 basis points and all our capital ratios continue to rank near the top of the KBW regional banking index. As we move into 2025, our strong momentum and robust capital levels position us well to adopt a more constructive approach in driving new business through loan and deposit growth. Customer deposit trends during the quarter were positive as we saw an increase in lower cost deposits. We are cautiously optimistic that increased business and commercial real estate activity will lead to additional deposit growth as we move through the year. Looking ahead, our team of bankers are laser focused on expanding both new and existing loan and deposit relationships enabling us to pursue attractive risk adjusted opportunities to drive higher levels of net interest income and increased earnings power. As of December 31, our loan-to-deposit ratio was 83.3%, providing us with ample liquidity to fund our growth objectives. Regarding pricing, we will remain disciplined but our ability to make immediate adjustments will be somewhat dependent on how the interest rate outlook unfolds. Ron will provide additional detail in his comments regarding our forward assumptions within our full year guidance. Our longstanding philosophy emphasizes that franchise value is built through deep client relationships as evidenced by our strong deposit base. It is important to note that our average client relationship has a tenure of over 13 years. As I discussed during our last call, we saw the benefit from the strategic actions we took during the summer to positively impact loan production. We have improved our competitive position in the market which is translated into a nice pickup in new loan activity that carried an attractive weighted average rate on new originations of 6.92%. The team is successfully managing existing portfolio balances ahead of scheduled loan maturities and interest rate resets. As a result, we saw $95 million in multifamily production for existing customers having moved past key factors that previously fueled broader uncertainty. We anticipate expanding our loan production efforts consistent with our ability to attract low-cost deposits in the coming quarters. We expect organic originations to meet or exceed the level of prepayments and payoffs. Asset quality results remained strong as nonperforming loans decreased $11 million to $28 million and total delinquencies fell to $2.6 million or 0.02% of loans. These favorable asset quality results represent our effective approach to credit risk management demonstrated throughout our history and will continue to benefit us and our stakeholders with that. I'll turn the call over to Ron to provide a few more details on our fourth-quarter financial results. Story Continues Ronald Nicolas Thanks, Steve, and good morning. For comparison purposes, my comments today are on a linked quarter basis, unless otherwise noted. Let's begin with the quarter's results. For the fourth quarter, we recorded net income of $33.9 million or $0.35 per share. We had total revenue of $144.5 million and noninterest expense was $100.7 million, which translated to an efficiency ratio of 67.8% and preprovision net revenue of $43.8 million. The quarter's results were influenced by the sizable churn of the loan portfolio which saw a significant runoff early in the quarter, offset comparatively by stronger organic loan originations and supplemented by loan purchases in the back half of the quarter. Taking a closer look at the income statement, net interest income of $124.5 million came in at the high end of our third quarter guidance as growth in nonmaturity deposits resulted in a favorable funding mix shift and lower average funding costs. Our noninterest margin net interest margin narrowed 14 basis points to 3.02%. As average earning asset yields declined to 4.74%. Due to lower swap income, lower rates on floating rate, earning assets and paydowns and payoffs of higher yielding loans partially offset by lower cost of funds which decrease nine basis points to 1.88%. Our cost of deposits decreased to 1.79% and average nonmaturity deposit costs were flat at 1.28% with the spot cost of nonmaturity deposits decreasing to 1.24%. Our SOFR-based swap portfolio contributed 10 basis points to the net interest margin and we have $300 million remaining of notional swaps that matured during the first half of 2026. With our current rate expectations for two fed rate cuts in 2025, we anticipate approximately $2 million to $3 million of swap income for the first quarter. Average loan yields decreased to 5.13% due to lower rates on floating rate loans and combined prepayments carrying an average coupon rate of 7.23%. While we fully offset the elevated level of prepayments with new organic originations at an average rate of 6.92% and loan purchases that carried an average rate of 6.54%. The fundings occurred later in the quarter. This dynamic along with the immediate repricing of floating rate loans and swaps had a pronounced effect on the fourth quarter. Average loan yields. It's important to note that the fourth quarter total end of period weighted average interest rate on loans excluding fees, discounts, and swaps decreased only 4 basis points to 4.78%. As highlighted in our investor presentation. We anticipate 125 basis points rate cut in March and 125 basis points cut in September and expect full year net interest income to be in the $500 million to $525 million range. Noninterest income increased to $20 million as a result of higher investment income of $1.1 million for the full year 2025. We expect our total noninterest income to be in the range of $80 million to $85 million. Noninterest expense decreased $1 million to $100.7 million attributable to a $3 million decrease in compensation expense as well as lower facilities and deposit costs partially offset by $4.1 million in higher legal and professional services. From a staffing perspective, we ended the quarter relatively flat with a headcount of 1,325 compared with 1,328 as of September 30. Our expectations for full year 2025 are for noninterest expense to be in the range of $405 million to $415 million. As we continue to diligently manage our operating expense, we had a provision recapture of $814,000 compared to $486,000 of provision expense in the prior quarter, commensurate with our loan portfolio mix shift and our current asset quality profile. As Steve noted, asset quality continues to trend favorably as we proactively manage our credit risk turning now to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter at $17.9 billion in total assets, consistent with the level at September 30. As we deployed excess cash into loans and AFL securities, total loans held for investment were flat from the prior quarter at $12 million as increases in C&I and single family residential loans offset reductions in CRE multifamily and construction loan balances during the fourth quarter, new origination activity increased as new loan commitments totaled $316 million and fundings totaled $193.8 million. In addition to organic loan growth, we purchased $401.3 million of investment grade C&I loans and $116.3 million of single family residential loans. Our C&I lines of credit outstanding as of December 31st were $536.8 million and the utilization rate was 33.5% compared with $743.1 million outstanding and a utilization rate of 40.1% at September 30. I'll note the elevated level of prepayments and decreased line utilizations seen in the fourth quarter was impacted by the planned exit of the large commercial relationship in early October. Looking ahead, our loan pipelines are building and we anticipate low- to mid-single-digit loan growth in 2025. As Steve noted, we will continue to supplement organic loan originations with loan purchases to meet and exceed runoff. Total deposits were $14.5 billion, a decrease of $17.2 million from the prior quarter. Nonmaturity deposits increased $145.8 million to $12.4 billion and the level of nonmaturity deposits increased to 85.4% of total deposits with noninterest bearing deposits remaining steady at 32%. The growth in non-maturity deposits coupled with a deliberate reduction in higher cost time deposits resulted in an overall cost of deposits of 1.79%. We saw our cash position trend more toward our historical levels ending the quarter at $610.6 million. The remix of our balance sheet reflects the stability in our deposit base and moving forward. We anticipate our cash position will remain at this lower level. The securities portfolio increased $365.1 million to $3.5 billion. And the average yield on our investment portfolio was 3.65%. During the quarter, we purchased $705 million of AFS securities consisting almost entirely of short-term treasuries with a weighted average yield of 4.13%. From a liquidity perspective, we enter 2025 in a strong position with $610.6 million of cash on hand. A loan-to-deposit ratio of 83%, $9 billion of total available unused borrowing capacity, and $1.1 billion of scheduled cash flow coming back from our investment portfolio. The combination of solid earnings stable overall balance sheet size and a favorable loan mix shift, strengthen our capital ratios with all ratios increasing over the prior quarter. Our tangible common equity ratio increased 9 basis points to 11.92% and our tangible book value per share increased $0.75 year over year to $20.97. Lastly from an asset quality standpoint, we continue to see improvement overall in our asset quality numbers as nonperforming loans decreased $11.1 million to $28 million or 0.23% of loans total delinquency decreased six basis points to 0.02% and classified loans decreased 12 basis points to 0.88% of total loans. Our ACL balance and ACL coverage ratio remained at healthy levels totaling $178.2 million. And our coverage ratio came in at 1.48% compared to 1.45% at December 31, 2023. Our total loss absorption which includes the fair value discount on loans acquired through acquisitions finished the quarter at 1.75%. With that, I'll turn the call back to Steve. Steven Gardner Great. Thanks, Ron, and I'll wrap up with a few comments as we move into the new year with the new administration and a more encouraging outlook. We have an increased confidence to grow the balance sheet in what is expected to be a more business friendly environment for our clients. The prospects of potential deregulation leading to increased productivity is expected to have a meaningful impact on our ability to generate new loan production as we work to gain market share in terms of capital allocation in the near term. We are committed to maintaining our dividend at the current level and while earnings may be muted during the early part of 2025 our focus is to redeploy excess liquidity into more loans to grow and generate further earnings power. Moreover, we begin this year with good momentum and high levels of capital with a steadfast focus on reinvesting in the business to support organic growth. We believe we are entering a more constructive environment that should provide greater growth opportunities and better demand for credit. We have significant optionality to capitalize on any attractive opportunities that may arise. That said, as always, we are exploring a multitude of capital deployment options to act opportunistically and maximize shareholder value which could include select loan purchases and participations to complement organic growth. Further reduction of higher cost funding sources including time deposits and the repayment of subordinated debt, strategic balance sheet restructurings in the form of exiting lower yielding CRE loans or securities or share repurchases as we have roughly $100 million of capacity. Under our current authorization the M&A front, we remain open to a broad range of strategic transactions that will maximize long term value for our shareholders. We firmly believe in the benefits of scale and that is best achieved through effectively structured M&A agreements. Thus, we remain actively engaged in pursuing attractive partners and remain agnostic to which side of a transaction we are on behalf of the board of directors and our entire executive leadership team. I want to thank every one of our colleagues for their dedication to Pacific Premier that concludes our prepared remarks and we would be happy to answer any questions. Gary, please open up the call for questions. Question and Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions) Matthew Clark, Piper Sandler. Matthew Clark Hey. Good morning, everyone. Steven Gardner Morning, Matthew. Matthew Clark Just a few quick ones around the margin. If you had the average margin the month of December and then kind of thoughts on the near-term margin here in 1Q and where you might -- where you think you might exit 2025 given your growth prospects and what you're doing on the funding side. Ronald Nicolas Hey, Matthew. Our December net interest margin was 3.03%. So 3.03%, and I would anticipate that our first-quarter margin is going to be right around where we're at now, at least that's what we're thinking. As we sit here today, we had some -- obviously some positive things come about with lower funding costs. But as we talked a little bit about, we saw some higher yielding loans prepay off earlier in the quarter. But then we got some -- I think we've got some yield back here in the latter part with these, with the originations and some of these purchases. So kind of net net, we're kind of thinking it's going to be right around this level for the first quarter. And then as we move throughout 2025, we'll be able to improve on both sides of that equation, Matthew. Matthew Clark Okay. Fair enough. And then on the comp expense, it looks like there was a reversal of compa crus. Can you just quantify how much that was and kind of what we should anticipate for merit increases in 1Q? Ronald Nicolas There was a few diams that happened here in the fourth quarter. We had just overall lower staffing through the entire quarter. I think we finished the second quarter, about 350 people in our third quarter came down and then we stayed pretty much flat. So that gave rise to lower overall incentives for the full year if you will lower benefit costs, lower compensation costs. So we had a little bit of a windfall in that respect here in the fourth quarter. The first quarter, our budget's around 3%. We'll probably see a couple of million dollars there in increasing as well as with the payroll taxes and then we'll get back to a more normalized run rate. Matthew Clark Okay, great. And then last one for me just on the loan purchases. Saw the types of things you purchased, but can you just give us some more color on what you would like to purchase on the margin kind of incremental in terms of yield and type of assets? Steven Gardner Sure. Again, we use this tactically to supplement the production and is that the team ramps up further and depending upon market conditions. We continue to look to acquire non-CRE although we're not completely opposed to CRE purchases as long as it met our risk-adjusted return thresholds structure price and the like. So we'll continue to look at a variety of product types. But again, it's within that spectrum of where our expertise lies in C&I commercial real estate and the like. Matthew Clark Great. Thank you. Operator Gary Tenner, DA Davidson. Gary Tenner Thanks, good morning. On the topic of being kind of not anti-CRE, do you talk about how, if your view on that changed at all here, you've got your CRE concentration ratio, just to tick over 300 right now. The first time you've been down to that level since the acquisition a few years ago. So has that -- does getting to that level materially change your appetite or view of that segment? Steven Gardner No, it doesn't materially change it. But I think that one we wanted to work that down over time historically, we have done that more rapidly following acquisitions, just principally because our primary focus is on banking, small businesses, middle market clients. And that typically led to much greater activity on the C&I side. And then certainly just the dynamics that occurred with the pandemic postop acquisition and just the high quality nature of our business clients, we just saw rapid paydowns in those areas. And in given our expertise in the multifamily, that is what we originated during that period of time, but we certainly wanted to bring that concentration down. And certainly there were a lot of uncertainties over the last couple of years on how CRE would perform. I think some of those have abated but not fully. And, and that's really stemming from what we saw with the Fed beginning to remove the tightness in fed funds rate last year with the hunter basis points decline. We'll see where that goes from here. But in addition to that, we were pretty confident in the performance of our own loan portfolio and we've certainly seen that very strong asset quality metrics across the board, just all of that adds up and, and we're just a bit more constructive here today. We're willing to add a little bit to it. But we certainly rather we -- we're not going to be growing it significantly or materially. Gary Tenner I appreciate the thoughts there and then as it relates to kind of the rebuilding of in the wake of the wildfires. Do you think that as we move to the back half of the year you actually see a tangible benefit to growth? I've had some people suggest it could be an extended period of time until there's even building permits issued as far as the regal and just because of the amount of cleanup that has to be done. What are the thoughts around that? Steven Gardner Yeah. No, I think that the cleanup is going to be significant. And just certainly the tightness in the construction trades and the industry overall right now finding those individuals. But I think it's encouraging hearing the policymakers, political leaders at the local and state level seeming to be very committed to temporarily suspending or removing a lot of this red tape that has existed for a long period of time that frankly has led to this underbuilding and underdevelopment of housing in the state and in that, that will hopefully benefit here those individuals that have been impacted. So we'll see how things evolve here. And I think that we are in a very unique position with our capital levels, with our knowledge experience on the construction side, banking, businesses and consumers and again, right within our own neighborhood that we expect to be very active in helping our communities rebuild Gary Tenner Great, thanks. And Ron, just a quick bookkeeping question. Can you give us the total ACL including the loans for unfunded commitments at your end? Ronald Nicolas I don't have that off the top of my head here, Gary. Let me get back to you on that. Gary Tenner Okay, thank you. Operator Chris McGratty, KBW. Chris McGratty Great. Do kind of a two-part question about the effects of what happened in November in the election. Maybe a comment on the increased optimism, business friendly you touched upon your prepared remarks and I've got a follow-up on that. Thanks. Steven Gardner Sure. No, I think that broadly, the increased level of optimism from business owners were a combination of factors. Again, the Fed beginning to reduce the Fed funds rate, I think was a piece of that to just getting the election behind us and the smooth peaceful transfer of power was important and then I think widely expected is just a more constructive, business friendly environment that clients are sensing in and where they have been reluctant to invest. I think they're just -- all of those factors have played into a bit more of an optimistic viewpoint on their outlook and that's what they're indicating to us and that's what we're certainly sensing from the conversations that we're having with business owners and investors. Chris McGratty That's great. Thank you. And my follow-up, maybe a comment on how M&A conversations have evolved in the last, maybe 90 days if there's been any change, given bank stocks are working a little bit more and there is a growing optimism for the economy and deregulation. Steven Gardner Yeah, I think certainly, conversations have picked up a little bit. Given that I think we all widely expect that the muted levels of M&A we've seen over the last couple of years that, that as the regulators seem to become a bit more open to transactions and widely expected that they could move through the process a bit more smoothly. That's created also a level of optimism and we are actively pursuing opportunities. Chris McGratty That's great. Thank you. Operator Andrew Terrell, Stephens. Andrew Terrell Hey, good morning. Ron, I got to ask him the just the margin quickly. I think you said you were expecting $2 million to $3 million of swap income in the first quarter. Can you just remind us how much you recognize in the fourth quarter? Ronald Nicolas About $4 million was recognized in the fourth quarter, Andrew. Andrew Terrell Okay. And then I wanted to ask on some of the purchase strategy for the C&I loans. I think your C&I book goes up $170 million or so this quarter. Was any of that (inaudible) and can you just quantify, I might have missed it, how much of the C&I was purchased, how much of the single family was purchased this quarter? Steven Gardner I don't have the exact amounts here on me. I mean, there's certainly a -- Ron may have -- there are some (inaudible) in there in other loan types that we purchased and/or participated in as we mentioned, predominantly investment quality assets. Ronald Nicolas Andrew, it was $400 million the C&I side and about [115] round numbers on the SFR. Andrew Terrell Got it. Okay. And I wanted to ask on just back on the deposits. Quickly, I think you mentioned that the spot rate 1.72% at year end on total deposits. I guess I'm just curious, does that 1.72% -- do you feel like there's more room to go in terms of repricing customer deposits, absent any future rate decreases here kind of the first half of the year? Or is that 1.72% really incorporate kind of all the actions you took post the prior Fed meetings? Steven Gardner No, we think there's some opportunity to continue to push deposit costs down as we grow quality relationships that lead to low-cost transaction accounts. Ronald Nicolas Yeah, we're seeing most of the pricing benefit on the time deposits. We have seen some on the transaction or the nonmaturity deposits. Our deposit beta overall is running around 35% to 40% but we're seeing higher on that time than we are on the nonmaturity. Although albeit -- again, so there's some opportunities, some mixed opportunity as Steve indicated. But obviously we'll see how it plays out with the Fed and our cost of course, is already, lower than the average, relatively speaking. So we have a little bit of room to give with the Fed funds lowering, whereas some folks who are right, their cost of deposits being much closer to much higher, they've immediately started to take advantage of those initial Fed cuts, Andrew. Andrew Terrell Okay. That makes sense. If I could sneak one more in just on the deposit expense in the OpEx line. There was a little bit of moderation this quarter, but I think my sense was that a lot of these were -- this was pretty rate sensitive and might come down more than it did. I'm just curious, for the conversations you're having with clients around ECR rate and the deposit operating expense you're paying it, does that feel more competitive as you have those conversations than your more traditional clients? Steven Gardner I mean, generally, there's a good chunk of that is related to our community association, ho a banking team and over the last couple of years we've seen, and some -- just a crazy frankly pricing by some folks that indicate to us at least a level of desperation and it's just never been a game that we would play or enter, we focused on long term and keeping our deposit costs low. But at the same time remaining competitive where we can, so we'll see as we move through the year what options we have there to push some of those costs down. Andrew Terrell Okay. Thank you for taking the questions. Operator David Feaster, Raymond James. David Feaster Hi, good morning, everybody. Just starting on the loan side, it seems like if I'm hearing you correctly, we're expecting organically to at least keep things stable and supplement the growth with full purchases to kind of be the driver of growth. I guess, what do you think it'll take to get organic growth to support that low- to mid-single-digit pace of growth that you were talking about and maybe alleviate the need for purchases or participations? Do you have the team in place to do that? Are you interested in additional hires to maybe to get where you're trying to go? Steven Gardner No, we have the team in place and I think it's look as, we really became obviously, our market position improved. We did that from conscientiously in during the summer. And so the pipeline began to build from that point. And so we're still to an extent, a little bit in the early stages. But we're encouraged by how engaged and the level of activity that we're seeing from our bankers and the opportunities that they're coming across. So what we'll see, it somewhat depends on the level of paydowns and payoffs that we see in the portfolio. And I fully expect again depending upon market conditions. But within the next couple of quarters that the team should be funding, we should be originating the product ourselves. And we'll just tactically utilize loan purchases participations here along the way. David Feaster Okay. Terrific. And then just curious, what are you seeing on the new loan yield front? It seems like you're increasingly willing to compete on rate to drive growth, still getting really attractive yields, pushing 7% and yields held up pretty well despite Fed cuts. I'm just curious looking forward, how do you think about the loan yields and repricing, taking into consider kind of the fixed rate or pricing that you got on the book coming up this year and especially in 2026 and 2027? You got the swap headwind gone. So I'm just kind of curious how you think about the pace of yield improvement, given some of these dynamics. Steven Gardner I think it remains to be seen what does the Fed do one way or the other. But right now, the yield on the new originations is pretty attractive in the high sixes and same thing with some of the product that, that we purchased. So we're pretty encouraged. Also, we have a chunk of the multifamily and CRE that's repricing here this year and hopefully we can retain much of that. We've seen an unusual dynamic here for the last couple of years. As soon as those loans had moved to that adjustable rate, much higher borrowers were just paying us off with all cash or sometimes less extent, moving to another institution to finance it. So I think we're encouraged here more so than we have been in the past about the ability to reprice the loan portfolio up over time. That's not going to happen overnight, but we're fairly constructive at this point. David Feaster Okay. That's great. And then just -- you touched on some of the capital priorities, notably the M&A side. Just curious kind of how you think about obviously dividends, maintaining the dividends top priority that some organic growth on the horizon, how do you think about buybacks or additional restructurings? Steven Gardner I mean, I think as I mentioned that we're looking at a multitude of options, we were regularly assessing it. It comes with impacts both positive and negative if you will and you've got to take all of those into consideration and then you're making assumptions about the future, the ability to grow organically to redeploy that liquidity and the like. So we'll continue to reassess it and as I mentioned, we include that in the stock buybacks as well. David Feaster Right. Thanks, everybody. Operator Matthew Clark, Piper Sandler. Matthew Clark Yeah, thanks. Just on a sub deck. Can you remind us when that reprices and whether or not you would either refinance that or just pay it off? I mean, that's the only -- those are the only borrowings you have left on the balance sheet. Steven Gardner That's correct. I mean, one of them repriced last year or moved to adjustable rate. The other one I believe in June, right? That is correct. Yeah, look, we're looking at that as well. Considering refinancing it, considering paying it off, considering leaving in place all of those various options we're looking at modeling and discussing internally. Matthew Clark Okay, thank you. Operator This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Steven Gardner for any closing remarks. Steven Gardner Great. Thank you, Gary, and thank you all for joining us today. Operator The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Stock? Zacks Equity Research Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 6:09 PM 4 min read Nova Ltd. NVMI shares have soared 71.6% over the past year, outperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector\u2019s return of 27.8%. Over the same time frame, it also outperformed the Electronics - Semiconductors industry and its peers, including Alpha Omega and Semiconductor AOSL, Cirrus Logic CRUS and Navitas Semiconductor NVTS. In the trailing 12 months, shares of AOSL and CRUS have rallied 47.7% and 23.5%, respectively, while NVTS shares have plunged 49.8%. The industry has appreciated 56.8% in the past year. With this outperformance, investors may be wondering whether to buy, hold or sell NVMI stock. Nova Ltd. Price and Consensus Nova Ltd. Price and Consensus Nova Ltd. price-consensus-chart | Nova Ltd. Quote Nova\u2019s Robust Financial and Market Performance Nova\u2019s financial performance underscores its solid position in the semiconductor market. In the third quarter of 2024, the company reported record revenues of $179 million, up 39% year over year, and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $1.74, up 41% from the year-ago quarter. Both top and bottom lines surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimates as well. Nova\u2019s outperformance is driven by its leadership in critical technologies, including optical and chemical metrology, which are essential for advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes. The company\u2019s innovative offerings, such as the VeraFlex IV platform and PRISM 2, are well-aligned with the industry\u2019s transition to advanced nodes, artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, and hybrid bonding, ensuring strong demand for its solutions. Analysts are optimistic about Nova\u2019s growth prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues and earnings depict a year-over-year increase of 19.5% and 12.9%, respectively. NVMI has surpassed the consensus mark for earnings in the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 10.1%. Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar. Nova\u2019s Strategic Positioning in High-Growth Markets Nova\u2019s exposure to cutting-edge trends like gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, advanced packaging and backside power delivery positions it at the forefront of semiconductor innovation. The adoption of GAA technology, expected to increase process complexity by 30%, presents a lucrative opportunity for Nova. The company projects $500 million in cumulative revenues from GAA processes by 2026, reinforcing its long-term growth prospects. NVMI is capitalizing on the semiconductor industry\u2019s structural growth, driven by AI, high-performance computing, and advanced memory requirements. Its advanced packaging solutions, critical for AI and high-bandwidth memory, are seeing accelerated adoption as customers upgrade their manufacturing capabilities to meet increasing demand. The company\u2019s strong research & development (R&D) investments further enhance its technological edge. Nova\u2019s leadership in both dimensional and chemical metrology ensures its relevance as manufacturing complexity increases, making it a preferred partner for top-tier semiconductor manufacturers. Story Continues Short-Term Challenges for Nova Despite the strengths, Nova grappled with a few challenges. The company\u2019s reliance on the Chinese market, while previously a strength, has become a growing risk due to geopolitical tensions between the United States and China. China contributed about 36% of the company\u2019s total sales in 2023. However, escalating trade tensions and potential export restrictions on semiconductor technologies to China could severely hinder Nova\u2019s ability to maintain these revenues. The global semiconductor supply chain remains highly susceptible to geopolitical disruptions, and Nova's heavy exposure to China amplifies this risk. Investors should weigh this uncertainty heavily when considering whether to hold or sell the stock, as any future restrictions could be a major drag on Nova's revenues. Moreover, NVMI's non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to reach $50 million in the fourth quarter, driven by ongoing investments in R&D. This reflects a 44.5% increase from the year-ago quarter and a 5.3% rise from the previous quarter. Rising costs, paired with margin pressures, may impact the company's bottom line, making it harder to sustain profitability levels in the future. Zacks Rank NVMI currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that existing investors should hold the stock while new buyers should wait for a better entry point into the stock.

"Earnings Season Scorecard and Analyst Reports for Walmart, Marvell Technology & Others Sheraz Mian Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 11:13 PM 8 min read In This Article: ^GSPC -0.76% WMT +1.41% MRVL +0.62% APH -0.93% KMI +1.43% Tuesday, January 21, 2025 Today's Research Daily features the real-time scorecard for the ongoing Q4 earnings season and new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Walmart Inc. (WMT), Marvell Technology, Inc. (MRVL) and Amphenol Corporation (APH).\u00a0 These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.

You can read today's AWS here >>> Pre-Markets Start Trading in the Green Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard Including this morning's releases, we now have Q4 results from 48 S&P 500 members. Total earnings for these 48 index members are up +21.3% from the same period last year on +6.8% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 70.8% beating revenue estimates. This is a notably better showing relative to what we have seen from this group of 48 S&P 500 members in other recent periods, both in terms of the growth pace as well as beats proportions. Looking at Q4 as a whole, combining the actual results from the 48 index members with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.6% on +4.8% higher revenues. For full-year 2025, the expectation is for S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +13.7% on +5.4% higher revenues. This will be the first time since 2018 when all 16 Zacks sectors are expected to enjoy posiitve earnings growth, with 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to have double-digit earnings growth. Our earnings analysis reflects bottom-up expectations, with the Zacks Consensus estimates for each S&P 500 member aggregted to the respective sector and index level. In terms of the 'index-level EPS', the +13.7% aggregate earnings growth in 2025 works out to $263.75 per 'index share'. This compares to the top-down consensus of sell-side strategists of $274.50, with a range of $285 per share on the high side and $270 on the low side. What this shows you is that the Zacks bottom-up estimate for 2025 earnings is below even the lower end of the top-down consensus. Story Continues For more details about the ongoing Q4 earnings season and evolving expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here >>>> Q4 Earnings Season Kicks-off Strong Today's Featured Research Reports Walmart shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry over the past year (+74% vs. +68.4%). The company is benefiting from its diverse business model that spans multiple segments, channels and formats. The company's strong omnichannel strategy has boosted traffic across physical stores and digital platforms. Its emphasis on improving delivery services has been successful, contributing to steady grocery market share gains. Upsides like these, along with growth in the advertising business, fueled third-quarter fiscal 2025 results, wherein the top and bottom lines grew year over year, and e-commerce sales surged. However, Walmart is experiencing adverse currency movements and margin pressures from shifts in product mix. While raising its fiscal 2025 guidance, the company\u2019s implied fourth-quarter view for revenues and operating income reflects a slowdown from the reported third-quarter figures. (You can read the full research report on Walmart here >>> ) Shares of Marvell Technology have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry over the past year (+93.3% vs. +58.5%). The company is benefiting from the strong demand environment across the data center end market. In Q3, its data center end market revenues increased 98% year over year and 25% sequentially, propelled by strong revenue growth across artificial intelligence (AI)-driven demand for PAM products and ZR electro-optics. Completion of inventory digestions is likely to aid growth across the enterprise networking and carrier infrastructure end markets. However, weakening consumer spending amid the protracted high inflationary conditions and still-high interest rates is likely to hurt its sales across the Consumer segment. Enterprises are postponing their large IT spending plans amid the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. This is likely to hurt its performance in the near term. (You can read the full research report on Marvell Technology here >>> ) Amphenol shares have gained +4% over the past six months against the Zacks Electronics - Connectors industry\u2019s gain of +5.2%. The company is benefiting from its strong portfolio of solutions, including high-technology interconnect products. Expanding spending on both current and next-generation defense technologies bodes well for APH\u2019s top-line growth. Apart from Defense, Amphenol\u2019s prospects ride on strong demand for its solutions across Commercial Air, Industrial, and Mobile devices. APH expects sales in the defense market to increase moderately on a sequential basis. For 2024, it expects mid-teens increase in sales from the Defense market. Amphenol\u2019s diversified business model lowers the volatility of individual end markets and geographies. Strong cash flow generating ability is noteworthy. Amphenol expects to deliver strong cash flow despite slight rise in capital expenditure.

(KMI) and LPL Financial Holdings Inc. (LPLA). Director of Research Sheraz Mian Note: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

Strong Portfolio Buoys Cirrus Logic (CRUS) Amid High Costs Per the Zacks analyst, steady growth in high-performance mixed-signal and audio segments is boosting Cirrus Logic's performance. Rising costs are likely to put pressure on its margins.

Zacks Equity Research Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 7:46 PM 4 min read In This Article: SKYT -5.13% SkyWater Technology SKYT shares have surged 50.9% over the past six-month period, outperforming the Zacks\u00a0 Electronics - Semiconductors industry and the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s appreciation of 11.9% and 1.1%, respectively. Over the same time frame, it outperformed its industry peers, including Broadcom AVGO and Cirrus Logic CRUS. For the past six months, shares of SKYT have gained 30.9%, while shares of CRUS have lost 27.7%. For investors, the question now is whether the stock has more room to run or if it\u2019s time to cash in. Given SkyWater\u2019s robust long-term potential and its strategic moves, holding the stock appears to be the prudent choice. SkyWater Technology, Inc. Price and Consensus SkyWater Technology, Inc. Price and Consensus SkyWater Technology, Inc. price-consensus-chart | SkyWater Technology, Inc. Quote Long-Term Partnerships Bolster SKYT\u2019s Growth SkyWater Technology s leading the way in customer partnerships by laying a solid basis for the expansion of its commercial wafer services business, which has great potential for advanced computing and thermal imaging platforms in addition to advanced biomedical. SkyWater Technology and Quantum-Si Incorporated QSI, the protein sequencing company, announced that they will work together to deepen their partnership to support the development of Proteus, QSI's next-generation platform that will revolutionize proteomic research. The enlarged partnership will create the Proteus consumable that will allow for simultaneous, highly accurate large-factor protein sequencing. The partnership, which combines Quantum-Si's biotechnology expertise with SkyWater's Technology as a Service manufacturing capability, has the potential to significantly advance proteomics and protein sequencing. SkyWater Technology makes a bold move by collaborating with Multibeam Corp., a first-of-a-kind Multicolumn E-Beam Lithography (MEBL) system for volume production. MEBL gives SKYT's customers access to a number of new production capabilities, such as full wafer patterning to support focal plane read-out ICs and other large format die types and secure chip ID for anti-counterfeit applications. Additionally, MEBL provides a wide depth of focus for high-density MOS, curvilinear photonic designs, and a variety of high-topology microfluidic and MEMS architectures. The MB platform, with its unique configuration of multiple miniaturized electron beam columns, makes E-Beam Lithography, a revolutionary maskless lithography production system that offers compelling cost and performance advantages for today's IC fabs. These partnerships highlight SkyWater\u2019s commitment to staying at the forefront of semiconductor innovation. Story Continues SkyWater\u2019s Long-Term Prospects Seem Promising SkyWater\u2019s strategic focus on advanced packaging and specialty semiconductor solutions aligns with high-growth markets, such as artificial intelligence (AI), automotive and aerospace. Its partnerships with firms like NanoDx and the expansion of its Florida facility highlight its commitment to scaling commercial programs. The expected $40-$50 million in tooling revenues in 2025 could bolster long-term performance, particularly as it transitions Advanced Technology Services (ATS) customers into production. If SkyWater manages operational efficiencies and diversifies revenue streams, its long-term potential remains promising. However, execution risks are significant. Near-Term Challenges for SkyWater Despite its recent success, SkyWater faces near-term challenges, including declining ATS revenues, which dropped 9% sequentially in the third quarter of 2024 due to funding delays in aerospace and defense programs. Analysts are also not optimistic about its near-term prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects a revenue decline of 4.5% for 2025, with revenues expected to reach $325.6 million. Additionally, the consensus mark for the bottom line is pegged at a loss of 10 cents per share, wider than the year-ago loss of 5 cents. Macroeconomic uncertainties, cyclical industry trends and increasing competition pose risks to the company\u2019s short-term growth. Furthermore, SkyWater\u2019s stretched valuation, reflected by its Zacks Value Style Score of D, suggests the stock may not currently offer the best entry point for new investors. Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar. Zacks Rank SKYT currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that existing investors should hold the stock while new buyers should wait for a better entry point into the stock.

(NASDAQ:CRUS) Growth In ROCE To Persist editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Fri, Jan 10, 2025, 5:04 PM 2 min read In This Article: CRUS -1.14% If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Cirrus Logic ( NASDAQ:CRUS ) so let's look a bit deeper. Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Cirrus Logic, this is the formula: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.19 = US$398m \u00f7 (US$2.4b - US$229m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024) . So, Cirrus Logic has an ROCE of 19%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Semiconductor industry average of 8.6% it's much better. Check out our latest analysis for Cirrus Logic NasdaqGS:CRUS Return on Capital Employed January 10th 2025 In the above chart we have measured Cirrus Logic's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Cirrus Logic . So How Is Cirrus Logic's ROCE Trending? Cirrus Logic is displaying some positive trends. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 19%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 53%. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed. Our Take On Cirrus Logic's ROCE In summary, it's great to see that Cirrus Logic can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. Investors may not be impressed by the favorable underlying trends yet because over the last five years the stock has only returned 25% to shareholders. Given that, we'd look further into this stock in case it has more traits that could make it multiply in the long term. While Cirrus Logic looks impressive, no company is worth an infinite price.

Investing.com Wed, Jan 8, 2025, 5:21 PM 2 min read Investing.com -- Auto stocks moved lower premarket Wednesday following a CNN report suggesting that President-elect Donald Trump is considering declaring a national economic emergency to implement a new tariff program. Shares in major automakers General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford (NYSE:F), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) initially fell, while electric vehicle (EV) startups also saw declines, with Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) and Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID) down 1.3%. Chinese EV companies were hit harder, as Nio (NYSE:NIO) and XPeng (NYSE:XPEV) fell 3%, and Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) 2%. The CNN report, which cites four sources familiar with the matter, says Trump is exploring the use of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA) to unilaterally impose tariffs on imports. This law provides the president with broad authority to manage trade during a national emergency without needing to prove national security risks. The news sparked investor concern. Several chipmakers experienced losses, including Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS), which declined 1%, Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) Technology by 0.8%, Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) by 0.4%. According to CNN, the Trump team is also evaluating other legal avenues, such as section 338 and section 301 of U.S. trade law, which could allow for additional tariffs. However, they added that these options would require longer processes and potentially face legal challenges. Market reactions reflect fears that new tariffs could disrupt global supply chains and increase costs for automakers and tech companies. The proposed tariffs are part of Trump's broader strategy to reset the global balance of trade and bolster U.S. manufacturing. Reacting to the report, analysts at Vital Knowledge said the headline \"sounds negative, but it doesn\u2019t really tell us anything that\u2019s all that incremental.\" \"Investors know there will be some type of tariff increase and the process for imposing them necessitates this type of declaration. We still don\u2019t know the scope \u2013 what products/countries will be hit, what will the tariff rate be, what is the timing, etc,\" wrote the firm. The firm also believes that the Washington Post report from earlier in the week \"isn\u2019t inaccurate\" and that \"tariffs won\u2019t be as draconian as was talked about on the campaign trail.\" Nevertheless, they believe \"some new ones will be implemented and (more importantly) Trump will continue to use the topic as a negotiation cudgel, which means the threat can never be removed from the table.\" Related Articles Story Continues Trump assessing national economic emergency declaration for new tariffs - CNN Wall St set for flat open as investors assess data, Trump economic emergency

Zacks Equity Research Mon, Dec 30, 2024, 7:59 PM 3 min read In This Article: SWKS -3.99% Skyworks Solution SWKS shares have lost 5.6% over the past three months, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector and its competitor Broadcom AVGO, which offers a wider range of semiconductor solutions. While the sector has gained 9.7% over the past three months, the Broadcom stock has soared 44.3%. The underperformance was led by the dismal results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Skyworks\u2019 revenues declined 15.9% year over year in the quarter, whereas non-GAAP earnings plunged 29.5%. Skyworks\u2019 fiscal fourth-quarter performance suffered from high inventory levels, uneven demand across segments, and muted global demand in automotive and industrial markets. The broad market segment showed modest sequential growth, but weakness in infrastructure and automotive end markets hurt the overall performance. Sluggishness in wireless infrastructure and traditional data center markets, along with stiff competition from companies like Qorvo QRVO and Cirrus Logic CRUS, posed challenges. SWKS\u2019s Dull Outlook Triggers Downward Estimate Revisions Skyworks Solutions, Inc. Price and Consensus Skyworks Solutions, Inc. Price and Consensus Skyworks Solutions, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Skyworks Solutions, Inc. Quote Challenges in wireless infrastructure and traditional data center end markets are expected to continue hurting Skyworks\u2019 financial performance in the near term. Stiff competition from players like Broadcom, Qorvo and Cirrus Logic is expected to increase pricing pressure in the market and affect margins. For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Skyworks expects revenues between $1.05 billion and $1.08 billion. Non-GAAP diluted shares are expected to be $1.57 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $1.07 billion, reflecting an 11.4% year-over-year decline. The consensus mark for fiscal 2025 earnings has been revised downward by 4 cents over the past 60 days to $5.34 per share. The bottom-line estimate indicates a decline of 14.8% from fiscal 2024 earnings of $6.27 per share. Broad Portfolio to Boost Skyworks\u2019 Prospects SWKS boasts a robust portfolio, including amplifiers, antenna tuners, DC/DC converters, detectors, diodes, ProSLIC and voltage-controlled oscillators. These key components position the company to capitalize on growing demand across wireless connectivity, IoT, automotive, and data centers, offering strong prospects for growth and innovation. The company is experiencing improved demand as customers adopt Wi-Fi 6E and 7 systems, which offer higher dollar content due to increased complexity and additional bands. With Wi-Fi 7 shipments gaining momentum, the industry is entering the early phases of a multi-year upgrade cycle. Skyworks maintains a long-term bullish outlook on the broader market, supported by secular trends in edge IoT, automotive electrification, advanced security systems and AI-driven workloads. SWKS is positioning itself to capitalize on the growing demand for wireless connectivity, driven by data consumption, AI and 5G. The global mobile data use, especially for 5G, is expected to triple in the next three years. By 2029, 39 billion IoT connections, including connected cars and devices, are anticipated. Skyworks is partnering with mobile customers to create efficient connectivity solutions. Mobile revenues grew 21% sequentially, and the company expects continued growth in the December-end quarter, with normalized orders, inventory and seasonal product ramps. Story Continues SWKS\u2019s Zacks Rank & Valuation Skyworks encountered challenges from high inventory, uneven demand, and weakness in automotive and industrial markets, alongside strong competition. However, its focus on 5G, IoT and AI positions the company well for long-term growth. SWKS\u2019s Value Score of C indicates a stretched valuation at this moment. It currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which implies that investors should stay away from the stock for the time being.
