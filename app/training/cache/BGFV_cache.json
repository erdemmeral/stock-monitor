Steven G. Miller, Chairman, President and CEO, commented, \u201cWe anticipate reporting fourth quarter earnings in the middle range of our previously provided guidance range. Despite our topline results falling short of expectations, we achieved favorable performance relative to plan in both gross margin and expenses. While our sales continued to be impacted by the challenging macroeconomic environment for our consumers, the lower-than-expected sales were primarily due to weaker winter product sales, influenced by warmer-than-normal weather conditions across our footprint and minimal snowfall in the southern tier of our footprint which limited winter recreational activities. Although sales were softer than anticipated, our fourth quarter same store sales marked the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in our year-over-year sales trends.\u201d For the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, net sales were $181.6 million compared to net sales of $196.3 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Same store sales decreased 6.1% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The Company\u2019s merchandise margins decreased 23 basis points for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year period. For the fiscal 2024 full year, net sales were $795.5 million compared to net sales of $884.7 million for fiscal 2023. Same store sales decreased 9.4% for the fiscal 2024 full year compared to fiscal 2023. The Company\u2019s merchandise margins decreased 34 basis points for the fiscal 2024 full year compared to fiscal 2023. For the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, the Company now expects to report a loss per basic share in the range of $0.94 to $0.97, which compares to the Company\u2019s previous guidance for a fourth quarter loss per basic share in the range of $0.80 to $1.05. The Company\u2019s updated earnings guidance for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter includes a net benefit of $1.0 million, or $0.04 per basic share, related to an insurance settlement. For the fiscal 2024 full year, the Company now expects to report a loss per basic share in the range of $3.14 to $3.17, which includes the aforementioned net benefit related to an insurance settlement, in addition to a non-cash\u00a0charge for the establishment of a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets of $21.8\u00a0million, or $0.99 per basic share, recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Financial results for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter and full year are unaudited, preliminary, and subject to final year-end accounting entries. Story Continues The Company ended the 2024 fiscal year with a cash balance of $5.4 million and borrowings of $13.8 million under its recently-renewed $150 million credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. Merchandise inventories decreased by 4.1% as of the end of fiscal 2024 versus the end of the prior fiscal year. The Company expects to issue earnings results for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter and full year in late February 2025.

Goods Corporation EL SEGUNDO, Calif., Dec. 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (Nasdaq: BGFV) (the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cBig 5\u201d), a leading sporting goods retailer, announced today that it has entered into an agreement to amend and extend its credit facility with Bank of America, N. A. (\u201cBank of America\u201d), as administrative agent and lender (the \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d). Barry Emerson, the Company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, stated, \u201cWe are pleased to renew our credit facility, and appreciate the continued support of Bank of America. This multi-year facility is expected to help provide financial flexibility to manage our business through the current dynamic retail environment and over the long-term.\u201d The Loan Agreement, which replaces the Company\u2019s prior financing agreement with Bank of America, has a five-year term that matures in December 2029, and provides for a secured revolving credit facility with aggregate committed availability of up to $150 million. The Company may request additional increases in aggregate availability, which Bank of America has the option to provide, of up to $50 million, for an aggregate availability of up to $200 million. Loans under the new credit facility will bear interest based on SOFR rates or a specified base rate (generally Bank of America\u2019s prime rate), plus a margin that is determined based on the remaining availability under the credit line and satisfaction of financial covenants. The margin on SOFR rate loans ranges from 1.75% to 2.125% and the margin on base rate loans ranges from 0.75% to 1.125%, subject to interest rate floors of zero. The Company will be filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission a Current Report on Form 8-K, which will include additional details about the Loan Agreement.

{"text": "Zacks Initiates Coverage of Big 5 With Underperform Recommendation Debasmita Chatterjee Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 7:25 PM 3 min read In This Article: BGFV Zacks Investment Research has recently initiated coverage of Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation BGFV with an \u201cUnderperform\u201d rating. The detailed report points to a range of financial and operational headwinds that may impact the company\u2019s long-term prospects. Big 5\u2019s sales have declined 10.8% over the first nine months of 2024, largely due to persistent inflation, which has weakened consumer spending on non-essential items like sporting goods. Same-store sales dropped 10.2%, and gross profit margins contracted from 32.9% to 29.9% due to aggressive discounting to attract price-sensitive customers. This reliance on promotional strategies not only reduces profitability but also erodes the brand\u2019s long-term pricing power. Additional headwinds include rising store occupancy and distribution expenses, which increased by $4.1 million in the first nine months of 2024. These escalating costs reduce Big 5\u2019s operating flexibility and come at a time when sales are declining, creating a challenging environment for margin recovery. Meanwhile, the competitive landscape has shifted significantly as digital-first and omnichannel players capture greater market share. Big 5\u2019s traditional retail model and limited e-commerce presence place it at a disadvantage, particularly as consumers continue to gravitate toward online shopping and digitally integrated services, as highlighted by the research report. In response, Big 5 has implemented cost-control measures, including an 8.7% reduction in inventory and plans to close 11 stores by year-end. While these steps demonstrate discipline, they could limit revenue potential if demand unexpectedly rebounds. Furthermore, Big 5\u2019s dwindling cash reserves, down to $4 million as of Sept. 29, 2024, reflect financial strain that could limit the company\u2019s ability to adapt to future challenges without additional financing. Despite these pressures, Big 5\u2019s strong regional presence across the Western United States offers a valuable competitive edge, particularly in areas where outdoor activities and recreational sports drive steady demand. Additionally, the company\u2019s extensive supplier network of over 600 vendors provides sourcing flexibility, allowing it to quickly adjust to shifts in demand while avoiding over-reliance on any single supplier, as outlined in the report. Big 5\u2019s share price has experienced significant declines recently, reflecting investor concerns about the company\u2019s ability to navigate an increasingly competitive and inflationary environment. The stock\u2019s valuation stands well below its industry peers, suggesting that the market has largely priced in the company\u2019s operational challenges, limited growth potential, and heightened risk profile. Story Continues The combination of declining sales, margin erosion, rising operational costs, intensified competition, and liquidity constraints presents substantial challenges for Big 5\u2019s future performance. While the company\u2019s strong brand presence and strategic focus on seasonal demand offer some resilience, the underlying risks indicate a potentially tough path forward.
