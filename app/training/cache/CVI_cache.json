(CVI) Is One of the Worst Performing Energy Stocks in 2024? Mashaid Ahmed Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 10:20 PM 6 min read In This Article: CVI -0.16% We recently compiled a list of the 10 Worst Performing Energy Stocks in 2024 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where CVR Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CVI ) stands against other worst performing energy stocks in 2024. U.S. Crude oil prices fell 2.56% on Tuesday, January 21, with U.S. crude closing at $76.89 per barrel. Global benchmark Brent crude also declined, settling at $79.29 per barrel, a decrease of 86 cents or 1.07%. The drop in oil prices came as President Donald Trump, following his inauguration on Monday, announced that his administration was considering imposing 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. These tariffs could potentially slow economic growth and, in turn, impact fuel demand. In addition to the tariff considerations, President Trump signed a series of executive actions aimed at boosting domestic energy production. He declared a national energy emergency, sought to roll back restrictions on offshore drilling that were implemented during the Biden administration, and lifted the pause on new liquified natural gas (LNG) exports. These moves are expected to stimulate the U.S. energy sector by increasing domestic production and easing regulatory constraints.

In an interview with Yahoo Finance on January 22, Andy Lipow, President at Lipow Oil Associates, discussed the implications of President Trump\u2019s declaration of a national energy emergency and his push for increased oil and gas production in the United States. Andy Lipow noted that while the Trump Administration\u2019s policy of \u201cdrill baby drill\u201d aims to boost domestic oil production, it does not necessarily translate into immediate or significant increases in exploration and production. The decision to invest in new drilling operations, especially in high-cost areas such as the offshore Gulf of Mexico and Alaska, depends on the financial viability and the current price of crude oil. Despite the easing of regulations and the availability of more acreage, oil companies will weigh the potential financial rewards of investing large sums of money to increase production. Lipow acknowledged that the United States is already at peak oil production, outpacing both Russia and Saudi Arabia. This trend has developed over the past decade, and while the U.S. is expected to set another production record in 2025, the impact on global oil prices is not straightforward. The market is more influenced by the Administration\u2019s policies overseas, such as sanctions on Russian oil exports and Iranian oil production. According to Lipow. the imposition of 25% tariffs on oil imports from Canada and Mexico could divert these supplies elsewhere, potentially raising the cost of gasoline and diesel for U.S. consumers. This is contrary to the Trump Administration\u2019s goal of lowering energy costs. Lipow expressed that the combination of these factors, including sanctions on Russia, Iran, and Venezuela, coupled with slow global oil demand growth, is likely to result in higher prices throughout the year. Story Continues Lipow believes that the rollback of executive orders, such as lifting the freeze on new liquefied natural gas (LNG) permits, is seen as positive for U.S. energy production. The recent opening of new LNG export facilities in Louisiana and Corpus Christi, along with several more facilities coming online in the next couple of years, is expected to boost U.S. energy exports. The Trump administration\u2019s focus on supporting domestic energy production through regulatory rollbacks, increased access to resources, and incentives for new projects is expected to provide much-needed relief for companies currently facing challenges.

Cooper Companies Stock in Your Portfolio Now Zacks Equity Research Fri, Jan 10, 2025, 3:16 PM 5 min read In this article: COO -1.25% RMD +1.85% BSX +0.69% CAH +1.35% The Cooper Companies, Inc. COO is well-poised for growth on the back of strong prospects in its CooperVision (CVI) and CooperSurgical (CSI) business segments. Acquisitions boost the company\u2019s portfolio and buoy optimism. However, unfavorable currency movements and rising costs continue to hurt revenues and margins, respectively. Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have risen 7.4% in the past six months compared with the industry's 4.9% growth. The S&P 500 Index has gained 5.3% in the said time frame. The Cooper Companies, with a market capitalization of $18.34 billion, is a global specialty medical device company. The company\u2019s bottom line is estimated to improve 9.9% over the next five years. Its earnings beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 4.87%. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research What's Driving COO\u2019s Performance? The Cooper Companies continues to lead the specialty contact lens market with its innovative product lineup, flexibility and strong relationships with key accounts. Its flagship silicone hydrogel lenses, such as MyDay and Clariti, are expected to fuel robust sales in the upcoming quarters. Additionally, its silicone hydrogel FRP lenses, Biofinity and Avaira, are projected to support revenue growth. The contact lens market is expected to grow 5-7% in 2025, supported by the long-term macro growth trend of more people needing vision correction. Strong demand for Cooper Companies\u2019 lenses has led to a gain in market share as the company remains the leader in the category. A shift in demand toward higher value products, coupled with price hikes by the company for certain lenses, buoys optimism. The company\u2019s focus on launching new products is promising. In the fourth quarter, the CVI segment showed solid growth, with revenues rising 9% at constant currency to $676.4 million. According to management, the strong demand for silicone hydrogel lenses contributed to this performance. We expect CVI revenues to grow more than 7% organically for the next three years. Our model anticipates total revenues of $2.76 billion for the CVI segment in fiscal 2025. The Cooper Companies also offers products for myopia management. MiSight is the key growth product in the company\u2019s myopia management portfolio as it is the only FDA-approved contact lens for myopia control, especially in children. The company registered sales growth of 7% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 from myopia management portfolio. MiSight sales were up 24%. The positive trend for MiSight in the Americas and EMEA is likely to continue in fiscal 2025, with an expected growth rate of 40%. Moreover, sales in the Asia Pacific region are likely to improve going forward after a few challenging quarters. Story continues COO is also well-positioned to capitalize on its expanding CSI product portfolio. Strong demand for its products and services in the CSI portfolio, especially for fertility, persisted in 2024. The company expects CSI revenues to continue this trend in fiscal 2025 as well. It expects annual sales in the targeted market for CSI products and services, currently more than $3 billion, to grow 5-10% over the long term. The CSI portfolio demonstrated robust growth during the fourth quarter, with revenues increasing 12% year over year to $342 million. The fertility business led the performance, growing 15% year over year (13% organically), driven by strong demand for consumables, reproductive genetic testing and capital equipment. Key innovations, such as advanced genomics and AI-driven fertility solutions, further enhanced this segment, underscored by its success at the American Society of Reproductive Medicine Conference. Additionally, the office and surgical segment contributed $203 million in revenues, up 11%, supported by growth in minimally invasive gynecological surgical devices and labor and delivery products. Recent acquisitions, including obp Surgical, added momentum. Our model predicts CSI revenues to be $1.29 billion in fiscal 2025, indicating organic growth of 6% year over year. What's Weighing on the Stock? The Cooper Companies generates a significant portion of its revenues in foreign currencies.

What has Jeff Clark, Eric Fry, and Louis Navellier looking to buy \u2026 your choice of short-term trade or long-term investment \u2026 enormous interest in TradeSmith\u2019s new Seasonality Tool We have a rare \u201ctriple buy\u201d recommendation developing today. This particular trade/investment has recently been highlighted and endorsed independently by three of our experts: Louis Navellier, Eric Fry, and Jeff Clark. These analysts are playing the trade different ways. From \u201cshort-term trade\u201d \u2026 to \u201cmulti-year investment\u201d \u2026 to aggressive targeting of capital gains with options \u2026 to more conservative buy-and-holding with an income focus\u2026 there\u2019s something for every type of investor. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips We\u2019re talking about the unfolding opportunity in fossil fuels. Several market trends are converging to create a profit-making set-up that has grabbed a lot of attention, and could put a nice wad of cash in your pocket. Let\u2019s get into the details. Beginning with a shorter-term trade opportunity, how is Jeff Clark sizing up Big Oil today? For newer Digest readers, Jeff is a 40-year market veteran who profitably trades the markets regardless of direction \u2013 up, down, or sideways. He uses a suite of momentum indicators and moving averages to provide clues about where stocks are going next. Right now, his indicators are telling him that a bullish move higher is coming for Big Oil. From Jeff\u2019s latest issue of Market Minute yesterday: The Bullish Percent Index for the energy sector (BPENER) is on the verge of generating a buy signal. And, if this signal plays out similarly to previous buy signals, then oil stocks could play a big game of \u201ccatch up.\u201d To make sure we\u2019re all on the same page, a bullish percent index (BPI) measures the percentage of stocks in a sector that are trading with bullish technical patterns. It\u2019s designed to measure overbought and oversold conditions. An index is overbought when it registers above 80 \u2013 meaning 80% of the stocks in the sector are trading with bullish patterns. An index is oversold when it drops below 30. Jeff explains that buy signals occur when the BPENER turns higher from oversold conditions. Now, that hasn\u2019t happened yet as I write. But the BPENER is in oversold territory. Specifically, as of Jeff\u2019s analysis, it clocks in at 28.57, which means it could generate a buy signal any day now by turning north and climbing above 30. So, what happened the last time this indicator triggered? Let\u2019s go back to Jeff: In all of 2024, we only got one buy signal from the BPENER. That was back in early August. Story Continues XLE (the Energy Select Sector Fund) gained 5% almost immediately. It then dipped to a lower low in September before launching a more significant rally that generated a 15% gain less than three months later. XLE is currently trading at about the same price it was back in August. The sector is just about as oversold as it was back then as well. Here\u2019s Jeff\u2019s bottom line: This looks like a bullish setup to me. And, with the incoming Trump administration chanting the mantra of \u201cDrill baby drill,\u201d 2025 could prove to be a good year for the oil stocks. But could \u201cDrill baby drill\u201d result in too much supply, weighing on oil/stock prices over a medium-term horizon? That\u2019s possible \u2013 which is why our macro expert Eric Fry has suggested playing fossil fuels from a different angle\u2026 Volume. Here\u2019s Eric in his free e-letter, Smart Money , reminding his readers about what happened the last time U.S. production volumes spiked (due to the shale revolution): [Pipeline, refiner, and export stocks] thrived because their revenues were tied to the volumes of hydrocarbons they handle, not the price. The cheaper the oil and gas America pumped from the ground, the more money these \u201cdownstream\u201d companies printed every quarter. Pipeline firms succeeded by acting like toll roads, taking the same fee for every \u201ccar\u201d (i.e., cubic foot of gas) regardless of the vehicle\u2019s value. Refiners benefited from cheaper feedstocks. And exporters saw a bonanza as the world snapped up America\u2019s low-cost fuels. Exploration and production companies (\u201cupstream\u201d energy companies), on the other hand, saw the value of their reserves drop for every decline in energy prices. We see a similar story playing out in the energy sector under a Trump 2.0 presidency. As to specific stocks that performed well the last time we were in this environment, Eric has highlighted Cheniere Energy Inc. ( LNG ), CVR Energy Inc. ( CVI ), Valero Energy Corp. ( VLO ), Marathon Petroleum Corp. ( MPC ), and ConocoPhillips ( COP ). They all enjoyed double-digit gains. To be clear, these aren\u2019t official recommendations, but they\u2019re good starting points for your own research. And if you\u2019re interested in playing this with a focus on big income, check out the pipeline plays Enterprise Products Partners ( EPD ), Energy Transfer LP ( ET ), and MPLX LP ( MPLX ). They\u2019re offering dividend yields of 6.50%, 6.58%, and 7.97%, respectively. Finally, legendary investor Louis Navellier is eyeing natural gas stocks due to their critical importance in fueling AI data centers The AI megatrend has been fueling market gains for the last two years, and demand for AI data centers will be strong for years to come. To illustrate, let\u2019s begin with research from Goldman Sachs: For years, data centers displayed a remarkably stable appetite for power, even as their workloads mounted. Now, as the pace of efficiency gains in electricity use slows and the AI revolution gathers steam, Goldman Sachs Research estimates that data center power demand will grow 160% by 2030\u2026 Over the last decade, US power demand growth has been roughly zero, even though the population and its economic activity have increased\u2026 But that is set to change. Between 2022 and 2030, the demand for power will rise roughly 2.4%, Goldman Sachs Research estimates \u2014 and around 0.9 percent points of that figure will be tied to data centers. That kind of spike in power demand hasn\u2019t been seen in the US since the early years of this century. It will be stoked partly by electrification and industrial reshoring, but also by AI. Data centers will use 8% of US power by 2030, compared with 3% in 2022. So, what will power these data centers? Well, they will need a reliable base-load power source that can provide electricity consistently, regardless of external conditions (like weather or time of day, which throws cold water on wind and solar). Louis predicts the way our world will meet this demand is through natural gas turbines: It\u2019s the only current source that is widely available, relatively clean \u2013 and most important of all, cheap. So, within the context of the\u00a0AI Boom, natural gas just makes common sense. We have more than 625 trillion cubic feet of natural gas under the ground in America \u2013 ready to consume. That\u2019s enough gas to produce 30 gigawatts\u2026 for the next 2.7 billion years\u2026 at an extremely low cost. I believe Trump, as soon as he takes office, is going to make sure we can access all that stored energy. Louis goes on to predict that one of Trump\u2019s first acts as president will be to sign an emergency executive order on energy. Following that, Trump will roll back Biden\u2019s environmental regulations\u2026 instruct his nominee to lead the Department of Energy, Chris Wright, to open the spigot on American energy production\u2026 and then open more land and sea for oil and natural gas drilling, while building more natural gas infrastructure. This is how Louis believes we\u2019ll provide data centers with the enormous quantities of natural gas they\u2019ll need to transition to an AI-driven world. But wait\u2026 What about the risk we highlighted a moment ago which Eric echoed \u2013 the risk of too much supply flooding the market, pushing down prices? First, due to the energy demand we just looked at, demand for natural gas should accelerate dramatically in the coming years, helping to offset the risk of supply increases. Second, as a quant investor, Louis follows fundamental strength. So, even if a supply glut materializes, Louis will monitor the impact on profitability. As long as his chosen energy companies are generating outsized profits, resulting in higher stock prices, he\u2019ll stick with them. If/when the numbers change, Louis will move on to the next area of market strength. That\u2019s the benefit of a quant approach. Whichever way best suites you, take a good look at this fossil fuels opportunity My favorite investment ideas are the simplest. And with fossil fuels, the case for investing is simple: That major cold snap happening in the U.S. right now? Bullish for natural gas Trump\u2019s election and his interest in making the U.S. completely energy independent and the world\u2019s biggest energy supplier? Bullish for fossil fuels in general The enormous energy needs of AI and cutting-edge tech? Bullish for natural gas and pipeline stocks Europe\u2019s need for energy and its current overreliance on Russian natural gas? Bullish for U.S. natural gas The \u201cclean\u201d electric energy that fuels electric vehicles? A significant portion is from natural gas. Bullish Circling back to Trump, his dislike of the \u201cGreen New Scam\u201d? Get ready to wave goodbye to various green energy subsidies \u2013 bullish for fossil fuels Finally, the cyclical nature of too much selling leading to great buying opportunities? That\u2019s where certain fossil fuels stocks find themselves today \u2013 bullish It\u2019s rare when so many of our analysts are bullish on the same set-up simultaneously. But that\u2019s what we have today, and it\u2019s not hard to understand why. If you\u2019re looking to put money to work today, give this opportunity a good look. Before we sign off, a quick note\u2026 Yesterday morning, TradeSmith\u2019s CEO Keith Kaplan held a live event that detailed his new Seasonality Tool. We expected it would garner enormous interest due to the edge it gives investors, but what we\u2019ve seen over the last 24 hours has been off the charts. If you\u2019re less familiar, this Seasonality Tool is a robust software system that scans 50,000 data points daily. The goal is to pinpoint the best days to buy and sell individual stocks. Specifically, the tool searches for historical, repeatable price patterns, specific to any given stock. The core idea is \u201cbased on historical data, can we identify specific stretches of days or weeks when a stock has risen consistently?\u201d The example we provided earlier this week was with Nvidia. For the past 15 years, Nvidia shot up during a 15-day time span, starting October 24, every single year. There was a 100% hit rate across that entire 15-year stretch. The Seasonality Tool is engineered to find such historical profit windows, alerting you ahead of time. Keith debuted the tool yesterday morning, and as just noted, the interest/feedback has been phenomenal. This makes sense to me. A moment ago, I wrote how my favorite investment ideas are the simplest. Well, what\u2019s simpler than buying a stock at a time when years of historical market data suggests that stock is about to rise?
