(NYSE:MEG) in its Q4 2024 investor letter: \"Shares of Montrose Environmental Group, Inc. (NYSE:MEG), a leading environmental services firm, were down due to a multitude of issues and negative news flow. Previously, the stock came under pressure when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the Chevron Doctrine in July, raising investor concerns about the authority of federal agencies to enforce environmental regulations that drive portions of Montrose\u2019s business. In September, shares sank after a short report targeted the company. Finally, the perception that Montrose will fare worse under the incoming administration due to a reduced focus on regulation also hurt shares. Management has refuted all these points and met with investors to give confidence around their 2025 outlook. They noted the company grew under the prior Trump administration and paused acquisitions in the short term to demonstrate organic revenue growth and cash flow generation, which the short report claimed was lacking.

$47.54 Trillion by 2030, Driven by AI, Omnichannel Strategies, and Sustainability Research and Markets Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 1:24 PM 6 min read Company Logo B2B E-Commerce Market B2B E-Commerce Market Dublin, Jan. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"B2B E-Commerce Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2020-2030F\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The B2B E-Commerce Market was valued at USD 19.34 Trillion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 47.54 Trillion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 16.17%. As businesses recognize the advantages of conducting transactions online, such as better accessibility to global markets, real-time tracking, and the ability to reach a wider pool of suppliers and buyers, the demand for B2B platforms has surged. Advancements in technology such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data analytics are further driving this growth by providing businesses with more personalized, efficient, and data-driven solutions. The rise of mobile commerce, secure payment systems, and cloud-based platforms also contributes significantly to the market's expansion, making it easier for businesses to access and use e-commerce solutions. The shift toward remote work, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has made digital solutions more important than ever for businesses to maintain supply chain continuity and operational efficiency. In the coming years, B2B e-commerce is expected to continue its upward trajectory as more businesses digitize their operations and increasingly rely on online platforms for procurement, sales, and customer service. Global expansion and cross-border trade will further fuel the market, as businesses seek to engage with international suppliers and customers. The growing demand for personalized, efficient, and scalable solutions that can handle large volumes of transactions will drive the innovation of B2B e-commerce platforms, making them more sophisticated and user-friendly. The rise of sustainability concerns and green procurement practices will encourage businesses to adopt digital platforms that support eco-friendly initiatives and supply chain transparency. Overall, the B2B e-commerce market is set for robust growth driven by technological advancements, a shift toward digital solutions, and an increasing focus on operational efficiency and global reach. Key Market Trends Adoption of Artificial Intelligence and Automation One of the most notable trends in the B2B E-Commerce market is the increasing integration of artificial intelligence and automation technologies. Artificial intelligence is being leveraged to improve customer experiences, streamline operations, and enhance decision-making processes. Machine learning algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to predict purchasing behaviors, optimize pricing strategies, and recommend products to businesses based on their previous interactions and preferences. This level of personalization helps businesses provide more targeted and relevant offerings, improving the overall customer experience and increasing conversion rates. Additionally, automation technologies are helping businesses reduce manual tasks, such as order processing, inventory management, and customer service. Robotic process automation (RPA) is being used to handle repetitive tasks, improving efficiency and reducing the risk of human error. Automation in supply chain management also ensures real-time tracking and faster order fulfillment, allowing businesses to respond more quickly to market demands. As artificial intelligence and automation become more sophisticated, businesses in the B2B E-Commerce sector are increasingly adopting these technologies to stay competitive, reduce operational costs, and enhance their overall efficiency. Rise of Omnichannel Strategies The rise of omnichannel strategies is another prominent trend within the B2B E-Commerce market. Businesses are increasingly adopting omnichannel approaches that integrate online and offline touchpoints, providing customers with a seamless experience across multiple channels. This trend reflects the shift in how businesses interact with their clients and suppliers, as organizations look to create consistent, cohesive experiences regardless of whether the transaction occurs through a website, mobile app, social media, or even face-to-face interactions. For instance, a business might use a digital platform to place orders but also engage in personalized service via phone or in-person meetings. By offering multiple channels of communication and transaction, businesses can cater to the diverse preferences of their clients, improving customer satisfaction and loyalty. Omnichannel strategies also provide businesses with valuable data across different channels, enabling more informed decision-making and more personalized offerings. As businesses in the B2B E-Commerce market seek to improve customer engagement and optimize their sales processes, the adoption of omnichannel strategies will continue to be a key trend, driving innovation and growth within the industry. Sustainability and Ethical Sourcing Initiatives Sustainability and ethical sourcing are emerging as critical trends in the B2B E-Commerce market, driven by the increasing importance of environmental and social responsibility. Businesses are becoming more aware of their environmental impact and are adopting greener practices to meet the demands of both regulators and conscious consumers. This shift is particularly important as companies are increasingly held accountable for the sustainability of their supply chains, sourcing materials, and products from suppliers that align with environmental and ethical standards. In the B2B E-Commerce space, platforms are integrating tools to help businesses assess the sustainability of their supply chains, track carbon footprints, and ensure compliance with ethical sourcing standards. Many companies are now prioritizing green procurement by selecting vendors that follow sustainable practices, such as reducing waste or utilizing renewable resources. Additionally, with growing consumer and regulatory pressure, there is an increasing emphasis on transparency in business operations. E-commerce platforms are incorporating features that allow businesses to provide detailed information about the origin of their products, the materials used, and the impact of their supply chain on the environment. This trend is expected to continue as companies embrace sustainability as not just a compliance measure but a key business differentiator in the competitive B2B E-Commerce landscape.

Number One-Selling\u00b9, Most-Award-Winning\u00b2 American Single Malt Whiskey Launches Founder's Release, Honoring American Single Malt's Federal Designation as a Distinct Alcohol Category PR Newswire Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 6:00 PM 5 min read DENVER , Jan. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Stranahan's \u00ae , the nation's number one-selling American single malt, today announces Founder's Release : a special-edition, 12-year-aged, full-bodied whiskey at 120 proof - the highest proof liquid the brand has ever released on a national level. Founder's Release officially commemorates the historic moment set to take place on January 19th when American single malt becomes the first new whiskey category to be recognized in over 50 years - a federal action and landmark event that immediately elevates American single malts alongside bourbon and other iconic American spirits. At 12 years old, Founder's Release is among Stranahan's highest age statements \u2013 a claim few other brands in its category can make. Stranahan's Colorado Whiskey Logo (PRNewsfoto/Stranahan\u2019s) \"Twenty years ago, Stranahan's began trailblazing the American single malt category, focusing on perfecting one recipe made with 100% malted barley, Rocky Mountain spring water, and time in American White Oak barrels\u2014all crafted one mile high in Denver, Colorado ,\" said Justin Aden , Head Blender at Stranahan's. \"Over the past two decades, we've become the most awarded in the category, amassed perhaps the deepest inventory of well-aged American single malt, and demonstrated what's possible with dedication to one craft.\" Aden continued, \"We've long carried a torch for American single malt, and we couldn't be prouder to see it recognized as an official category. Founder's Release 12 Year Old is a celebration of this milestone, our two decades of craftsmanship, and everyone\u2014especially our loyal Stranafans\u2014who have bottled their passion and stayed the course alongside us.\" Stranahan's cask strength limited edition Founder's Release first matured in new, charred American white oak barrels before finishing time in casks that had previously matured bourbon and blonde ale for a total maturation time of 12 years. The resulting liquid is rich with milk chocolate, coffee cream liqueur, pecan and nutmeg on the nose and palate, while amaretto, bubbly cream soda and clove spice round out the finish. Like every Stranahan's bottle, Founder's Release is made from 100% malted barley and cut with Eldorado Spring water, mashed, fermented, distilled, aged and bottled entirely one mile high in Denver, CO. Stranahan's was founded by Jess Graber , a one-time Colorado moonshiner who opened his state's first legal, post-Prohibition distillery in 2004. He took a chance on a type of whiskey that few knew at the time, but he was bullish about from the start. Founder's Release honors him and his craft alongside the category's official recognition. Story Continues \"They said we were crazy, and maybe we were, but we were believers in American single malt from the start. It was time to wake people up to what American whiskey could be. And now, to see American single malt get the recognition and attention it deserves, all I can say is, it's a very proud day,\" said Graber. \"It's a day to celebrate what we do best and raise a glass. Cheers!\" Fans in Stranahan's hometowns of Denver and Aspen are also invited to a multi-day Designation Day celebration. Throughout the month of January while supplies last, the brand's distillery and Aspen Whiskey Lodge will pour drams of four ultra-rare, iconic Stranahan's whiskeys from deep in the vaults: a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to mark a historic event for American single malt whiskey. \"As the category leader in American single malt whiskey and one of its pioneers, Stranahan's applauds the TTB's designation of American single malt whiskey as an official category,\" said Lander Otegui, Senior Vice President of Marketing at Proximo Spirits, Stranahan's parent company. \"This opens up the possibility of American single malt whiskey to the global market, with a product that can compete head to head with the most prestigious whiskey brands in the world. Move over scotch. American single malt whiskeys are here to stay.\" Founder's Release is the newest expression from the most award-winning, pioneering, ever-innovating leader in American single malt \u2013 one that has dedicated itself to and has solely produced this distinct type of American whiskey for over 20 years, borne of 100% malted barley, yeast, pristine Rocky Mountain water and time in the barrel. This liquid was maturing and awaiting the monumental day when the federal government would issue standards that define American single malts and protect producers that strictly adhere to those standards.\u00a0Stranahan's vigorously advocated for category ratification as a longtime member of the American Single Malt Whiskey Commission . That day has finally come. Fans can be one of the first to order Founder's Release by getting notified of its availability here , with delivery expected later this winter.

plead for \u2018grand bargain\u2019 with Trump to avoid tariffs Tim Wallace Thu, Jan 16, 2025, 8:48 PM 3 min read In This Article: STLAM.MI -1.21% Donald Trump has promised to levy heavy tariffs on Chinese imports to the US - Samuel Corum/Getty Images Carmakers including BMW and Mercedes have urged Brussels to strike a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with Donald Trump to prevent disaster for Europe\u2019s auto industry. The European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association (ACEA) is calling on the European Commission to fight to keep open trade with both the US and China even as the two nations enter a new trade war. The plea comes as Mr Trump prepares to return to the White House next week. He has promised to levy heavy tariffs on Chinese imports to the US and there are fears that the new president will look unfavourably on countries that continue to trade freely with Beijing. The ACEA, which also represents manufacturers such as Renault, Volkswagen and Jaguar Land Rover, said both the US and China were equally vital to the success of the Continent\u2019s car industry. Ola K\u00e4llenius, president of the group and chairman of the management board of Mercedes-Benz, said in a letter to EU leaders: \u201cOverall, it is essential to recognise that trade with China and the US is the most vital for the prosperity of the European economy. \u201cThe EU should seek a grand bargain with the US and attempt to avoid a potential trade conflict.\u201d Closer ties with China are needed, he added. The EU has ramped up tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars, a move opposed by much of the German car industry over fears Beijing will retaliate with sanctions of its own. Mr K\u00e4llenius wrote: \u201cBoth regions, the EU and China, want to protect jobs in their home markets, while reaping the benefits of free international trade. In that regard, both sides have an interest in finding an agreement. \u201cPotential trade wars have no winners. Protectionist measures are not necessarily the best solution.\u201d The request comes at a time of intense pressure on the European car industry, which has struggled to compete with low-cost Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) and fund its own transition to electric. Stellantis, which owns Vauxhall, is closing its factory in Luton , while Volkswagen has slashed pay as part of a deal to avert plant closures in its native Germany. Ford has also set out plans to cut 800 jobs in the UK amid weak sales of electric vehicles. Attempts to increase European battery production have also struggled, with Britishvolt and Sweden\u2019s Northvolt running into trouble when trying to establish gigafactories. Stellantis, which owns Vauxhall, has already announced plans to close its factory in Luton - Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg The ACEA urged the EU to offer subsidies and incentives to drivers to buy EVs, rather than punishing manufacturers with fines for failing to sell enough of the new models. Analysts warned that it may not be possible for Brussels to thread a path between China and the US, given the pair are at loggerheads over trade practices. Story Continues Michael Every at Rabobank said Mr Trump\u2019s policy announcements to date \u201cstrongly suggest what the logic of Maga already points to a world where very few will be free to\u00a0choose to trade openly with both sides, as today.\u201d He said: \u201cEurope may have to decide which is the least worst option for it with the best possibility of compensating future growth after a set-back \u2013 and I mean Europe, not German auto firms, or any one lobby group.\u201d The new president may choose to declare trade policy a matter of national security, enabling him to impose tariffs via executive order from the moment of his inauguration on Monday. Alternatively, he could take a slower path seeking congressional approval for taxes on imports, which would give Brussels more time to seek to negotiate.

Initial Focus of Agreement is Promoting the Use of the AP300\u2122 Small Modular Reactor for both Grid-Tied and Dedicated Industrial Applications in New Brunswick, Canada SAINT JOHN, New Brunswick, January 14, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Westinghouse Electric Company and the North Shore Mi\u2019kmaq Tribal Council (NSMTC) today announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to promote the selection and deployment of Westinghouse technology for nuclear new build projects in New Brunswick. Under the agreement, the initial focus will be on exploring possibilities for the AP300\u2122 small modular reactor (SMR) for both grid power and dedicated industrial purposes. The agreement also covers the investigation of opportunities for the eVinci\u2122 microreactor to serve remote, stand-alone communities and industrial sites such as mines as well as supporting global AP1000\u00ae projects. \"The North Shore Mi\u2019kmaq Tribal Council knows SMR technologies are an essential part of the future of clean energy,\" said Jim Ward, NSMTC General Manager. \"This MoU marks an important step toward sustainability for our First Nations youth and communities. By exploring the technologies that Westinghouse brings to the table, we are advancing New Brunswick\u2019s clean energy strategy and creating economic opportunities for our NSMTC Member Nations, and for the province and region as a whole.\" The North Shore Mi\u2019kmaq Tribal Council is dedicated to fostering innovation and advancing Indigenous involvement in major projects within Mi\u2019kma\u2019ki. The NSMTC primarily serves seven Member Nations while extending support to 25 additional First Nations across Atlantic Canada. The council provides service delivery, technical support, and capacity-building in water and waste management, housing and infrastructure, post-secondary education funding, training and employment, community development, clean energy opportunities, environmental stewardship, and health service coordination. The NSMTC\u2019s mission is to foster the health, sustainability, and economic prosperity of its Member Nations. \"Westinghouse is proud to work closely with NSMTC to share our industry-leading nuclear technology expertise to support New Brunswick\u2019s clean energy and economic objectives,\" said Dan Lipman, President of Westinghouse Energy Systems. \"Based on the proven, licensed and operating AP1000 reactor, the AP300 SMR can provide clean, reliable, safe and affordable energy for rate payers, Indigenous communities, and industrial applications in the province.\" \"We recognize the importance of having Indigenous rights holders as key decision makers for all new infrastructure projects, and we are committed to deepening our partnership with NSMTC as we work together to explore new build opportunities in New Brunswick,\" said John Gorman, President of Westinghouse Canada. \"Westinghouse looks forward to a long and fruitful collaboration that will benefit the province, its people and its economy for years to come.\" Story Continues Owned by Canadian energy powerhouses Brookfield and Cameco, Westinghouse offers the only SMR based on an advanced, large Generation III+ unit already in operation globally \u2013 the AP1000 reactor. Unlike every other SMR under development with first-of-a-kind technologies and risks, Westinghouse\u2019s AP300 SMR uses AP1000 engineering, components and supply chain to streamline licensing and leverage available technical skills. These factors provide confidence that the first operating unit will be available in the early 2030s. In addition, the passively safe AP300 SMR requires foundations of only 14 meters in depth, has a compact, safety-related footprint of only 5 square meters per MWe, and has an industry-leading load following capability of 15MWe per minute, making it the perfect complement to a zero-carbon grid with a high percentage of renewable generation. Westinghouse Electric Company is shaping the future of carbon-free energy by providing safe, innovative nuclear and other clean power technologies and services globally. Westinghouse supplied the world\u2019s first commercial pressurized water reactor in 1957 and the company\u2019s technology is the basis for nearly one-half of the world's operating nuclear plants. Over 135 years of innovation makes Westinghouse the preferred partner for advanced technologies covering the complete nuclear energy life cycle.

The NSMTC is the foremost advocate in Atlantic Canada for Indigenous-led investment in clean, affordable, reliable nuclear energy technologies. The NSMTC envisions a future with New Brunswick as a world leader in clean nuclear energy and the many economic benefits that can be built alongside a thriving nuclear sector: medical isotopes and nuclear medicine, data centers, advanced manufacturing, hydrogen production, indoor agriculture, and research, innovation, and science.
