AT&T 4Q24 EARNINGS & HIGHLIGHTS Consolidated Financial Results Revenues for the fourth quarter totaled $32.3 billion versus $32.0 billion in the year-ago quarter, up 0.9%. This was due to higher Mobility service and equipment revenues and Consumer Wireline revenues, partially offset by declines in Business Wireline and Mexico . Operating expenses were $27.0 billion versus $26.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. Operating expenses increased primarily due to higher depreciation from accelerated depreciation on wireless network equipment associated with our Open RAN network modernization efforts, as well as our continued fiber investment and network upgrades. Additionally, equipment costs increased year over year in line with higher Mobility equipment revenues and these increases were partially offset by a prior-year charge, that did not recur, for the abandonment of non-deployed wireless equipment in connection with our network modernization efforts, and benefits from continued transformation. Operating income was $5.3 billion , consistent with the year-ago quarter. When adjusting for certain items, adjusted operating income* was $5.4 billion versus $5.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. Equity in net income of affiliates was $1.1 billion , primarily from the DIRECTV investment, versus $0.3 billion in the year-ago quarter, reflecting cash distributions received by AT&T in excess of AT&T's share of DIRECTV's earnings. Net income was $4.4 billion versus $2.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. Net income (loss) attributable to common stock was $4.0 billion versus $2.1 billion in the year-ago quarter. Earnings per diluted common share was $0.56 versus $0.30 in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for ($0.02) which includes a benefit from tax items offset by an actuarial loss on benefit plans and other items, adjusted earnings per diluted common share* was $0.54 , consistent with the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA * was $10.8 billion versus $10.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. Cash from operating activities was $11.9 billion , up $0.5 billion year over year, reflecting higher cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as operating, working capital timing, including lower device payments, and operational improvements, partially offset by higher cash tax payments. Capital expenditures were $6.8 billion versus $4.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. Capital investment * totaled $7.1 billion versus $5.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. Cash payments for vendor financing totaled $0.2 billion versus $1.0 billion in the year-ago quarter. Free cash flow * was $4.8 billion versus $6.4 billion in the year-ago quarter as the Company continued to drive a more ratable quarterly free cash flow cadence. Full-Year Financial Results Revenues for the full year totaled $122.3 billion versus $122.4 billion in 2023, down 0.1%, primarily driven by lower revenues from Business Wireline service revenue and Mobility equipment revenue, offset by higher Mobility service and Consumer Wireline, and Mexico revenues. Operating expenses for the full year were $103.3 billion versus $99.0 billion in 2023, primarily due to a $4.4 billion non-cash goodwill impairment in the third quarter. Additionally, the annual increase was driven by our Open RAN network modernization efforts, including accelerated depreciation on wireless network equipment and restructuring costs, and higher depreciation from continued fiber investment and network upgrades, partially offset by lower Mobility equipment costs from lower sales volumes and benefits from continued transformation efforts, including lower personnel. Operating income for the full year was $19.0 billion versus $23.5 billion in 2023. When adjusting for certain items, adjusted operating income* was $24.2 billion versus $24.7 billion a year ago. Equity in net income of affiliates for the full year was $2.0 billion , primarily from the DIRECTV investment. With adjustment for our proportionate share of intangible amortization, adjusted equity in net income from the DIRECTV investment* for full-year 2024 was $2.8 billion . Net income for the full year was $12.3 billion versus $15.6 billion a year ago. Net income attributable to common stock for the full year was $10.7 billion versus $14.2 billion a year ago. Earnings per diluted common share was $1.49 versus $1.97 for full-year 2023. With adjustments for both years, adjusted earnings per diluted common share* was $2.26 compared to $2.41 for full-year 2023. Adjusted earnings per diluted common share, excluding DIRECTV*, was $1.95 for full-year 2024. Adjusted EBITDA * for the full year was $44.8 billion versus $43.4 billion a year ago. Cash from operating activities for the full year was $38.8 billion , up $0.5 billion from a year ago, reflecting working capital timing and operational improvements, partially offset by higher cash tax payments. Capital expenditures were $20.3 billion for the full year versus $17.9 billion a year ago. Capital investment * totaled $22.1 billion for the full year versus $23.6 billion a year ago. Cash payments for vendor financing totaled $1.8 billion versus $5.7 billion a year ago. Free cash flow * was $17.6 billion for the full year compared to $16.8 billion a year ago.

Cautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements Information set forth in this news release contains financial estimates and other forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially. A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in AT&T's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AT&T disclaims any obligation to update and revise statements contained in this news release based on new information or otherwise. This news release may contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP financial measures and the GAAP financial measures are available on the Company's website at https://investors.att.com . Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations to GAAP Measures Schedules and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures cited in this document to the most directly comparable financial measures under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) can be found at https://investors.att.com and in our Form 8-K dated January\u00a027, 2025. Adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted operating income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, net debt and net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures frequently used by investors and credit rating agencies. Adjusted diluted EPS is calculated by excluding from operating revenues, operating expenses, other income (expenses) and income tax expense, certain significant items that are non-operational or non-recurring in nature, including dispositions and merger integration and transaction costs, actuarial gains and losses, significant abandonments and impairments, benefit-related gains and losses, employee separation and other material gains and losses. Non-operational items arising from asset acquisitions and dispositions include the amortization of intangible assets. While the expense associated with the amortization of certain wireless licenses and customer lists is excluded, the revenue of the acquired companies is reflected in the measure and those assets contribute to revenue generation. We also adjust for net actuarial gains or losses associated with our pension and postemployment benefit plans due to the often-significant impact on our results (we immediately recognize this gain or loss in the income statement, pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses). Consequently, our adjusted results reflect an expected return on plan assets rather than the actual return on plan assets, as included in the GAAP measure of income. The tax impact of adjusting items is calculated using the effective tax rate during the quarter except for adjustments that, given their magnitude, can drive a change in the effective tax rate, in these cases, we use the actual tax expense or combined marginal rate of approximately 25%. For 4Q24 , adjusted EPS of $0.54 is diluted EPS of $0.56 adjusted for $0.01 of net actuarial loss and other benefit-related, transaction and other costs, minus $0.03 benefit from tax items. For 4Q23 , adjusted EPS of $0.54 is diluted EPS of $0.30 adjusted for $0.18 actuarial loss on benefit plans, $0.06 restructuring and impairments, $0.03 proportionate share of intangible amortization at the DIRECTV equity method investment, and $0.01 benefit-related, transaction and other costs, minus $0.04 benefit from tax items. For 2024 , adjusted EPS of $2.26 is diluted EPS of $1.49 adjusted for $0.72 restructuring and impairments, $0.09 proportionate share of intangible amortization at the DIRECTV equity method investment, and $0.01 actuarial loss on benefit plans, minus $0.03 benefit from tax items and $0.02 of benefit-related, transaction and other costs. For 2023 , adjusted EPS of $2.41 is diluted EPS of $1.97 adjusted for $0.18 restructuring and impairments, $0.17 net actuarial and settlement loss on benefit plans, and $0.14 proportionate share of intangible amortization at the DIRECTV equity method investment, minus $0.04 benefit from tax items and $0.01 of benefit-related, transaction and other costs. Beginning with reporting of first-quarter 2025 results, the company plans to revise its definition of adjusted EPS to remove the equity in net income from our investment in DIRECTV, which we have agreed to sell to TPG. For 2024, Adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV of $1.95 is diluted EPS of $1.49 adjusted for $0.72 restructuring and impairments, and $0.01 actuarial loss on benefit plans, minus $0.22 equity in net income of DIRECTV, $0.03 benefit from tax items and $0.02 of benefit-related, transaction and other costs. The Company expects adjustments to 2025 reported diluted EPS to include an adjustment to remove equity in net income of DIRECTV, a non-cash mark-to-market benefit plan gain/loss, and other items. The adjustment to remove the equity in net income of DIRECTV is dependent upon cash distributions from DIRECTV and the timing of the closing of the sale of our DIRECTV investment, which is expected in mid-2025. The Company expects the mark-to-market adjustment, which is driven by interest rates and investment returns that are not reasonably estimable at this time, to be a significant item. Our projected 2025 adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV depends on future levels of revenues and expenses, most of which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between this projected non-GAAP metric and the most comparable GAAP metric without unreasonable effort. Adjusted operating income is operating income adjusted for revenues and costs we consider non-operational in nature, including items arising from asset acquisitions or dispositions. For 4Q24 , adjusted operating income of $5.4 billion is calculated as operating income of $5.3 billion plus $0.1 billion of adjustments. For 4Q23 , adjusted operating income of $5.8 billion is calculated as operating income of $5.3 billion plus $0.5 billion of adjustments. For 2024 , adjusted operating income of $24.2 billion is calculated as operating income of $19.0 billion plus $5.2 billion of adjustments. For 2023 , adjusted operating income of $24.7 billion is calculated as operating income of $23.5 billion plus $1.2 billion of adjustments. Adjustments for all periods are detailed in the Discussion and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures included in our Form 8-K dated January 27, 2025 . EBITDA is net income plus income tax, interest, and depreciation and amortization expenses minus equity in net income of affiliates and other income (expense) \u2013 net. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from EBITDA certain significant items that are non-operational or non-recurring in nature, including dispositions and merger integration and transaction costs, significant abandonments and impairments, benefit-related gains and losses, employee separation and other material gains and losses.\u00a0Adjusted EBITDA, Mobility EBITDA, Business Wireline EBITDA and Consumer Wireline EBITDA\u00a0estimates depend on future levels of revenues and expenses which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide reconciliations between these projected non-GAAP metrics and the most comparable GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. For 4Q24 , adjusted EBITDA of $10.8 billion is calculated as net income of $4.4 billion , plus income tax expense of $0.9 billion , plus interest expense of $1.7 billion , minus equity in net income of affiliates of $1.1 billion , minus other income (expense) \u2013 net of $0.6 billion , plus depreciation and amortization of $5.4 billion , plus adjustments of $0.1 billion . For 4Q23 , adjusted EBITDA of $10.6 billion is calculated as net income of $2.6 billion , plus income tax expense of $0.4 billion , plus interest expense of $1.7 billion , minus equity in net income of affiliates of $0.3 billion , plus other income (expense) \u2013 net of $(0.9) billion , plus depreciation and amortization of $4.8 billion , plus adjustments of $0.5 billion . For 2024 , adjusted EBITDA of $44.8 billion is calculated as net income of $12.3 billion , plus income tax expense of $4.4 billion , plus interest expense of $6.8 billion , minus equity in net income of affiliates of $2.0 billion , minus other income (expense) \u2013 net of $2.4 billion , plus depreciation and amortization of $20.6 billion , plus adjustments of $5.1 billion . For 2023 , adjusted EBITDA of $43.4 billion is calculated as net income of $15.6 billion , plus income tax expense of $4.2 billion , plus interest expense of $6.7 billion , minus equity in net income of affiliates of $1.7 billion , minus other income (expense) \u2013 net of $1.4 billion , plus depreciation and amortization of $18.8 billion , plus adjustments of $1.2 billion . Adjustments for all periods are detailed in the Discussion and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures included in our Form 8-K dated January 27, 2025 . At the segment or business unit level, EBITDA is operating income before depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is operating income before depreciation and amortization, divided by total revenues. EBITDA service margin is operating income before depreciation and amortization, divided by total service revenues. Free cash flow for 4Q24 of $4.8 billion is cash from operating activities of $11.9 billion , minus capital expenditures of $6.8 billion and cash paid for vendor financing of $0.2 billion (there were no cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities in 4Q24).\u00a0For 4Q23 , free cash flow of $6.4 billion is cash from operating activities of $11.4 billion , plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $0.6 billion , minus capital expenditures of $4.6 billion and cash paid for vendor financing of $1.0 billion . For 2024 , free cash flow of $17.6 billion is cash from operating activities of $38.8 billion , plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $0.9 billion , minus capital expenditures of $20.3 billion and cash paid for vendor financing of $1.8 billion . For 2023 , free cash flow of $16.8 billion is cash from operating activities of $38.3 billion , plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $2.0 billion , minus capital expenditures of $17.9 billion and cash paid for vendor financing of $5.7 billion . Beginning with the reporting of first-quarter 2025 results, the Company plans to revise its definition of free cash flow to remove cash flows related to DIRECTV (distributions reported in both operating and investing activities). Free cash flow excluding DIRECTV is expected to be defined as cash from operations minus cash flows related to our DIRECTV equity method investment (cash distributions less cash taxes paid from DIRECTV), minus capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing (classified as financing activities). For 2024 , free cash flow excluding DIRECTV of $15.3 billion is cash from operating activities of $38.8 billion , less cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as operating activities of $2.0 billion , plus cash taxes paid on DIRECTV of $0.7 billion , minus capital expenditures of $20.3 billion and cash paid for vendor financing of $1.8 billion . Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash from operating activities, capital expenditures and vendor financing payments, the Company is not able to provide a reconciliation between projected free cash flow excluding DIRECTV and the most comparable GAAP metric without unreasonable effort. Capital investment provides a comprehensive view of cash used to invest in our networks, product developments and support systems. In connection with capital improvements, we have favorable payment terms of 120 days or more with certain vendors, referred to as vendor financing, which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported as financing activities. Capital investment includes capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing ( $0.2 billion in 4Q24, $1.0 billion in 4Q23, $1.8 billion in 2024, and $5.7 billion in 2023). Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact capital expenditures and vendor financing payments, the Company is not able to provide a reconciliation between projected capital investment and the most comparable GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. Adjusted equity in net income from DIRECTV investment of $2.8 billion for 2024 is calculated as equity income from DIRECTV of $2.0 billion reported in Equity in Net Income of Affiliates and excludes $0.8 billion of AT&T's proportionate share of the non-cash depreciation and amortization of fair value accretion from DIRECTV's revaluation of assets and purchase price allocation. Net debt of $120.1 billion at December 31, 2024 , is calculated as total debt of $123.5 billion less cash and cash equivalents of $3.3 billion and time deposits (i.e. deposits at financial institutions that are greater than 90 days) of $0.2 billion . Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA is calculated by dividing net debt by the sum of the most recent four quarters of adjusted EBITDA. Net debt and adjusted EBITDA are calculated as defined above. Net debt and adjusted EBITDA estimates depend on future levels of revenues, expenses and other metrics which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between projected net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA and the most comparable GAAP metrics and related ratios without unreasonable effort. Discussion and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures We believe the following measures are relevant and useful information to investors as they are part of AT&T's internal management reporting and planning processes and are important metrics that management uses to evaluate the operating performance of AT&T and its segments. Management also uses these measures as a method of comparing performance with that of many of our competitors. These measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations and cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities minus capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing (classified as financing activities). Free cash flow after dividends is defined as cash from operations and cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities, minus capital expenditures, cash paid for vendor financing and dividends on common and preferred shares. Free cash flow dividend payout ratio is defined as the percentage of dividends paid on common and preferred shares to free cash flow. We believe these metrics provide useful information to our investors because management views free cash flow as an important indicator of how much cash is generated by routine business operations, including capital expenditures and vendor financing, and from our continued economic interest in the U.S. video operations as part of our DIRECTV equity method investment, and makes decisions based on it. Management also views free cash flow as a measure of cash available to pay debt and return cash to shareowners.

For AT&T, EBITDA excludes other income (expense) \u2013 net, and equity in net income (loss) of affiliates, as these do not reflect the operating results of our subscriber base or operations that are not under our control. Equity in net income (loss) of affiliates represents the proportionate share of the net income (loss) of affiliates in which we exercise significant influence, but do not control. Because we do not control these entities, management excludes these results when evaluating the performance of our primary operations. EBITDA also excludes interest expense and the provision for income taxes. Excluding these items eliminates the expenses associated with our capital and tax structures. Finally, EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments. EBITDA does not give effect to cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses. EBITDA is not presented as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flows from operations, as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures are used by management as a gauge of our success in acquiring, retaining and servicing subscribers because we believe these measures reflect AT&T's ability to generate and grow subscriber revenues while providing a high level of customer service in a cost-effective manner. Management also uses these measures as a method of comparing cash generation potential with that of many of its competitors. The financial and operating metrics which affect EBITDA include the key revenue and expense drivers for which management is responsible and upon which we evaluate performance. We believe EBITDA Service Margin (EBITDA as a percentage of service revenues) to be a more relevant measure than EBITDA Margin (EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue) for our Mobility business unit operating margin. We also use wireless service revenues to calculate margin to facilitate comparison, both internally and externally with our wireless competitors, as they calculate their margins using wireless service revenues as well. There are material limitations to using these non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA, EBITDA margin and EBITDA service margin, as we have defined them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Furthermore, these performance measures do not take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense, tax expense and equity in net income (loss) of affiliates. For market comparability, management analyzes performance measures that are similar in nature to EBITDA as we present it, and considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with its analysis of net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA, EBITDA margin and EBITDA service margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.

While the expense associated with the amortization of certain wireless licenses and customer lists is excluded, the revenue of the acquired companies is reflected in the measure and that those assets contribute to revenue generation. We also adjust for net actuarial gains or losses associated with our pension and postemployment benefit plans due to the often-significant impact on our results (we immediately recognize this gain or loss in the income statement, pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses). Consequently, our adjusted results reflect an expected return on plan assets rather than the actual return on plan assets, as included in the GAAP measure of income. The tax impact of adjusting items is calculated using the effective tax rate during the quarter except for adjustments that, given their magnitude, can drive a change in the effective tax rate, in these cases we use the actual tax expense or combined marginal rate of approximately 25%.

Our Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio is calculated by dividing the Net Debt by the sum of the most recent four quarters Adjusted EBITDA. Net Debt is calculated by subtracting cash and cash equivalents and deposits at financial institutions that are greater than 90 days (e.g., certificates of deposit and time deposits), from the sum of debt maturing within one year and long-term debt.

Make You Over $4,700 in Passive Income in 2025 Keith Speights, The Motley Fool Sun, Jan 26, 2025, 1:46 PM 5 min read In This Article: DSL -0.47% BLK -5.74% What's a way to generate significant passive income that many investors don't know about? Closed-end funds (CEFs) . They're similar to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in that they trade like stocks on public exchanges. The main difference is that CEFs have a fixed number of shares whereas ETFs can issue new shares. If you're an income investor, CEFs might be especially attractive. There are many funds from which to choose, but a few stand out to me. Investing $10,000 into each of these CEFs could make you over $4,700 in passive income in 2025. 1. AllianceBernstein Global High Income Fund The \"high income\" in the AllianceBernstein Global High Income Fund 's (NYSE: AWF) name isn't just marketing hype. This CEF offers a distribution yield of 6.9%. An initial investment of $10,000 in the fund should generate $690 in passive income this year based on that yield. This CEF invests mainly in corporate debt securities. Most of its portfolio is in lower-rated corporate bonds (which generate higher yields), but the fund's holdings can also include investment-grade corporate bonds, government bonds, and other assets. The AllianceBernstein Global High Income Fund currently has 1,218 holdings. 2. BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund The BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund (NYSE: DSU) pays an especially juicy distribution yield of 11.04%. If you bought $10,000 worth of the fund's shares, you'd likely receive income in the ballpark of $1,104 in 2025. Instead of bonds, this CEF primarily invests in other corporate debt instruments -- mainly corporate loans. Some (although not all) of these loans are secured by assets pledged as collateral. This generally makes them safer to invest in than other types of corporate debt. 3. Cohen & Steers Infrastructure Fund The Cohen & Steers Infrastructure Fund (NYSE: UTF) attempts to generate income by investing in stocks and debt issued by infrastructure companies. It currently has 252 holdings with top positions including five energy and utility stocks: NextEra Energy , NiSource , TC Energy , PPL , and Duke Energy . This CEF's distribution yield stands at 7.63%. An initial investment of $10,000 should enable you to rake in around $763 in passive income this year. 4. DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund The DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund (NYSE: DSL) has two goals: (1) provide a high level of income, and (2) deliver capital appreciation. It's definitely achieving the first goal these days with a distribution yield of 10.48%. Investing $10,000 in the CEF should give you income of roughly $1,048 in 2025. Story Continues This CEF is managed by Jeffrey Gundlach, who some call the \"Bond King.\" Unsurprisingly, the fund invests primarily in bonds, most of which are below investment grade. The DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund's holdings also include asset-backed securities, bank loans, and collateralized loan obligations. 5. Pimco Dynamic Income Opportunities Fund I've saved the biggest passive income generator for last. The Pimco Dynamic Income Opportunities Fund (NYSE: PDO) pays a distribution yield of 11.2%. Buying $10,000 worth of the fund's shares should make you $1,120 in income this year. Like the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund, the Pimco Dynamic Income Opportunities Fund focuses primarily on delivering income and secondarily on capital appreciation. This CEF's holdings include non-agency mortgages, U.S. government bonds, and high-yield credit assets. Four things to know about these CEFs Could investing $10,000 in each of the above CEFs really make you over $4,700 in passive income this year? Absolutely. However, there are four things income investors should know about them. First, the actual amount of income you receive could be lower than $4,700. It's possible that one or more of these funds could reduce their distributions in the coming months. On the other hand, some or all of them could also increase their distributions. Second, the share prices of these CEFs could be volatile. As is the case with investing in stocks and ETFs, investing in CEFs could entail losses. That said, several of these funds have delivered impressive total returns over the last year. Third, unlike most ETFs, CEFs often use leverage. For example, the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund's leverage from borrowing is 22.05%. The use of leverage can boost income generated but can also cause losses to be greater. Fourth, these CEFs have greater annual expenses than many ETFs do. The funds' managers charge hefty fees for delivering such juicy distributions. For example, the BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund's gross expense ratio is 2.47%. The good news, though, is the yields discussed earlier are net of any expenses.

Data Solution for Brightspeed's Copper Customers PR Newswire Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 5:17 PM 3 min read Brightspeed leverages Verizon's network to provide dependable, high-speed connectivity option for customers on aging copper networks CHARLOTTE, N.C. , Jan. 22, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Brightspeed, an innovative telecommunications and internet service provider and the nation's third largest fiber broadband builder, announced the launch of a program offering its unique fixed wireless voice and data solution using Verizon's network for customers currently served by aging copper cables. This agreement with Verizon positions Brightspeed as a leader in the industry and moves the company closer to helping close the digital divide across its 20-state footprint. (PRNewsfoto/Brightspeed) \"Brightspeed developed this industry-leading fixed wireless solution that can support voice calls and help families and businesses connect to the internet, fully participating in today's digital world,\" said Brightspeed Chief Technology Officer, Brian Bond . \"Now, Verizon is partnering with us to launch the solution by enabling the use of its network to provide the services our customers depend on every day \u2014 a reliable way to reach family and friends and a high-speed internet connection needed for remote work, online education, telehealth and teleconferencing.\" \"Connectivity is essential in nearly every part of our lives and work,\" said Jeff Hulse , President, Verizon Partner Solutions. \"Working with Brightspeed, we are connecting more people, providing them with solutions necessary to create a fully connected nation.\" Brightspeed is making a multi-billion-dollar investment in deploying its state-of-the-art fiber broadband network across its service areas in the South, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. to replace aging copper telecommunications infrastructure. However, the deployment of Brightspeed's fiber network to more than four million homes and businesses will take time and can't fully cover the nearly seven million locations across its footprint. Working with Verizon, this new fixed wireless voice and data solution offers customers a more immediate, reliable, high-speed connectivity option and can be deployed to homes and businesses that Brightspeed's planned fiber broadband network build may not reach. \"Ultimately, our goal is to give every home and business within our 20-state service area a more reliable, resilient option\u00a0 over copper voice and data services,\" said Brightspeed CEO Tom Maguire . \"Everyone deserves the latest and best communications technology available. Archaic copper networks are costly to maintain, susceptible to weather-related issues and can neither support modern technology nor telecommunications innovation and the needs of the future. This fixed wireless solution will help those who have struggled with unreliable copper service living in areas where our fiber network isn't available.\" Story Continues Currently, some Brightspeed DSL customers in underserved or unserved areas are getting speeds well below what is needed to productively work, learn or stream online and are repeatedly dealing with service outages due to copper's lack of resiliency. Brightspeed's new fixed wireless voice and data solution using Verizon's network will provide customers with reliable connectivity. This new fixed wireless voice and data solution will upgrade services for some current Brightspeed DSL customers. Brightspeed ensures a smooth, hassle-free installation, backed by easy-to-understand billing and simple plans that make getting connected stress-free: no annual contracts, equipment costs, bundle requirements, data caps, or surprise fees. About Brightspeed Headquartered in Charlotte, N.C. and with assets and associated operations in 20 states, Brightspeed provides broadband and telecommunications services through a network platform capable of serving more than 6.5 million homes and businesses. Our 4,000 employees are committed to building a future where more communities benefit from a more connected life, deploying a state-of-the-art fiber network and a customer experience that makes being connected as simple as it should be.

2025, 2:40 AM 9 min read In This Article: CAUD 0.00% Company Reiterates Outlook for Q3, Q4 and Full Year 2024 NEW YORK, NY / ACCESS Newswire / January 16, 2025 / Collective Audience, Inc. (OTC PINK:CAUD), a leading innovator of audience-based performance advertising and media for the open web, reports that the public trading of its common stock has transitioned from the OTCQB to the Expert Market as the company works to complete its filing on Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2024. The filing delay is due to the U.S. GAAP accounting for the company's third quarter acquisition of France-based BeOp, as well as the company's recent change of independent auditors. Given the change in auditors and to help ensure a regular reporting cycle going forward, the auditors and the company's audit committee review has also included a thorough financial evaluation of the first and second quarter of 2024 which were reported post de-SPAC. BeOp has been a transformative acquisition for the company, providing the advanced AdTech cloud platform technology that is now powering its AudienceCloud infrastructure for advertising on the Open Web. BeOp's expert teams, based in France (Paris/Montpellier) and New York City, work with more than 90% of France's premium publishers. Media customers include more than 200 premium global publishers across the UK, North America and Australia, with more than 50 million unique visitors per month. BeOp's customers include Range Rover, Tommy Hilfiger, Samsung, Addidas, Coca Cola, Forbes, Ford, Audi, Hyundai, Yoplait, L'Or\u00e9al, Club Med, the International Olympic Committee, and Paramount. The company's delayed Q3 filing resulted in the operator of the OTCQB stock market, The OTC Markets Group, moving the trading of the company's common stock to its Expert Market Tier. The OTC Markets Group has extended to Collective Audience a grace period which will allow it to quickly return to the higher-tier OTCQB soon after the company becomes current in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company anticipates the Q3 filing to be ready for submission within the next seven days, dependent on the completion of the filing's review by the company's independent accounting firm. \"We very much appreciate the patience and support of our shareholders as we work through the complexities of this transformative acquisition and set a strong financial foundation going forward,\" stated Collective Audience CEO, Peter Bordes. \"These efforts are very important, given the increasing momentum for growth we've gained from our new partnerships and acquisitions. We believe we have entered a pivotal stage in our growth trajectory, where we are able to benefit from the major changes underway in our industry and capitalize on new opportunities.\" Story Continues New regulatory changes, such as the FCC TCPA one-to-one consent rule related to lead generation and consumer privacy, are expected to uniquely benefit Collective Audience. The company's audience cloud capabilities enable brands to connect directly with consumers and route their data directly to the CRM or DMP (data management platform) of brands or publishers. These unique capabilities position Collective Audience to become the go-to provider of audience-based performance advertising and media platform for the open web. As the company begins the new year, it is preparing to launch several new products, including a full programmatic layer integration enabling all trading desks to access AudienceDesk's direct publisher inventory. It is also preparing to launch a new VAST video advertising channel for interactive in-stream YouTube or video ad units that enable video ad experiences . \"We have received very positive preliminary data from the testing our new offerings with the FDA, with a 3x gain in the traditional performance and 80% completion rates with audience participants interacting with our video ads,\" noted Bordes. \"We look forward to sharing more on these new next generation products over the coming weeks, with this part of a very robust product release roadmap that extends throughout the year.\" \"As our financial team and auditors work to finalize our Q3 10-Q, our operational teams remain focused on executing our corporate development roadmap and signing significant new business,\" added Bordes. \"These activities also include the full integration and optimization of our new global operations, technologies, and products in preparation for our anticipated organic and acquisitive growth in 2025.\" Outlook Based upon Collective Audience's acquisitions in 2024 and the subsequent growth in client campaign bookings, the company reiterates its expectations to report a record full-year 2024 pro forma revenue and positive pro forma adjusted EBITDA. The company also still expects to report record third quarter 2024 pro forma revenue of approximately $1.8 million, up 65% from the previous quarter. The growth will be driven primarily by the contribution of two transformative acquisitions, DSL Digital and BeOp, and their accelerating growth post-acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter is still expected to total a loss of approximately $92,000, an 88% improvement from the previous quarter. The company also anticipates reporting further gains in revenue and adjusted EBITDA performance in the fourth quarter of 2024. These results would be in line with the company's outlook of $7.5 million in revenue and positive adjusted EBITDA on a pro forma basis which it provided earlier in 2024. In addition to BeOp, in July Collective Audience acquired the marketing-as-a-service provider, DSL Digital. DSL brought to Collective Audience multi-million-dollar annual profitable revenues being generated by a global services team and proprietary Copycraft AI technology. Collective Audience's positive expectations are supported by major new bookings with Fortune 1000 clients and major brands valued at more than $2.2 million in Q4 2024.

Internet services in the Far North CNW Group Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 12:00 AM 2 min read OTTAWA, ON and\u00a0GATINEAU, QC , Jan. 16, 2025 /CNW/ - Today, the CRTC is taking a major step forward to help make Internet services more reliable and affordable\u00a0for residents of the Far North. Following a robust, multi-phase public consultation that engaged Far North residents, businesses, Indigenous communities\u00a0and other groups, the CRTC is announcing three key actions to help improve services in the region. First, the CRTC is requiring Northwestel Inc. (Northwestel), the region's largest service provider, to automatically reduce customers' bills when Internet services are disrupted for 24 hours or more. These credits will help address the impact of network outages on residents' daily lives. Second, the CRTC is making it easier for other Internet service providers to use Northwestel's network to sell services to customers. This will help foster competition and provide more choice in the Far North. Third, the CRTC is launching a public consultation to develop a subsidy to help improve affordability. This subsidy will help bring the cost of Internet services in the Far North closer to those in other parts of the country. The CRTC is\u00a0accepting comments until February 18, 2025 . Interested persons can participate by: filling out the online form ; sharing views on the CRTC Conversations platform ; writing to the Secretary General, CRTC, Ottawa , K1A 0N2; or sending a fax to 819-994-0218. All comments received will form part of the public record and will inform the CRTC's decision. First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis peoples and organizations requiring assistance submitting comments, including oral interventions, can contact the\u00a0CRTC's Indigenous Relations Team . Quotes \"Throughout our consultation, we heard about the challenges that residents of the Far North face in accessing Internet services and the real impact that has on peoples' daily lives. From disruptions in online learning, to the inability to access healthcare and emergency services. Today, we are taking action to help address those challenges by making Internet services more reliable and affordable.\" - Vicky Eatrides , Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer, CRTC Quick facts The CRTC is an independent quasi-judicial tribunal that regulates the Canadian communications sector in the public interest.

Jan 8, 2025, 5:00 PM 4 min read New Product Offerings Provide Actionable Insight and More Realistic Construction Cost Estimates SOMERSET, N.J. , Jan. 8, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- VCTI , the broadband expansion and network technology experts, today announced a 75 percent win rate for grant applications submitted by clients, totaling more than $45M in federal and state awards for broadband expansion during Q4. These client successes contributed to VCTI's 20 percent growth this year. VCTI's base of service provider customers includes the nation's largest service providers, rural utility cooperatives, small and mid-sized fixed wireless and fiber operators, privately funded, highly aggressive overbuilders, and private equity firms and investment bankers seeking greater accuracy in the assessment of service provider market opportunity. VCTI (PRNewsfoto/VCTI) Client results and revenue growth were driven by the company's new AI-powered tool to assess aerial and underground deployment options, Fiber IQ\u2122 , and its Address Integrity Mapping (AIM) service. Given service providers' continued focus on broadband expansion in the BEAD era, VCTI's suite of automated intelligence solutions and services help customers make better, more accurate investment decisions earlier in the planning process without reliance on sending teams out into the field. This enables service providers to expand their networks to serve more people at lower cost, with greater speed, intelligence, and accuracy, while providing investors with greater confidence in the business plan projections. \"The broadband sector is racing to deliver broadband to the underserved, and to stake a claim to territories as competitors and incumbents battle it out for market share,\" explained VCTI CEO Raj Singh. \"In the past, service providers planning to expand their networks needed to focus on either speed or accuracy when building the business case, but in today's hyper-competitive environment, that tradeoff no longer works. We've built solutions that use data, analytics, and the latest technologies to take the guesswork out of network build plans and prioritization by delivering BOTH speed and accuracy early in the process.\" AI Powered Intelligence In 2024, VCTI introduced Fiber IQ\u2122, a new offering allowing service providers to obtain highly accurate broadband cost estimates early and quickly in the business planning process. Fiber IQ is powered by two solutions \u2013 Pole IQ \u2122 and Geology IQ \u2122 \u2013 that utilize AI to provide crucial insights into aerial and underground broadband deployment options and their respective cost implications without sending teams into the field for visual inspections. In recognition of the immense value Fiber IQ delivers, the product was awarded an ISE Network Innovators Award \u2013 Gold Level. Story Continues VCTI also introduced Address Integrity Mapping (AIM), another AI-powered service that helps broadband providers correct omissions in their systems, identifying untapped serviceable locations within the service provider's existing serviceable market. Using AIM with one service provider,\u00a0VCTI identified a 3.5 percent increase in households within immediate reach of the existing network, translating into an increased market potential of $68 million annually. In some cases, AIM has increased the number of serviceable addresses across a providers' network by six percent or more. The private equity and capital markets are taking note of VCTI's solutions and leveraging them to protect their investments. During 2024, VCTI was selected by a private equity firm to assess the business plan and market potential of a service provider seeking a $200 million investment to expand its market share. Partnerships and Executive Team Growth During Q4, VCTI and Amdocs , a leading provider of software and services to communications and media companies, signed a Value-Added Reseller Agreement. Amdocs intends to include VCTI's AIM solution as additional potential value to its robust BSS/OSS products. VCTI also expanded its executive team. Tom Smith has joined the company as Senior Vice President of Sales. Tom is a seasoned sales and business development leader with over 25 years of experience in telecom and networking technology. He has worked with public, private, and VC/PE-backed companies focused on building wireline and wireless networks for consumer and business IP communications. Tom began his career at MCI Telecom (now Verizon Business) and has been instrumental in advancing broadband technologies, including fiber, DSL, cable, wireless, IoT, and smart city solutions. About VCTI VCTI offers a suite of SaaS-based applications that unlock the potential of service providers' broadband expansion investments. The Company uses cutting-edge data analytics to pinpoint regions with strong growth and ROI potential, while uncovering hidden opportunity within the existing footprint. This allows service providers to make business decisions quickly and decisively. A trusted partner to the most respected and innovative broadband and technology companies globally, VCTI is a privately held, global company headquartered in the US with offices in India .

in His Second Term? PR Newswire Tue, Jan 7, 2025, 5:00 PM 2 min read In This Article: DSL -0.47% TAMPA, Fla. , Jan. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- While the upcoming launch of Trump 2.0 has generated a lot of public speculation about the incoming administration's policies on immigration, tax cuts and tariffs, another area of policy focus from President Trump's first term could be revived:\u00a0reprivatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In a new research paper, DoubleLine Portfolio Manager Kunal Patel , CFA, and Analyst Alex Shvartser take a look at the history of the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) under conservatorship, the challenging pathway to reprivatization and such a move's impact on the Agency mortgage-backed securities market. DoubleLine Logo (PRNewsfoto/DoubleLine) The research paper, \"Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities: Fannie and Freddie Private Again Under Trump 2.0?,\" can be accessed here: https://doubleline.com/wp-content/uploads/AgencyMBS-Privatization-of-Fannie_Freddie_Jan2025.pdf . \"Privatizing the GSEs, if pursued, would be a massive and complex project that would take multiple years and likely require coordination among all three branches of government,\" Messrs. Patel and Shvartser write. \"While privatization has significant risks and unclear political or economic upside relative to the status quo, it is certainly possible, and there is a good chance parts of it will be attempted at some point by the incoming administration, which might be a catalyst for sporadic volatility in the Agency mortgage-backed securities market.\" Kunal Patel , CFA, is a Portfolio Manager on DoubleLine's Structured Products team.

Declares January 2025 Distribution PR Newswire Thu, Jan 2, 2025, 5:10 PM 6 min read In This Article: DSL -0.47% TAMPA, Fla. , Jan. 2, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund (the \"Fund\"), which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol DSL, this week declared a distribution of $0.11 per share for the month of January 2025 . The distributions are subject to the following ex-dividend, record and payment dates set by the Fund's Board of Trustees. DoubleLine Logo (PRNewsfoto/DoubleLine) January 2025 Declaration Thursday, Jan. 2, 2025 Ex-Dividend Wednesday, Jan. 15, 2025 Record Wednesday, Jan. 15, 2025 Payment Friday, Jan. 31, 2025 This press release is not for tax reporting purposes. The press release has been issued to announce the amount and timing of the distributions declared by the Board of Trustees. There is a possibility that distributions may include ordinary income, long-term capital gains or return of capital. For information on whether the distribution includes a return of capital, please contact us on or after the distribution payment date. The amount of distributable income and the tax characteristics of the distributions are determined at the end of the taxable year. In early 2026, the Fund will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV specifying how the distributions paid by the Fund during the prior calendar year should be characterized for purposes of reporting the distributions on a shareholder's tax return. About DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek high current income; its secondary objective is to seek capital appreciation. The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objectives by investing in a portfolio of investments selected for their potential to provide high current income, growth of capital, or both. DoubleLine Capital LP (\"DoubleLine\"), the Fund's investment adviser, expects that the Fund will normally invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in debt securities and other income-producing investments anywhere in the world, including emerging markets. The Fund may invest in mortgage-backed securities of any kind and may invest without limit in securities rated below investment grade (commonly referred to as \"high yield\" securities or \"junk bonds\"). There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investing in the Fund involves the risk of principal loss.

Investors should consider the Fund's investment objective, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. An investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program. Investors should note that the Fund only can be obtained through a broker. This document is not an offer to sell securities or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities, nor shall there be any sale or offer of these securities, in any jurisdiction where such sale or offer is not permitted. Fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value, which may increase investors' risk of loss. This risk may be greater for investors expecting to sell their shares in a relatively short period after the completion of the public offering. There are risks associated with investment in the fund. Investments in debt securities typically decline in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investments in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities include additional risks that investors should be aware of including credit risk, prepayment risk, possible illiquidity and default, as well as increased susceptibility to adverse economic developments. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The fund may invest in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater for investments in emerging markets. Investments in lower rated and non-rated securities present a great risk of loss to principal and interest than higher rated securities. Investment strategies may not achieve the desired results due to implementation lag, other timing factors, portfolio management decisions-making, economic or market conditions or other unanticipated factors. In addition, the Fund may invest in other asset classes and investments such as, among others, REITs, credit default swaps, short sales, derivatives and smaller companies which include additional risks. The DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund (the \"Fund\") is a diversified, closed-end management investment company.

The views expressed herein (including any forward-looking statement) may not be relied upon as investment advice or as an indication of the Fund's trading intent.

A Fund's Section 19a-1 Notice, if applicable, contains additional distribution composition information and may be obtained by visiting www.doubleline.com . Final determination of a distribution's tax character will be made on Form 1099 DIV and sent to shareholders. On a tax basis, as of Dec. 31, 2024 , the estimated component of the cumulative distribution for the fiscal year to date would include an estimated return of capital of $0.034 (10%) per share. This amount is an estimate and the actual amounts and sources for tax reporting purposes may change upon final determination of tax characteristics and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations.
