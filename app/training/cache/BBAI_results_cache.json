[{"text": "Why BigBear.ai Stock Jumped This Week Keith Noonan, The Motley Fool Sun, Jan 26, 2025, 1:12 AM 3 min read BigBear.ai (NYSE: BBAI) stock posted big gains across the last week of trading. The software company's share price closed out the stretch up 5.4%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence . Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index gained 1.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 1.6%. In addition to bullish momentum for the broader market, BigBear.ai stock posted gains in conjunction with moves made by President Trump. In his first week back in office, Trump rescinded a Biden-era executive order on artificial intelligence (AI)\u00a0and issued his own order for the technology category. BigBear.ai stock climbs on Trump AI moves President Trump's inauguration was held on Jan. 20, and the new president kicked off his new term in office by rescinding an executive order enacted during the Biden administration governing the progression of AI. By canceling Biden's executive order on AI, Trump removed the need for private companies to report details about AI development to the federal government. Revoking the order also eliminated the need for private companies to ensure their AI initiatives were in line with a series of other guidelines outlined during the Biden administration. Trump followed up the move on Thursday by issuing his own executive order on AI, which the president said was intended to remove barriers to domestic AI innovation. The order has formed an advisory group that will put forth an AI action plan within 180 days. As part of Trump's new order, \"all policies, directives, regulations, orders, and other actions taken\" regarding AI under the Biden administration will also be reviewed. Investors broadly see Trump's approach as creating a more favorable growth backdrop for AI, and it helped power significant gains for BigBear.ai stock this week. On the other hand, the company's share price did see a pullback later in the week in conjunction with fluctuations in the broader market and insider selling disclosures. Shares had been up as much as 17.1% from the previous week's market close, but gains moderated due to these factors. What comes next for BigBear.ai? BigBear.ai recently named Kevin McAleenan its new CEO. Some investors are hoping his experience with the previous Trump administration and working with U.S. national security agencies will help the company land more contracts. BigBear.ai's management had previously noted that it was seeing some hesitance from government customers when it came to AI spending. It's possible that new leadership will strengthen the company's ability to land deals with key public sector customers. But the stock is also up 123% over the last year and is looking riskier on the heels of those gains.

Zacks Equity Research Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 5:30 PM 4 min read In This Article: BBAI -0.24% BBAI-WS Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter? Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc. (BBAI) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage. BigBear.ai currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.50, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by four brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.50 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy. Of the four recommendations that derive the current ABR, three are Strong Buy, representing 75% of all recommendations. Brokerage Recommendation Trends for BBAI Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for BBAI Check price target & stock forecast for BigBear.ai here>>> The ABR suggests buying BigBear.ai, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation. Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations. This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision. ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures. The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5. Story Continues It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them. On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns. Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements. Is BBAI Worth Investing In? Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for BigBear.ai, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at -$0.75. Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for BigBear.ai.

{"text": "Prediction: 2 AI Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than BigBear.ai 2 Years From Now Leo Sun, The Motley Fool Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 1:25 PM 5 min read In This Article: UBER +0.66% INOD -0.92% BigBear.ai 's (NYSE: BBAI) stock price has rallied about 120% over the past 12 months, but it's still trading nearly 70% below its all-time high from April 2022. The AI software developer bounced back as its revenue growth stabilized and its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( EBITDA ) improved. Many of its investors initially fled when its revenue growth flatlined in 2023 as it struggled with macroeconomic headwinds, tough competition, and the bankruptcy of its major customer Virgin Orbit. But under Mandy Long, a former IBM executive who took over as its CEO in late 2022, it stabilized its business by acquiring the AI vision firm Pangiam in an all-stock takeover, securing new government contracts, and trimming its workforce. It also secured more data-sharing deals for its AI analytics modules, which can be directly plugged into an organization's existing software and edge networks. Image source: Getty Images. For 2024, analysts expect BigBear.ai's revenue to grow 8% to $168 million with a negative adjusted EBITDA of $1 million. For 2025, they expect its revenue to rise 14% to $193 million with a positive adjusted EBITDA of $5 million under Kevin McAleenan, Pangiam's founder who recently succeeded Mandy Long as BigBear.ai's new CEO. But with enterprise value of $1.13 billion, BigBear.ai stock isn't cheap at 6 times its projected sales for 2025. So instead of wondering if it can keep growing into its rising valuations, investors should check out two smaller AI stocks that might become even more valuable over the next two years: Innodata (NASDAQ: INOD) and Serve Robotics (NASDAQ: SERV) . Innodata Innodata, an analytics company that went public in 1993, was once considered a slow-growth underdog in a crowded market. But all that changed when it launched a suite of task-specific microservices for preparing data for AI applications in 2018. When a large company develops a new AI project, it can spend 80% of its time preparing the data and just 20% of the time training the AI algorithm. That's an inefficient use of time for companies that are constantly feeding massive amounts of data into their large language models (LLMs) and other AI tools. To streamline that process, five of the Magnificent Seven companies started to use Innodata's new AI microservices to clean up their data. As a result, Innodata's revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12% from 2019 to 2023. But as the booming AI market expands, analysts expect its revenue to rise at an even faster CAGR of 42% from 2023 to 2026. They also expect it to turn profitable in 2024 and grow its earnings per share at a CAGR of 21% over the following two years. Story Continues That incredible acceleration makes it one of the market's fastest-growing AI stocks. But with an enterprise value of $1.07 billion, it still trades at less than 5 times its 2025 sales. As more growth-oriented AI investors start paying attention to Innodata, it could easily outperform BigBear.ai and eclipse its enterprise value within the next two years. Serve Robotics Serve Robotics, a developer of autonomous delivery robots, was founded in 2017 within Postmates, the food delivery service that was acquired by Uber Technologies in 2020. Uber spun off Serve in 2021, but it continued to use its delivery robots for Uber Eats in select areas of Los Angeles. Its newest Gen 3 robots can travel at a max speed of 11 mph, last up to 48 miles on a single charge, and carry 15 gallons of cargo. They're also resistant to heavy rain and extreme temperatures. Serve owns a fleet of 100 robots, but it only operated 59 active robots across the L.A. area for Uber Eats in the third quarter of 2024. It went public through a reverse merger with a blank-check company in 2023, but it's barely generating any revenue. For the full year, analysts expect Serve to generate just $1.9 million in revenue with a net loss of $34.3 million. So at first glance, it might seem absurd that Serve has an enterprise value of $803 million -- or 423 times its estimated sales for 2024. However, it could scale up its business over the next few years. Uber Eats plans to deploy up to 2,000 of Serve's robots across the L.A. and Dallas-Fort Worth metro areas in 2025. If it achieves that ambitious expansion, analysts expect its revenue to surge to $59.5 million in 2026. Based on that forecast, Serve doesn't seem extremely expensive at 13 times its 2026 sales -- so its enterprise value might just surpass BigBear.ai's over the next two years as Uber Eats rolls out more of its delivery robots.
