[{"text": "Elastic N.V. (ESTC): Advancing Generative AI with AWS Partnership and LLM Innovations Usman Kabir Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 8:15 PM 6 min read In This Article: ESTC -0.94% We recently compiled a list of the 35 Most Important AI Stocks for 2025 According to JPMorgan . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) stands against the other AI stocks. Investors have become increasingly concerned about the rising capital expenditures on artificial intelligence, with many wondering whether the expectations embedded in financial markets today project a realistic path ahead. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan,\u00a0 investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega-cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now makes up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and has driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on a 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x.

Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes. JPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. Hardware firms were defined as the companies that drive the design and manufacture of the semiconductors that are key to generating computing power. Hyperscalers were picked out as the companies that provide physical AI infrastructure such as cloud services and data centers, create custom silicon chips, and build large language models that can be used by other companies. AI developers were recognized as software companies that leverage hyperscaler technologies to provide solutions for end users.

AI integrators were pinned down as the larger organizations that have sufficient technology functionality to build their own AI solutions, as well as the IT services companies that support them. AI essentials were singled out as companies that are less directly impacted by the technology itself, but provide the resources that enable the whole AI value chain to work, whether that is energy, air conditioning, raw materials or even the data to train models. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility. The report further highlights that these categories are also likely to be the most exposed to escalating trade tensions between the US and China. The bank predicts ample opportunities for investors in the AI essentials and AI developers bucket over time.

stocks: Citi Investing.com Tue, Jan 28, 2025, 12:20 PM 3 min read In This Article: MSFT -1.00% ADBE +0.26% Investing.com -- The breakthrough in AI technology by Chinese startup DeekSeek's r1 model has the potential to benefit the software sector, Citi analysts said. DeepSeek's \"test-time scaling law\" achieves AI efficiency at a fraction of the cost compared to OpenAI. This raised questions about the sky-high capital expenditures (capex) across hyperscalers including the recently announced Stargate Investment, and led to a sharp sell-off in global technology stocks. However, according to Citi, the breakthrough could potentially mark a pivotal moment for AI-enabled software applications. Citi likens DeepSeek's advancement to the way public cloud technology once democratized access to affordable computing power. The Wall Street firm is particularly optimistic about companies focused on consumption, such as MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB), Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), Elastic (NYSE:ESTC), and Confluent Inc (NASDAQ:CFLT), where increased AI efficiency could lead to higher application and query usage. ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is also seen as a beneficiary as it is the first to market with an AI product that offers firmer seat-based pricing. The implications for larger tech companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are mixed. While Microsoft has exposure to OpenAI, it is not perceived as a structural threat due to the company's disciplined capex, especially in the context of the recent Stargate investment. \u201cMSFT also is a beneficiary of AI applications across Enterprises (CoPilot etc.), and rapid model efficiency gains could deliver significant margin improvement ahead should capital intensity be pared back faster than expected,\u201d analysts added. Meanwhile, Citi analysts voiced caution regarding software giant Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), which may face efficiency and return questions on its AI infrastructure investments with OpenAI. In consumption software, the efficiency gains from DeepSeek's model are seen as potentially transformative, driving a significant increase in AI adoption. This could lead to an uptick in inferencing workloads for data platform players. One company expected to witness a surge in demand for its AI products is Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR), according to Citi. \u201cPalantir\u2019s AIP has seen tremendous uptake with customers, and we do see the model breakthrough as potentially driving an increase in demand,\u201d the firm said. The collaboration and e-signature companies are also positioned to benefit. Citi highlights DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU), Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM), and Nice Ltd ADR (NASDAQ:NICE). These companies are expected to achieve better returns on investment due to more efficient AI models, which can be integrated into their products without additional costs. Story Continues In the vertical software space, companies like Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), ANSYS (NASDAQ:ANSS), PTC (NASDAQ:PTC), CCC (WA:CCCP) Intelligent Solutions, Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV), and Tenable Holdings (NASDAQ:TENB) are in the early stages of AI adoption. \u201cThe r1 model is generally positive for vertical software peers with the results showing similar performance to OpenAIs o1 but at a lower cost which should spur accelerated adoption of AI workflows where peers shied away from higher compute task because of cost considerations,\u201d Citi explained. Finally, front-office software providers such as Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS), and ZoomInfo Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:ZI) are also seen as beneficiaries of the DeepSeek model efficiency. However, the emergence of more efficient open-source models may increase competition, particularly for ZoomInfo's market and Adobe's lower-end offerings.

"Elastic N.V. (ESTC) Sees Neutral Rating Amid AI Growth Potential Ghazal Ahmed Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 7:02 AM 4 min read In This Article: ESTC -0.94% We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street\u2019s Radar . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) stands against other AI stocks on Wall Street\u2019s radar. With OpenAI having started the AI arms race through its groundbreaking advancements, there are no signs that the AI startup may stop any time soon. In its latest, the company said on Tuesday, January 14, that it is introducing a beta feature called Tasks to ChatGPT. The move is said to highlight the company\u2019s entry into the virtual assistant space, competing with Apple\u2019s Siri and Amazon\u2019s Alexa. Through Tasks, ChatGPT users will be able to request tasks to be performed at a future time, including one-time reminders. This includes tasks such as fetching daily weather updates or even news briefings. READ NOW: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 10 Must-Watch AI Stocks on Investors\u2019 Radar ChatGPT maker OpenAI also revealed that it has finalized a version of its new reasoning AI model o3 mini. According to CEO Sam Altman, the finalized version will be launched in a couple of weeks. Altman further wrote in a post on social media platform X that the company has listened to user feedback, and will be releasing the application programming interface (API) and ChatGPT simultaneously. OpenAI plans to launch the o3 mini by the end of January, and the full o3 afterwards. This move may be because there may be robust large language models that could outperform existing models and attract new investments and users. Currently, the o1 models are capable of reasoning through complex tasks. According to the company, they can solve more challenging problems than previous models in science, coding, and math. While OpenAI is racing toward reaching the next levels in AI outpacing its competitors, it is just as much concerned about the country\u2019s policy toward it. The company has recently laid out an economic blueprint with its vision for artificial intelligence in the US. \u201cChips, data, and energy are the keys to winning AI\u201d, it said. It also said that the U.S. needs to act now to craft nationwide rules that will help secure its advantage. \u201cThere\u2019s an estimated $175 billion sitting in global funds awaiting investment in AI projects, and if the U.S. doesn\u2019t attract those funds, they will flow to China-backed projects \u2014strengthening the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s global influence\u201d. The company has also outlined proposals for export controls on AI models. According to them, adversary nations should be unable to access them as they are more likely to misuse the technology. Story Continues After raising $6.6 billion last year, the company plans to turn itself into a for-profit business so that it can capture even more funds to stay ahead in the AI race. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Elastic N.V. (ESTC) Sees Neutral Rating Amid AI Growth Potential A group of software engineers working in an open, futuristic office. Elastic N.V. (NYSE: ESTC ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47 Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) is a search AI company offering cloud-based solutions. On January 17, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Thomas Blakey initiated coverage of 18 names in infrastructure and artificial intelligence software, one of which is Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC). The firm initiated coverage of Elastic (ESTC) Company with a \u201cNeutral\u201d rating and a $108 price target. The analysts told investors in a research note that the value proposition of infrastructure software is going to increase further, driven by the ongoing secular expansion of AI and generative AI. These trends \u201cfuel the need\u201d for observable infrastructure, unified, secure, and highly integrated data systems, real-time computing and networking capabilities, and enhanced workflows and collaboration. Increased usage and consumption are likely going to drive the monetization of artificial intelligence. Overall, ESTC ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on Wall Street\u2019s radar. While we acknowledge the potential of ESTC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Next 5 Years? Maham Fatima Sat, Jan 18, 2025, 10:14 PM 6 min read In This Article: ESTC -0.94% We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for the Next 5 Years . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Elastic NV (NYSE:ESTC) stands against the other growth stocks. Kevin Mahn, President & CIO at Hennion & Walsh Asset Management, recently appeared on CNBC on January 6 to discuss the current market momentum and emphasize the need for investors to be selective in 2025 to find growth opportunities. He highlighted that while the MAG7 have led the market recently, their leadership may not continue. Mahn referenced historical data, noting that since 1950, there have been nine instances where the market rallied by 20% or more, with the market rising in eight of those cases. However, he pointed out that gains in the following year averaged only 3.6%, indicating a need for careful selection. He also acknowledged recent market trends, including a decline in the S&P 500's performance and a potential shift in investor sentiment following events like the Santa Claus Rally. He predicted a path of lower interest rates, expecting 50 basis points of cuts this year instead of the previously anticipated 100 basis points. Mahn suggested that this environment would create favorable conditions for stocks and bonds but urged investors to diversify beyond mega-cap tech stocks into sectors like biotech and aerospace. Earlier on January 3 as well, Mahn noted that after two consecutive years of gains, a third year of strong performance appears unlikely. He remarked that it seems the Grinch got in the way of the Santa Claus rally this year. He also addressed concerns from investors tempted to time the market or sell their holdings. He warned against trying to time the market, describing it as often futile. Instead, he advocated for rebalancing portfolios to align with long-term goals and risk tolerance. He suggested that the economic landscape is changing, with lower interest rates and stagnant economic growth expected moving forward. Mahn advised investors to take profits from sectors that previously led the market and consider reallocating those funds into different areas poised for future growth. He highlighted biotech as a promising sector, noting bipartisan agreement on the need to lower drug prices. This shift could lead large-cap pharmaceutical companies to seek new revenue sources, making smaller biotech firms attractive.

thesis on Elastic NV (NYSE:ESTC) on ValueInvestorsClub by cuyler1903. In this article, we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on ESTC. The company\u2019s shares were trading at $104.96 when this thesis was published, vs. the closing price of $101.40 on Jan 03. CHAIWATPHOTOS/Shutterstock.com ESTC is a search artificial intelligence (AI) company that delivers hosted and managed solutions designed to run in hybrid, public or private clouds, and multi-cloud environments in the United States and internationally. Its primary products include ElasticSearch, Elastic Observability and Elastic Security. ElasticSearch is a search engine powered by AI that provides customized experience for websites and applications. Observability manages application performance data along with logs and other metrics. Security takes care of threat detection and event management. ESTC has around 21,000 customers across the globe. One of its biggest strengths is the involvement of the promoter Shay Shanon, who is also the CTO of the company. Shay was instrumental in developing the ElasticSearch platform and owns stock worth almost $1 billion. His engagement with employees and clients illustrates how passionate he is about the company. The fact that ESTC won the 2024 Microsoft US Partner of the Year Award is proof that the product is competitive and widely accepted. ESTC enjoys an adjusted EBIT margin of 12% even though it has a high operating expense. With $1 billion in cash, the business is expected to invest heavily in R&D and sales/marketing initiatives. A sticky customer base provides a stable source of revenue with the potential to increase market share. ESTC has an EV/Gross Profit valuation of 7.9x based on 2025 consensus. Its comparable Datadog trades at 14x, implying that ESTC is almost at a 45% discount. While the expected growth rate is 16%, it can definitely match that of its client AWS which has been accelerating at ~18%. With an estimated gross profit of $1.4 billion in 2025, the intrinsic value of the company comes out to be $200, almost 100% higher than the current level. There may be a higher valuation attached if a strategic buyer shows interest in ESTC. While we acknowledge the potential of ESTC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ESTC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock .

"Elastic (ESTC) Upgraded to Buy: What Does It Mean for the Stock? Zacks Equity Research Fri, Dec 27, 2024, 8:00 PM 3 min read In This Article: ESTC -0.94% Elastic (ESTC) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices. The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system. Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Elastic is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price. Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock. Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Elastic imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher. Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>. Story Continues Earnings Estimate Revisions for Elastic This software developer is expected to earn $1.69 per share for the fiscal year ending April 2025, which represents a year-over-year change of 42%. Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Elastic. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 11.8%. Bottom Line Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term. You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>> The upgrade of Elastic to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Wedbush Sees Generative AI Driving 2025 Software Boom Muslim Farooque Thu, Jan 2, 2025, 9:52 PM 1 min read In This Article: SNOW +0.57% ORCL -0.86% ESTC -0.94% Analysts at Wedbush, who also highlighted Palantir (PLTR), Salesforce (CRM), MongoDB (MDB), and Elastic (ESTC), have found Oracle (ORCL) and Snowflake ( NYSE:SNOW ) as prominent artificial intelligence software plays for 2025. Driven by the fast adoption of generative artificial intelligence and huge language models, Wedbush analysts led by Daniel Ives noted in a report on Thursday the emergence of the wider AI software industry as a major development. Ives remarked, \"The AI software era is now here,\" referring to a turning point for the computer industry among what he described as a \"4th Industrial Revolution.\"Comparatively to \"the new gold and oil,\" Ives highlighted Nvidia (NVDA) as the driver of artificial intelligence's spread from its processors. Emphasizing the fundamental role cloud providers and hyperscalersincluding Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), and Amazon Web Services (AMZN)played during AI's first expansion phase, he highlighted. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with SNOW. Wedbush gave Snowflake, Elastic, and MongoDB \"Outperform\" ratings; respective price goals were $190, $135, and $360. Snowflake saw decreases for much of 2024 but rebounded in December. Early Thursday trading saw gains for Oracle, Salesforce, Elastic, and Snowflake as excitement for AI-driven prospects improved.

Emerge as Top AI Software Investments for 2025: Wedbush Faizan Farooque Fri, Jan 3, 2025, 8:01 PM 1 min read In This Article: ORCL -0.86% Oracle ( ORCL , Financials ) and Snowflake ( SNOW , Financials ) are positioned as key players in the artificial intelligence software sector for 2025, according to a recent analysis by Wedbush. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with ORCL. Originally driven by chip technology breakthroughs by NVIDIA ( NVDA , Financials ), Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives underlined the continuous $2 trillion tsunami of artificial intelligence expenditure. With generative AI and big language models driving corporate demand, this investment period has now shifted into a more general emphasis on software adoption. These changes will provide the software sector with major chances. Supported by 29% year-over-year product sales increase, Snowflake is leveraging this momentum by adjusting its fiscal year 2025 revenue projection to $3.43 billion. Along with working with big cloud providers like Microsoft ( MSFT , Financials ), Google ( GOOGL , Financials ), and Amazon ( AMZN , Financials ), the company's innovationsSnowflake Cortex and Snowparkshowcase its strategic posture in the AI and data interoperability field. With a late-year drop that Wedbush analysts see as a desirable starting position for investors, Oracle's stock performance in 2024 demonstrated sustained expansion. With a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 31.94x and estimated FY2025 earnings per share of $6.18, the business has a possible 13.6% upward potential. With price goals set at $135 and $360 respectively, Elastic ( ESTC , Financials ) and MongoDB ( MDB , Financials ) both got \"Outperform\" ratings from Wedbush. Rising acceptance of AI-driven business solutions can help these organizations. This article first appeared on GuruFocus .

(ESTC): Morgan Stanley Highlights GenAI and Vector Search as Key Growth Drivers Ghazal Ahmed Thu, Dec 26, 2024, 6:25 PM 4 min read In This Article: ESTC -0.94% We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News You Can't Miss . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) stands against the other AI stocks you can't miss. According to a Department of Energy-backed study, U.S. data center power demand could nearly triple in the next three years. With the industry going through an artificial intelligence transformation, data centers could account for as much as 12% of total US electricity consumption. The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory report revealed that by 2028, data centers' annual energy use could reach between 74 and 132 gigawatts. The report was produced in an attempt to understand how Big Tech's data center demand will impact electrical grids, power bills, and the climate. READ NOW: Top 12 AI Stock News and Ratings Dominating Wall Street and 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm \"This really signals to us where the frontier is in terms of growing energy demand in the U.S\u2026\"What this report is highlighting is what's actually growing the fastest, and the leading edge of demand growth in the U.S. is the very new growth in artificial-intelligence data centers\u201d. A McKinsey analysis reveals how the United States is expected to be the fastest-growing market for data centers, fueled by the continued increase in data, compute, connectivity from digitalization, cloud migration, as well as the scaling of new technologies, particularly AI. A similar study by Bain & Company reveals that the global electricity demand has jumped an estimated 72% from 2019 to 2023 due to the surge in AI. The study further revealed that by 2027, demand could double 2023 levels and is expected to continue rising after 2027. The rate, however, is highly uncertain, depending on factors such as generative AI adoption, regulations, the data center supply chain\u2019s ability to handle growth, and the commercialization of emerging energy technologies. With the need for energy growing rapidly, the power ecosystem is grappling with many challenges at the same time. From reliable power sources, sustainability of power, and upstream infrastructure for power access, to power equipment within data centers, many issues must be addressed before it can have its power needs satisfied. According to a McKinsey study, the time to get new power connections for data center sites in major data center hubs such as Northern Virginia; Santa Clara, California; and Phoenix has been increasing. So much so that locations outside of the United States have placed moratoriums on many new data center builds primarily because they lack the power infrastructure to support them. As such, meeting these needs is highly important to fully realize the potential of artificial intelligence.

Our third quarter fiscal 2025 quiet period begins at the close of business on Friday, January 17th, 2025. We will be participating in Scotiabank's Global Technology Conference on December 10th, and the Needham Growth Conference on January 16th. With that, I'll turn it over to Ash. Ash Kulkarni -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Anthony, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's call. Elastic delivered a strong second quarter supported by solid sales execution and customer commitments. In Q2, we meaningfully exceeded guidance across all revenue and profitability metrics. Revenue grew by 18% year over year. Cloud revenue grew by 25% year over year, and we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 18%. We also increased the number of customers spending over 100K with us to 1,420. At the start of this fiscal year, we made sales segmentation changes to increase the focus on our key enterprise and high-potential mid-market customers. After some unexpected disruption in sales performance in Q1, we are now starting to see the benefits of the changes we made take hold. Our performance in Q2 reaffirms our confidence in our strategy and shows that we are well on our way to returning to the strong pace of sales execution that we have demonstrated in the past. In Q2, we saw strong customer commitments with key wins across all of our solution areas, especially in search powered by generative AI. We also saw continued consolidation onto the Elastic platform for security and observability, with many customers displacing incumbent legacy products and migrating onto our search AI platform. Turning to generative AI. Our momentum in this area continues to build. In Q2, we saw strong demand for our vector database as customers increasingly adopted Elastic for building semantic search and retrieval augmented generation or RAG applications. Our clear product differentiation and our relentless pace of innovation are helping us become a natural choice for customers building GenAI applications. We are seeing adoption and winning deals across many different industries and for use cases that seek to automate a wide variety of business processes. In Q2, we saw continued acceleration in our search business, with significant tailwinds from GenAI. In Q2, new customer commitments with GenAI almost doubled in dollar volume as compared to what we saw in Q1, with three of the deals we signed being greater than $1 million in annual contract value. We now have over 1,550 customers on Elastic Cloud using us for GenAI use cases with over 240 of these among our cohort of customers spending $100,000 or more with us annually. For example, this quarter, a U.S.-based global leader in the automotive industry expanded its relationship with Elastic in a multiyear seven-figure deal by selecting our Elasticsearch AI platform. The company has standardized Elastic's vector database as the backbone for their retrieval augmented generation and chatbot applications. Elastic's vector database powers over 30 chatbot clusters used for both internal employee support and customer-facing interactions to enhance efficiency by providing real-time relevant answers and driving improved productivity for the organization's workforce. Beyond chatbots, the company is leveraging Elastic's hybrid search capabilities, combining keyword and semantic search for broader applications. We also signed an expansion deal with a leading sporting goods retailer in North America to support their omnichannel experience. Using the Elasticsearch AI platform, the retailer will improve search relevance by adopting semantic search and using advanced AI relevance capabilities like learning to rank to improve margins and profitability in-store and online. The company chose Elastic for our deep expertise in retail search transformation and our integrated machine learning and search AI capabilities, all within a single platform, T3. In addition to GenAI, the other secular tailwind that we have been benefiting from is customer consolidation onto our platform for multiple use cases. Our ability to help customers reduce complexity and drive efficiency at a lower total cost of ownership by consolidating onto the Elastic platform for multiple use cases is helping us secure strong customer commitments and become an increasingly strategic part of their IT infrastructure. And we continue to invest in capabilities and incentives that make it possible for customers to migrate easily from incumbent solutions to Elastic. Last quarter, I talked about the Elastic Express Migration program and our search AI-powered automatic import functionality. And I'm pleased to say that we are seeing significant momentum from customers who are leveraging these to migrate off of legacy offerings onto our platform. These incentives and offerings were critical in helping us win over 40 competitive deals in Q2, where we either displaced incumbent solutions or onboarded new workloads through platform consolidation. This quarter, an online marketplace for short- and long-term homestays selected Elastic Security to replace its existing SIEM solution, marking a strategic shift toward a more scalable and AI-driven security approach. This seven-figure expansion deal involves replacing a complex and inefficient solution, unable to keep up as the company's threat landscape and data footprint grows. The Elasticsearch AI platform, including ESQL and our AI Assistant, will help the company streamline its security operations and ensure faster, more accurate threat detection. Cost efficiency at scale, seamless integration, and advanced AI features were significant factors in their choice of Elastic, positioning us as a key partner in their next-generation security infrastructure. In another seven-figure deal, we signed a new agreement with an insurance provider, displacing two competitive solutions for their cybersecurity operations. The company chose Elastic Security, leveraging our AI Assistant and attack discovery to strengthen their threat detection, incident response, and vulnerability management as part of their broader digital transformation efforts. Now turning to product innovations in Q2. We introduced a steady addition of new AI capabilities, including a number of features that significantly improve our performance as a vector database. We continue to innovate to maintain our position as the most downloaded vector database on the market. Elasticsearch now supports bit vectors, SIMD acceleration, and INT4 quantization to improve performance. And now Elastic is the first vector database to offer better binary quantization, now in tech preview. BBQ, as we refer to it, offers a 32x lower memory footprint compared to storing and searching full precision vectors. It also surpasses traditional methods like product quantization, delivering faster vector search at lower costs without compromising accuracy. Initial benchmarks are showing 30x less quantization time. This is a game changer for navigating the usual vector search trade-offs between cost and accuracy and is only available from Elastic. We also announced the general availability of AutoOps, the outcome of our acquisition of Opster, which significantly simplifies Elasticsearch cluster management with performance recommendations, resource utilization, and cost insights, as well as real-time issue detection and resolution paths. By analyzing hundreds of Elasticsearch metrics, configuration, and usage patterns, AutoOps recommends operational and monitoring insights that deliver real savings in administration time and hardware costs. In security, AI continues to transform the SIEM landscape with the SIEM fast evolving to an AI-driven security analytics solution for the modern SOC. We expect this new generation of solutions to not only subsume traditional SIEM functionality but also consolidate extended protections for various parts of the IT infrastructure, which today require separate tools. Cloud detection and response, or CDR, is one such area of extended protection that we recently integrated into our AI-driven security analytics solution, providing threat detection and response and contextual investigation to protect cloud environments, all within a unified set of workflows already familiar to our SIEM users. As part of this capability, our users can benefit from detection rules that combine cloud telemetry with other relevant logs collected by the SIEM and from context gained from correlating other events and entities to perform streamlined yet informed investigations. Since this capability is fully integrated into our SIEM, CDR users can now benefit from all of Elastic's unique differentiators in the areas of query speed, data management, and relevance-focused AI. In the area of observability, Elastic is now 100% OpenTelemetry or OTel-native. As you know, OTel enables observability users to move from proprietary data ingest mechanisms to an open standard format. As of Q2, all OTel-compliant data is now stored in Elastic without data translation, which removes the need for SRE teams to worry about data formats. Our entire Observability suite now works out of the box for OTel-compliant ingested data. In addition, we introduced our OTel-based Kubernetes integration and dashboards, providing users with instant visibility into clusters and application metrics, logs and traces, all without the need for any manual configuration. Elsewhere, we expanded our LLM observability capabilities to include Amazon Bedrock. This adds to our previously announced support for Azure OpenAI. With this, we provide comprehensive visibility into the performance and usage of foundational models from Bedrock, as well as dashboards and detailed insights into model performance, usage patterns and costs. On the go-to-market front, we kicked off our ElasticON events in Q2 and, to date, have held events in San Francisco, Bangalore, Munich, and New York. Our ElasticON events have drawn thousands of attendees, and we are looking forward to hosting six more events across the globe during fiscal Q3 and Q4. ElasticONs give us the unparalleled opportunity to meet with thousands of customers, partners, prospects, and developers to share ideas and showcase Elastic innovations. Partners play a critical role in our success. This quarter, we launched the new Elastic AI ecosystem as part of our vision to transform, simplify, and accelerate how enterprise developers build and deploy generative AI applications, working with leading technology providers, including Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Anthropic, Cohere, Confluent, DataRobot, Dataiku, Galileo, Google, Hugging Face, LangChain, LlamaIndex, Microsoft, Mistral, NVIDIA, OpenAI, ProtectAI, Red Hat, Unstructured and Vectorize. We have built a comprehensive set of integrations with our Elasticsearch vector database to help developers speed up the time to develop GenAI applications. Now switching to some organizational news. Today, we are announcing that Janesh Moorjani will be leaving Elastic to pursue a new opportunity, and his last day with Elastic will be December 13th. Janesh has been a key part of our leadership team over the past seven years, first as CFO and more recently as CFO and COO. And his tenure here has included a number of major milestones for the company, including leading our IPO back in 2018 and more recently, helping guide the business across the $1 billion mark. Personally, to me, Janesh has been a trusted colleague and a friend over the years, and I want to thank him personally for all that he has done during his time here. I'm looking forward to seeing all that he can accomplish in the years ahead. With this change, I'm happy to have Eric Prengel, Elastic's group vice president of finance, taking on the role of interim chief financial officer effective December 14th while the company conducts a search for a permanent replacement. Eric has been with Elastic for the past two years and has already made significant contributions to Elastic with broad responsibility for various FP&A and business partnership functions. Prior to joining Elastic, Eric spent nearly 10 years at JPMorgan in various investment banking leadership roles. And he was involved with Elastic even then, having worked on our IPO. I have worked closely with Eric during his time here and I'm confident in his disciplined leadership and ability to excel in this role. As such, and not surprisingly, Eric will also be considered as a candidate in our search process. In closing, I'm pleased with our strong performance this quarter. I want to thank our team for their focused execution. And I also want to thank our customers, partners, and investors for their continued support and confidence. We are seeing positive signs that we are well on our way to returning to historical levels in terms of our pace of execution, and our Q2 performance is a strong indication of this progress. The innovations we are building into our search AI platform, the momentum we are gaining around generative AI and the traction we are seeing with customers consolidating onto our platform gives us great confidence in our future and in our ability to build a multibillion-dollar business over time. With that, I'll turn it over to Janesh to go through our financial results in more detail. Janesh Jamnadas Moorjani -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer Thank you, Ash, for those kind words. It's been a privilege to have been part of Elastic's growth journey for the past seven years. I am proud of our successful track record, and I firmly believe that the future for Elastic has never been brighter. It's been an incredible partnership with you personally, and I am deeply grateful for your trust and friendship. While I'm sad to leave behind such a talented team, many of whom are now good friends, I am excited about my next opportunity. I'm confident that the business will be in great hands with Eric. He has been my right hand for almost two years and has proven himself to be an exceptional and disciplined leader. I'll let him say a few words before I get into our results. Eric Prengel -- Group Vice President, Finance Thanks, Ash and Janesh. I really appreciate it. In the almost two years I've been at Elastic, it has been a pleasure to partner with both of you. From my time working on the IPO, I was impressed with the differentiated technology and strong culture that Elastic has. Since joining, it has become even clearer to me that we have an opportunity to be a truly generational company. Janesh, you have shaped so much of Elastic, and I very much appreciate that I got the opportunity to work closely with you. I wish you the absolute best in your next role, and I'm excited to be stepping into this role with all that is in front of Elastic. Janesh Jamnadas Moorjani -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer Thanks, Eric. I'm sure you'll knock it out of the park. Let's get into our Q2 results. With a challenging first quarter behind us, we were pleased that we improved our sales execution in the second quarter with strong customer commitments, as Ash described, and also outperformed against the high end of both our revenue and profitability guidance. Total revenue in the second quarter was $365 million, up 18% year over year as reported and up 17% year over year in constant currency. Subscription revenue in the second quarter totaled $341 million, up 18% year over year as reported and in constant currency. Within subscriptions, revenue from Elastic Cloud was $169 million, growing 25% year over year as reported and in constant currency. Elastic Cloud represented 46% of total revenue in the quarter. Aggregate consumption trends in the second quarter remained healthy with enterprise and commercial customers generally continuing to consume as anticipated against their commitments and with stronger-than-expected consumption among some of our larger customers. Revenue from our Elastic Cloud month-to-month motion, which is driven mainly by self-service SMB customers, was consistent with our expectations and remained flattish in dollar terms, coming in at 13% of total revenue. Consumption revenue can fluctuate across quarters and we've seen such fluctuations in the past so we will continue to monitor this closely. Professional services revenue was $25 million, growing 7% year over year as reported and in constant currency. As a reminder, professional services revenue may fluctuate across quarters based on the timing of service delivery. To add more context around deal flow during the quarter, we had solid sales execution with improving performance compared to the prior quarter. We are pleased with the progress we have made so far and intend to continue our focus and diligence around sales execution. We saw healthy growth across our solutions where search grew the fastest year over year, given the strong traction we've seen in GenAI that Ash described. The quarter's strength was also balanced across geographies where the Americas grew the fastest, followed by EMEA and APJ. Customers continue to make strong multiyear commitments to us, reflecting their preference for Elastic as they consider platform consolidation and reflecting our increasing relevance to their business. We did not see any significant changes in the competitive environment during the quarter. Turning to customer metrics. We ended the second quarter with over 1,420 customers with annual contract values more than $100,000. We continue to be focused on customers with a higher propensity for growth and target such customers in the enterprise and commercial segments. These larger customers provide a strong foundation for our land and expand motion as we continue to scale. Looking at customer additions more broadly, we ended the quarter with over 4,480 customers above $10,000 in ACV and approximately 21,300 total subscription customers. Our net expansion rate was approximately 112%, which was in line with our expectations. Our customer retention rates during the quarter also remained strong. Now turning to profitability and cash flow for which I'll discuss non-GAAP measures. Gross margin in the quarter was 76.9%, consistent with the past several quarters. Our operating margin in the quarter was 17.6%, which was significantly better than expected, driven primarily by our strong revenue outperformance and continued discipline in spending, with some of our expense efficiency actions that we had previously discussed coming in larger than expected and also taking hold earlier in the quarter than we had anticipated. Diluted earnings per share in the second quarter was $0.59. Adjusted free cash flow was approximately $38 million in the second quarter, which translated to 10% adjusted free cash flow margin. Cash flow on a quarterly basis fluctuates, given timing issues and seasonality so we continue to look at this primarily on a full year basis. Although we don't formally guide to cash flow, we continue to expect adjusted free cash flow margin for fiscal '25 to be slightly above the non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal '25. As you know, our adjusted free cash flow is on an unlevered basis. Turning to guidance. Looking ahead, our market opportunity remains large. The Elasticsearch AI platform is highly differentiated, our GenAI traction is strong and customers are continuing to consolidate workloads onto our platform. Given the revenue outperformance in the second quarter and our conviction around our opportunity ahead, we are raising our full year total revenue outlook. As we look into the second half of fiscal '25, we assume that the current business environment will remain similar to the first half of the year. We remain focused on execution and believe that we are well-positioned for long-term growth and profitability. In the third quarter, we expect both self-managed and annual cloud revenue to grow slightly in dollar terms compared to the second quarter. I'll highlight some of the factors we considered in our guidance. First, while our most recent performance gives us confidence in our improving sales execution, the shortfall on customer commitments we experienced in the first quarter of this year will remain a headwind to year-over-year revenue growth in the back half of this year. Second, we have considered that consumption revenue on both annual contracts and in the month-to-month motion can fluctuate. Since we've seen such fluctuations before, we have been prudent in our assumptions on consumption rates on annual contracts for the remainder of the year. We also continue to expect revenue from our month-to-month motion on Elastic Cloud will remain somewhat flat for the rest of this year. Third, we have considered the revenue headwind from the recent strength in the U.S. dollar. Finally, in terms of seasonal effects in the third quarter, professional services revenue is typically impacted by the holiday season. With respect to GenAI, as Ash described in his remarks, customer interest around generative AI use cases remains very strong. The strength of our technology and our pace of innovation underpins our position as a market leader in this space. We are still in the very early stages of capturing the substantial and rapidly growing market opportunity, and we continue to believe this will be a significant growth driver for us over the long term. As we consider investments in the business, we plan to continue to balance investing for revenue growth with profitability. Given the improvements we saw in our sales execution in the second quarter, we are selectively increasing some investments in the second half of the year. We will continue to prioritize investments toward areas intended to drive growth, particularly in GenAI. With the operating leverage inherent in our business model, we are also raising our profitability guidance for the year. We remain well-positioned to drive higher operating margins as we scale the business in future years. With that background, for the third quarter of fiscal '25, we expect total revenue in the range of $367 million to $369 million. This represents 12% year-over-year growth at the midpoint on an as-reported basis and 13% year-over-year growth at the midpoint in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter of fiscal '25 to be approximately 15% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.46 to $0.48 using between 106 million and 107 million diluted weighted average ordinary shares outstanding. For full fiscal '25, we expect total revenue in the range of $1.451 billion to $1.457 billion. This represents 15% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, both on an as-reported basis and in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP operating margin for full fiscal '25 to be approximately 13.5% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.68 to $1.72 using between 106 million and 108 million diluted weighted average ordinary shares outstanding. In summary, we are pleased with our performance in the second quarter and remain confident in our ability to continue to drive profitable growth going forward. And with that, let's go ahead and take questions. Operator? Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] The first question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Matthew Hedberg -- Analyst Great, thanks for taking my questions, guys. Congrats on the results. Really a nice bounce-back quarter. There's a lot of things that stood out to me. I think the success in cross-selling, but also Janesh, you said something about larger enterprise, particularly their consumption patterns accelerated. I'm wondering if you could double-click on that. Was there any commonality there that drove that trend? Janesh Jamnadas Moorjani -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer Matt, so just digging into that consumption number, overall consumption was quite strong across Q2. We are very pleased with the results that we saw. And that was across enterprise and commercial. It was across the different geos as well, across the solution areas. We did see some strength among some of our larger customers that accelerated their consumption. And that was really encouraging because they're continuing to use the Elasticsearch AI platform for both new and expanded workloads. In terms of whether there was any particular commonality there or similarity to the past, we have seen consumption be stronger in prior periods as well, but it's not necessarily the same customers that are always stronger so there can be some variations there. So, I wouldn't read too much into that. We were obviously pleased with the results but we will continue to monitor it carefully to see if there's any particular patterns or trends that emerge. From our standpoint, as we built our guidance for Q3, although we are very pleased with the consumption rates that we saw in the second quarter, we have seen these rates fluctuate in the past. So, we built our guidance quite prudently. And just for clarity, we've not actually seen any change in the business so far. We are simply considering the possibility that consumption patterns may revert to what we previously experienced prior to Q2. So, that's the way we approached it. Matthew Hedberg -- Analyst Well, that's great. Well, it seems like there's others that are also talking about better consumption trends from last night. Maybe just, Ash, for you, it was great to see the sales force bounce back here. I'm wondering, is there anything that you'd put your finger on that drove to that better sales execution? I know there was a lot of changes in 1Q. But curious if you can understand sort of what the positive change factor was this quarter. And I know Janesh is being conservative in back half guidance, but the opportunity for continued improvement there, just sort of curious on your thoughts there. Ash Kulkarni -- Chief Executive Officer Yes, Matt. Thanks for the question. So, even in the last earnings call, in the Q1 earnings call, like I had mentioned, we felt pretty confident that the changes that we had made at the beginning of the year were the right changes. And what we've seen is with rigor, as we've been inspecting the pipeline and making sure that we are doing all the right things with discipline, a few things have already happened or are happening at the pace that we want them to. First, we have seen that the pace of pipeline creation and pipeline progression has come back to normal levels, so we are really happy about that. The second thing that we have seen is just the changes, the reason why we made the changes to begin with were all about focusing more on the enterprise segment, on the high-propensity, mid-market segments, and the benefits of those are now starting to take hold. And just as our reps have had more time to work on their accounts, to work with their accounts, we have started to see all the right kinds of behaviors that we were expecting to see, and that's what gives me a lot of confidence going forward. And as we've said, the thing that happened in Q1 was a near-term impact, and I'm really happy that the team really delivered in Q2 and we are moving in the right direction. Matthew Hedberg -- Analyst Great. And Janesh, it's been great working with you. Best of luck in your future endeavors. Janesh Jamnadas Moorjani -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer Thank you, Matt. Operator The next question comes from Pinjalim Bora with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Pinjalim Bora -- Analyst Great. Congrats on the quarter. Janesh, from me as well, great working with you, and all the best. And Eric, congrats on the interim role. I want to ask you, Ash, on binary quantization. Seems like it's a differentiation for Elastic from a vector D perspective. But my understanding is quantization is kind of a trade-off between accuracy and cost. Help me understand how pervasive is that going to be across kind of different GenAI use cases. Ash Kulkarni -- Chief Executive Officer It is something that I am personally very excited about. Our team is very excited about it. Like you correctly pointed out, quantization is always a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency or performance. And better binary quantization, we are the first to really deliver this capability. And what it does is it delivers an absolutely amazing level of efficiency, everything from how much memory is required to the time it takes to do the actual quantization to even query performance, and all of those with very little impact on accuracy. And that's what's so great about this algorithm. Like I mentioned in my prepared remarks, this, we feel, is a true game changer. And at this phase, we are still in the very early phases of the whole AI revolution, the way I see it, the way we see it. This is the time when we want to make sure that we are delivering the kinds of asymmetric innovations that will allow us to really gain maximum share in this market. And so, I'm personally very excited. The applicability is pretty broad and we are just going to drive this hard. Pinjalim Bora -- Analyst Yes, understood. Janesh, one question for you. It seems like a very strong cloud consumption quarter. But when I look at the RPO numbers, especially on the sequential trend, it seems a little bit muted, given that a number of deals pushed out of last quarter. You had noted you had closed a lot of those. So, maybe how would you characterize kind of the bookings cadence at this point versus historical norms, given the changes that you see? It's improving but we are not there yet. Janesh Jamnadas Moorjani -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer Pinjalim, we were actually very pleased with our overall sales execution in Q2. Really happy to see that the team bounced back and the additional measures that we had taken following Q1, they are having the desired effect, and sales reps have also had more time to engage with their new accounts. So, I think all of that played quite nicely for us. While there were many deals that moved out of Q1 that we closed in Q2, those were not the main driver of strength for us in the second quarter. But overall, looking ahead, I think we feel pretty good about the outlook for the rest of the year. With respect to the RPO timing and the quarter-over-quarter changes in RPO, that was consistent with what we've delivered before and, in fact, probably even slightly higher than the sequential change that you may have seen in the year-ago quarter. So, we felt pretty good about that as well. Pinjalim Bora -- Analyst Got it. Thank you. Operator The next question comes from Tyler Radke with Citi. Please go ahead. Tyler Radke -- Citi -- Analyst Janesh, it's been great working with you, and all the best. Good to see you leave on a high note here. Ash, I wanted to go back to some of the GenAI use cases. Sounded like a very strong quarter in terms of commitments, the doubling quarter over quarter. But I'm curious how you're kind of seeing those types of use cases unfold. It sounded like you referenced some use cases where you're kind of the backbone in terms of being the vector database supporting 40 different use cases with agents and chatbots and then some other use cases just around semantic search. So, maybe help us understand, are you kind of orienting the sales force around kind of discrete go-to-market motions, particularly around GenAI to serve those use cases? Just give us a flavor of kind of how you're standardizing the GenAI go-to-market and use case evaluation here. Ash Kulkarni -- Chief Executive Officer Yes, that's a great question, Tyler. So, the first thing I'd say is as we look at the market broadly, across pretty much every industry and every vertical, what we see is that there are a lot of processes, business processes that depend upon unstructured data being manually processed and moved from one step of the process to the next step. And all of those have the ability to be automated through generative AI. So, we are looking at that. And effectively, our strategy is to be that runtime platform for retrieval augmented generation, for anybody building those kinds of generative AI applications. Now some of those will begin, first and foremost, by somebody just implementing better search through semantic search, techniques like hybrid search to get the most relevant precise data for their use cases and their applications. And then they'll evolve from there to building the kinds of chatbots and generative applications that then automate that process. And we just want to be the underlying layer, the underlying platform for all of those things. And so instead of taking a vertical-by-vertical approach, we're basically taking a platform approach. And as you know, that's been really something that has worked very, very well for us in the past. And our motion around this is very simple. Our field just goes in and talks about semantic search. And the simple question is, how are you thinking about vector databases? What vector database are you using? And it just leads from there naturally to either a semantic search sale or a hybrid search sale or a retrieval augmented generation search kind of opportunity. And we are starting to see, like in the past, I've said that a lot of these tend to be internally focused applications. But now you're starting to see a blend of both internal-focused and external as people are getting more and more comfortable. I think that's exciting. Tyler Radke -- Citi -- Analyst Yes, thanks. Ashton. Janesh, for you, just going back to the commentary around the large customers consumption in the quarter. I guess as you think about the stronger-than-expected trends that you saw, would you say that that was kind of one-time in nature? Or was this kind of onboarding new use cases? And just to clarify, you're saying that you're seeing these strong trends continue, you're just not embedding it into the guidance? Just wanted to clarify that. Thank you. Janesh Jamnadas Moorjani -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer Tyler, yes, so in terms of what we saw, absolutely, we saw the strength be broad-based. I wouldn't characterize it as one-time. It was just some of our larger accounts consumed at a faster pace and that was really encouraging to see. I think that's reflective of all of the things that we've been doing and driving over the past several quarters that ultimately get reflected in customer commitments that then translate into consumption. We've talked about the momentum that we've seen in GenAI. We've talked about the platform consolidation. So, I think that there's a lot of goodness in terms of what the teams have been driving, which has translated into higher consumption rates. So, it was higher than what we expected but I wouldn't characterize it as onetime. In terms of what that means for the future and the assumptions that we're using for the future, you're right. We have not seen any change in the business. We have not seen anything adverse, but we're just being prudent in terms of how we build our forecast because we have seen historically, consumption rates can fluctuate, and we think we just want to be careful with that and not get ahead of our ski tips. Tyler Radke -- Citi -- Analyst Yes. I guess you're guiding before Thanksgiving for the first time so a lot more days in the quarter. Janesh Jamnadas Moorjani -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer That's right. That's exactly right. Great. Tyler Radke -- Citi -- Analyst All right. Thanks, Janesh. All the best. Janesh Jamnadas Moorjani -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer Thank you, Tyler. Operator The next question comes from Koji Ikeda with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Koji Ikeda -- Analyst Yes, hey, guys, thanks. Thanks for taking the questions. Hey, Ash, and Janesh, thanks for everything. All the best to you. And Eric, looking forward to working with you. So, I have a question on the sales organization, and I guess the question is on a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate where you are today with the sales org? 10 being back in business and fully ramped on the new strategy. Where are you at today? And if it's less than 10, what needs to happen to get it to 10? The reason why I ask is the fiscal second quarter results are really strong. But I keep staring at that implied fiscal fourth quarter exit growth rate of 11%. So, I'm just wondering if we could still see effects of the sales org change playing out over the coming quarters. Or is there just massive conservatism embedded in the guide? Ash Kulkarni -- Chief Executive Officer Koji, thank you very much for the question. So, I'm not a huge fan of putting anything on a scale, but here's what I'll say. First of all, I'm really happy not only at the way we performed but the metrics that I look at internally are effectively, are we creating pipe at the right pace? And are we progressing pipe at the right pace? And in both of those areas, I've seen that our pace of pipeline creation and our pace of pipeline progression has come back to normal. Also, our win rates continue to be incredibly strong, and those are the fundamentals, right, when you think about your sales strategy. All of those things are working as they should. And the Q2 results from that perspective give me a lot of confidence about where we are. Now in terms of the guidance so on, why don't I ask Eric and Janesh to maybe weigh in? Eric Prengel -- Group Vice President, Finance Yes, sure. I'll take this. Thanks, Koji. What I'd say is, as Ash has said and as Janesh said on the call, we're very pleased with our revenue outperformance in our second quarter, which was driven by both stronger commitments and strong levels of consumption. And as you think about our guidance for the rest of the year, in terms of the year-over-year revenue growth, you need to keep in mind that the effects of the shortfall on customer commitments in the first quarter are going to have an ongoing impact on the year-on-year growth of the business. For self-managed, that's already playing through in the second quarter and so it will be similar. But for cloud, there's going to be an increased headwind in the second half, given it usually takes several months to fully ramp cloud consumption. This dynamic is something we anticipated and we've considered and it is in our outlook as we've shared it. So, that's the way I'd think about it. There's also a slight headwind year over year on year-over-year growth in the back half from currency effects. Most importantly, I think that our focus is to maintain our sales execution the way it was in Q2 so we can continue the positive momentum that we saw and continue to secure customer commitments. Koji Ikeda -- Analyst Got it. Janesh Jamnadas Moorjani -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer Thanks. Yes. Koji, I'll just add that, obviously, it's too early to talk about '26 specifically. But as you think about that exit growth rate, our revenue next year will largely be determined by sales activity from here on out in Q3 and Q4. And we feel pretty good about where we are on that trajectory as Ash said. Koji Ikeda -- Analyst OK. And just one follow-up here. Ash, in your prepared remarks, you talked about three deals, generative AI deals being $1 million in annual contract value. Super impressive there. The question here is, are these for specific generative AI projects? And what I'm trying to understand is that we've been waiting for these big commitments to come. And so, if these are for specific generative AI contracts, does that really imply that as experiences, generative AI experiences come to fruition, I mean, Elastic could be a beneficiary of lots of these big, big six-, seven-figure deals for very specific generative AI projects? Thank you. Ash Kulkarni -- Chief Executive Officer Yes, that's a great question. And what I'd say is, first of all, generative AI is sort of the fastest-growing part of our business at this point, like we are seeing a lot of traction in it. Keep in mind, Koji, that we don't have a discrete generative AI SKU, as you know. And because of that reason, the metrics that we look at and the metrics that we are sharing with you are sort of the directional metrics that we've shared, right? The fact that we are now seeing commitments really grow very nicely because, as you know, it starts with the design wins. We've talked about those design wins in the past, and we are now even in cloud, we have over 1,550 customers. Then it moves from there to customers actually making meaningful commitments and now we're giving you some color on that. And then that translates into revenue. So, this is exciting. This is why I feel really good about the long-term trajectory for the business. And that's the reason why like our focus now is to continue to execute like we did on the sales front in Q2, so we can keep building that up and keep progressing. Koji Ikeda -- Analyst Thanks, Ash. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Ash Kulkarni -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator The next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brent Thill -- Analyst Thanks, Ash. I'm On the go-to-market, I guess I'm confused. You say that you're pleased with your sales team, yet your RPO is flat Q1 to Q2. Your competitors are growing RPO twice the speed of you. And so, I'm just trying to reconcile this. Is it you're pleased with a pipeline that's building back because it hasn't converted in the backlog yet? So, I just want to make sure we clarify what you mean by that. Janesh Jamnadas Moorjani -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer Brent, maybe I'll jump in, and then Ash can add. In terms of the math behind the RPO, if you look at the RPO in year-over-year terms, it's roughly flat. But in year-over-year terms, keep in mind that RPO is a point-in-time cumulative measure of all prior activity. So, the Q1 shortfall from commitments does impact the Q2 year-over-year growth rate in RPO. But if you think about more current activity from Q2 and you consider the sequential growth, it is up a little bit. And usually in Q2, sequentially, RPO has gone down. So, if you look at last year, for example, RPO was a little bit lower in Q2 than in Q1. So, we were actually quite pleased, and again, we're not declaring mission accomplished on the sales execution side. We've said that we are pleased with the progress that we've made in terms of our return to that. And you see that reflected in these numbers, and you see that reflected in all of the other indicators of the business as well, RPO being just one of the several indicators of the business that we all look at collectively. Brent Thill -- Analyst OK. And when you think about search as a percent of total revenue versus broader observability, is it still roughly a 30-70 split or is that changed? Ash Kulkarni -- Chief Executive Officer Yes, let me maybe touch upon that, and I'll ask Janesh and Eric to also weigh in. But look, the overall mix of the business changes from quarter to quarter, but at an annualized level, it takes a while for mix shifts to happen. Search has definitely been accelerating for us and I've talked about that in Q1. It was the same in Q2. This quarter, all parts of our business grew. When I look at the actual customer commitments that we got and the way we are seeing our business grow, I feel good that in all three solution areas, we are taking share, but search is definitely benefiting more, given the trends that we are seeing in generative AI. Brent Thill -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator The next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Can I stay on search and maybe one more question? Ash, if you think about the offering there, and you have a very large installed base in search because that's kind of where you guys started out, how do you think about the opportunity there in terms of going back to all of them or to a lot of them and just kind of saying, OK, like, look, we have hybrid search now. You can get better outcomes as kind of a starting point for doing more stuff around GenAI than anyway. But like where are we on that journey of the whole client base understanding what you can offer now and kind of working on that one? Because it does feel like it's still very early. Ash Kulkarni -- Chief Executive Officer Yes, Raimo. What I'd say is that that is the natural motion for us. And as you can imagine, for our customer base, the data is already in Elasticsearch. So, for us to go to them and make that case that now they can get even better, more relevant results is a pretty straightforward thing. So, for sales teams, when you see a motion, when you see a sales motion that is natural, that your customers relate to, where you already have a good setup because the data is in Elasticsearch already, like that's just a natural place for them to go. And we are seeing that happen. We're seeing our sales teams do that naturally. A big part of the success that we are seeing in generative AI is because of that. So, where are we in that overall journey? We've got a large customer base, as you know. And if you see the progress that we have made, we now have 240 customers in Elastic Cloud that are part of that greater than $100,000 cohort. And we've gotten there this quickly because that is the motion that our sales team is driving. So, lots more to go but very excited and happy about the progress. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Yes, perfect. And then one follow-up for me was you mentioned, Ash, you talked earlier about the SIEM opportunity. Obviously, there has been a lot of disruption in the market with some of the takeout, et cetera. What are you seeing there in terms of customer engagement with you guys around SIEM? And Janesh, it was an honor working with you. Ash Kulkarni -- Chief Executive Officer Yes, thank you for that question. Even on SIEM, like even in my prepared remarks, I talked about a couple of consolidation deals that we won. They were both security-related. In SIEM, to your point, like what we're really seeing happening is AI is now becoming not just a nice-to-have but almost a must-have when people think about security analytics and SIEM. And people are looking at ways in which AI can be used to fundamentally improve the entire detection and remediation process. And given the early foray that we made into this, like we were ahead of most in terms of leaning in with AI, just given our core strengths in vector database and so on, we've seen a tremendous opportunity and we are seeing that momentum build. So, I'm quite excited about it. Things like the Express Migration program that we launched are also helping because some of these are greenfield opportunities, but many of them are ones where there is a displacement opportunity. So, I would expect that you should expect us to continue pushing hard in this area in security and also leaning into the whole AI space to allow us to win. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst OK, perfect. Thank you. Operator The next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Ittai Kidron -- Analyst Janesh, my thanks to you as well, and good luck on the next move. Ash, I wanted to ask again about the search AI. I'm sorry, getting back to these 1,550 customers, that's quite impressive and quite nice. But can you tell us how many of these customers were historical search customers, I mean, you just added the AI capabilities, or were net new to the company? And perhaps what's the penetration right now of AI within your search base? Ash Kulkarni -- Chief Executive Officer Several of these are new customers. And as you can imagine, a large number of them are existing customers. At the end of the day, when you think about the sales-led motion for our sales team, the expand motion is the most natural thing for them to do. It's the most efficient way for them to go in and meet their numbers. So, in that sense, like we are naturally seeing that happen. But then because of our self-service motion, we see new customers come to our platform. And this is an important reason why customers have the opportunity to come to our platform, just the vector search capabilities. So, it's a mix, that's the best way to describe it. And in terms of the opportunity for us to go across our entire customer base and get them to start using this capability, especially the search part of our installed base, there's still a lot of room for continued expansion and growth. Ittai Kidron -- Analyst Very good. And then maybe on the competitive front, can you elaborate a little bit more? What do you view is your toughest competition here on the GenAI side and on the SIEM? Like who are the one or two vendors that you see most frequently? And when you talk about the displacements, I think you talked about it more in the context of SIEM on the call. Where are the greatest displacement opportunities that you see right now? Ash Kulkarni -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. Look, when it comes to displacement opportunities, there's a whole host of incumbent vendors. Like the way I like to think about it is sort of the early generation of SIEM players, everybody from Splunk to a QRadar to ArcSight, I mean, there's a pretty large set of players that have been in this space. And for us, the way we describe ourselves, we are a modern next-generation SIEM. We think of ourselves as a security analytics product. The way our customers are able to do adhoc AI-based analysis on our platform is something that's incredibly differentiated. And because of the flexibility of our back end, we are able to bring in data from just about everybody. And that's a big part of why we are succeeding in this area. When it comes to GenAI, look, we don't have our own large language models, right? So, we partner with just about everybody. You saw the announcement that we made about the AI ecosystem. So, we are partnering with a lot of players that provide their own large language models. Our core place, the way we want to position ourselves is as the platform for retrieval augmented generation. We want to be the vector database of choice and then also provide some of the capabilities around it. So, we aren't the only vector database in town. There are pure plays out there that you might have heard of. And then in my opinion, every data platform is likely going to have their own vector functionality. And our core strength is when it comes to unstructured messy data, right, whether it's logs, whether it's Word documents, whether it's product descriptions, that data is always is best suited to bring into Elasticsearch. And we have the best vector database to support those kinds of use cases. And that's a massive amount of data that exists in every company. So, I feel that as long as we focus on what we are doing in that area and continue to innovate the way we have been, the market opportunity is huge. Ittai Kidron -- Analyst Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator The next question comes from Howard Ma with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Howard Ma -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst Great, thank you. My question is for Janesh and/or Eric. So, it sounds like you did not make up for the Q1 shortfall in customer commits in Q2 despite the bounce back. But when you factor in the acceleration in consumption trends, it sounds like maybe you were back on track with your revenue targets before the cut last quarter, and that you're just being a bit conservative with your back-half assumptions. Is that true? Or maybe just ask another way, had you known you would achieve the Q2 performance that you did, both commits and consumption, would you still have lowered your full year guide last quarter? Eric Prengel -- Group Vice President, Finance Thanks, Howard. And I think what I'd say to that is that given the headwinds that we saw in Q1, it's going to impact the full year and I think we still would have lowered our guidance. Q2 was obviously strong and we're very happy with the outcome in Q2. But what happened in Q1 is unfortunately going to play out over the rest of the year. And particularly, as we said before, cloud is going to have a little more of a headwind in the back half specifically versus what it had in Q2, given the timing of the customer commitments. So, while we are very happy with the performance in Q2, we would have still made the same decision that we did. Howard Ma -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst OK. Thanks for clarifying that, Eric. I just had a follow-up for Ash. When you look over the last 12 months, how would you describe the pace of adoption of vector database, ELSER, hybrid search for GenAI use cases? And compare that to how you expect the pace of adoption will play out over the next 12 months. And on a related note, could you, in the next few quarters, next quarter or the quarter after, we start seeing a disclosure of AI contribution to total revenue, maybe when it hits 2%, 3%, 5%? Like is that perhaps in the works? Thank you. Ash Kulkarni -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, let me touch upon the first, and then I might invite Janesh and Eric to also talk about the second piece. So, in terms of the adoption, the phases of adoption that I'm seeing are not that different from the phases of adoption of other technologies in prior generations, like cloud computing and so on. It all starts with people sort of trying to build prototypes first. There's a lot of design work that goes in. You want to be baked into those designs. People are still trying to figure out how many of those go into full-scale production versus not. We saw a lot of that about 18 months ago and so on. Since then, we've started to see people actually take many of these into production. First, it was internal-facing applications. Now it's also external-facing applications. This is very similar to the pattern that we would have expected. What I'd say is it's happening in a much more compressed time frame. So, the time it's taken from this being sort of early to now people building these applications and deploying them, it's happened much faster than anybody would have expected. So, that's been the exciting part. Now what we see is customers actually being very, very thoughtful about things like efficiency, things like performance, things like scale because they really want to not only put it in production but put it in very large-scale production. And so, the kinds of innovations that we are working on are all related to those kinds of things, right? We're past the basics and now it's into the more sophisticated stuff, which you see from us even in terms of the capabilities that we are delivering like better binary quantization and so on. In terms of the metrics, your second question, I'll just say one thing that keep in mind that we don't have a separate SKU, right? But with that, like, Eric, any thoughts, Eric or Janesh? Eric Prengel -- Group Vice President, Finance Yes. To Ash's point, we don't have a separate SKU. And what we have done is we've always tried to give appropriate indicators and color around the traction that we're seeing in generative AI. We shared that we have 1,550 of our cloud customers who are using generative AI and that of those 1,550, 240 of them are 100K-plus customers. Ash already also shared some of the traction that we saw this quarter with the generative AI commitments more than almost doubling relative to what we saw in Q1. So, it is something that will be evolving what we share but it is not something that we have a specific SKU on to that point. Howard Ma -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst OK, great. Thanks. And great to see the bounce back. Ash Kulkarni -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator The next question comes from Austin Dietz with UBS. Please go ahead. Austin Dietz -- UBS -- Analyst Great. Thanks guys. Maybe just another question on RPO. Janesh, it sounded like you felt good about the trajectory of the business in Q3 and Q4. Could you maybe talk about the second half what you're seeing? And is it possible, especially as we have more time for that sales execution motion to continue to improve, could RPO see an uptick kind of on a sequential dollar growth basis in the second half, especially relative to last year? Thanks. Janesh Jamnadas Moorjani -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer Austin, yes, happy to talk about that. So, look, as we continue to execute in the back half of the year, especially if we execute well, you will see that reflected in all of the metrics that we talk about. And as I was talking about the guidance and the specific assumptions, I've used for building the guidance, I laid them all out earlier so I won't repeat them necessarily here. But fundamentally, you're right. If we execute well, you will see that reflected not only in RPO but in all the other metrics, including in revenue. Austin Dietz -- UBS -- Analyst OK, great. And then just last, Ash. As a part of those go-to-market changes, it seemed like there was more of a focus on greenfield opportunities, new logos. Can you update us on how that's progressing? Thanks. Ash Kulkarni -- Chief Executive Officer Yes, thanks for the question. So, like you said, there one of the things that we did was we took a lot of the accounts that weren't really being worked, and we turned them into distinct greenfield territories and assigned sellers to go pursue those. As you know, typically, it takes a lot longer to build pipeline in greenfield territories and to convert those opportunities. So, what I'd say is that we are still in the early days. But when I look at the overall pipeline creation and progression, I feel very good about the pace coming back to what we've seen historically. And the area of greenfield territories, we're going to just keep tracking it and make sure that we continue to build the momentum in those areas. Austin Dietz -- UBS -- Analyst OK, great. Thanks, guys. Operator The next question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Kash Rangan -- Analyst Janesh, good luck with the next gig here. One for you, Ash, maybe two things. One is when you talk about the GenAI progress, what are the metrics that you are tracking? So, granted that you do not have a revenue to disclose to us, you talk about use cases, but how would you define GenAI success in a way that we can say, OK, that makes sense relative to say a Microsoft or a ServiceNow that seem to be talking about GenAI bookings or AI bookings? And also, another question for you. When you look at the go-to-market motion, you sell a platform so you do not really know the use cases instance-by-instance. How does that percolate into having the right go-to-market strategy granted that GenAI is emerging as a use case? Do we not know what the sales force is hunting for and they come back and tell you, and then sometime later, when the implementation happens you find out that it's implemented for search versus observability versus SIEM versus AI, whatnot? So, trying to understand how, if we do not know what the sale is for, how do you articulate and fine-tune the go-to-market strategy? Thank you so much. Ash Kulkarni -- Chief Executive Officer That's a great question. I'm glad that you asked it, Kash. So, let me clarify. Yes, so first and foremost, the internal -- let me address your first question. When we look at generative AI, the metrics that we look at, first and foremost, we see how many customers are using us specifically for generative AI in the cloud because there we have perfect telemetry and we know exactly how they're using us because we can see that they have created indexes specifically for dense vectors and so on. The second thing that we look at is the customer commitments that are being made that are related to generative AI use cases. Now there, it is all based on the information that we get from our sales teams at the time of the deal closure, right? So, we know that a particular deal is related to semantic search or it's related to somebody in that company that I talked about building a chatbot or several chatbots. So, at the time of the sale, we know what that customer commitment is related to. Now that is customer commitments. But when you think about revenue, once the customer has purchased something from us and they are running, they have stood up a cluster of Elasticsearch, and they are now, let's say, doing semantic search or RAG on that cluster, at some point of time, they might decide that they also want to do some observability workload on that same cluster. If they do that, we would not know exactly how to parse out what percentage of that compute, of that actual consumption, is related to the GenAI piece versus the observability piece. So, all the data that we have, when it comes to things other than cloud, effectively are at sale time. And even on cloud, if it's in the same cluster because we don't have a separate SKU, it's hard to disambiguate. So, what we look at is customer commitments. And that's true even for our other solution areas. So, that's why when we talk about the solution mix, we always say that it's based on reported information from our sales teams. And there, we absolutely do have that clarity. That also guides our go-to-market motion. So, based on that information, we know exactly what is working, where we are seeing success, and that's how we guide our sales teams to make sure that we are maximizing the opportunity ahead of us. Kash Rangan -- Analyst Got it. And we can save this for another discussion maybe at your Analyst Day or whatever, but I'm curious in the long term, how does the go-to-market strategy evolve and the product marketing and the product management evolve? So, you can actually go to market with a case bundle. You don't have to address this now, but I'm just throwing it out there. But the real question I wanted to follow up with was, at what point do you feel like you need to add or accelerate the sales capacity growth rate? Because clearly, if things work out the way you would like to, the growth of the company can be better. For that to happen, you need to also have another round of investing in sales capacity, go-to-market. I'm just curious how you look at the trade-off of faster revenue growth rate versus enjoying the margin structure that you do currently. Thank you so much and that's it for me. Ash Kulkarni -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. Thanks, Kash. So, we see our growth opportunity as continuing. And just to be very clear, even when at the end of Q1, we said that we are going to be taking some near-term cost control actions, all of them were such that we did not affect our selling capacity. We are continuing to make sure that we give ourselves the room to continue to grow in the best way possible. But to talk about some of those investments and so on, let me actually turn it to Janesh. Janesh Jamnadas Moorjani -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer Kash, so as Ash mentioned, we are seeing the course on investments. And in fact, as we look at the second half of this year, just given our revenue outperformance in the second quarter, we are actually increasing our investments in the second half a little bit. And given the strength of the operating leverage inherent in the model, we're able to do both, add to the margin, as well as increase the investments. And those investments will go toward a variety of functions, including selling capacity, which, as you know, is important for us to make sure we enter fiscal '26 with the right amount of productive selling capacity as well. So, we're definitely keeping an eye toward that growth in the future and investing appropriately toward it. Kash Rangan -- Analyst Awesome, very good to hear. Thank you so much. Operator This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ash Kulkarni for any closing remarks. Please go ahead. Ash Kulkarni -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you all for joining us today. We are extremely excited about the continued momentum in our business, driven by generative AI, and we look forward to continuing our strong execution. For those of you who will be at AWS re:Invent, I look forward to seeing you there. Have a great day.

Article: ESTC -0.94% Two Reasons to Avoid ESTC and One Stock to Buy Instead Since June 2024, Elastic has been in a holding pattern, posting a small loss of 4.9% while floating around $103.68. The stock also fell short of the S&P 500\u2019s 6.1% gain during that period. Is now the time to buy Elastic, or should you be careful about including it in your portfolio? See what our analysts have to say in our full research report, it\u2019s free . We're sitting this one out for now. Here are two reasons why we avoid ESTC and a stock we'd rather own. Why Is Elastic Not Exciting? Started by Shay Banon as a search engine for his wife's growing list of recipes at Le Cordon Bleu cooking school in Paris, Elastic (NYSE:ESTC) helps companies integrate search into their products and monitor their cloud infrastructure. 1. Operating Losses Sound the Alarms While many software businesses point investors to their adjusted profits, which exclude stock-based compensation (SBC), we prefer GAAP operating margin because SBC is a legitimate expense used to attract and retain talent. This is one of the best measures of profitability because it shows how much money a company takes home after developing, marketing, and selling its products. Elastic\u2019s expensive cost structure has contributed to an average operating margin of negative 8% over the last year. Unprofitable, high-growth software companies require extra attention because they spend heaps of money to capture market share. As seen in its fast historical revenue growth, this strategy seems to have worked so far, but it\u2019s unclear what would happen if Elastic reeled back its investments. Wall Street seems to be optimistic about its growth, but we have some doubts. Elastic Operating Margin (GAAP) 2. Free Cash Flow Projections Disappoint If you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills. Over the next year, analysts\u2019 consensus estimates show they\u2019re expecting Elastic\u2019s free cash flow margin of 14.6% for the last 12 months to remain the same. Final Judgment Elastic isn\u2019t a terrible business, but it doesn\u2019t pass our quality test. With its shares lagging the market recently, the stock trades at 7\u00d7 forward price-to-sales (or $103.68 per share). Investors with a higher risk tolerance might like the company, but we don\u2019t really see a big opportunity at the moment. We're pretty confident there are superior stocks to buy right now. We\u2019d suggest looking at FTAI Aviation, an aerospace company benefiting from Boeing and Airbus\u2019s struggles . Stocks We Would Buy Instead of Elastic The elections are now behind us. With rates dropping and inflation cooling, many analysts expect a breakout market to cap off the year - and we\u2019re zeroing in on the stocks that could benefit immensely.
