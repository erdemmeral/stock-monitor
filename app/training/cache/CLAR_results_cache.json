Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 5 Growth Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 5 Growth Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Strong Momentum Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 5 Quality Compounder Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Hidden Gem Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Sustainability leadership in 2024 by progressing toward decarbonisation milestones and recognition in leading global indexes PR Newswire Mon, Dec 30, 2024, 6:12 PM 8 min read 13th consecutive year on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index and 16th straight year on the Asia Pacific Index, following MSCI, FTSE4Good and GRESB accolades Increased focus on identifying and reducing material Scope 3 emissions and heightened efforts to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions SINGAPORE , Dec. 30, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0CapitaLand Investment (CLI), a global real asset manager, has entrenched its position as a world leader in sustainability with its selection as an index company of the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index (DJSI World) and Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific Index (DJSI Asia Pacific) for 2024. \u00a0This marks CLI's13 th and 16 th consecutive year on the DJSI World and Asia Pacific indexes respectively. CLI is the only Singapore -based real estate company listed on DJSI World and DJSI Asia Pacific in 2024 under the \"Real Estate Management and Development\" category, as well as the longest-standing real estate company in Singapore to be listed on DJSI Asia Pacific. \u00a0The listings underline CLI's holistic approach and commitment to sustainability, which includes setting and meeting ambitious ESG targets. The DJSI World and DJSI Asia Pacific indexes comprise the top 10% and 20% of the world's largest companies respectively, based on long-term economic, environmental and social criteria.\u00a0 The indexes serve as benchmarks for investors prioritising sustainable business practices and long-term shareholder value. In addition to the DJSI indexes, CLI remains a constituent of the 2024 MSCI ESG Leaders Index for the 11 th consecutive year, alongside achieving the MSCI ESG AAA rating for the third year.\u00a0 CLI's inclusion in the MSCI Index reflects its dedication to meeting stringent environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards and public disclosures demanded by institutional investors tracking companies' sustainability profiles, which demonstrate their ability to manage sustainability risks and opportunities. CLI has also retained its listing on the FTSE4Good Index Series for the 11 th consecutive year, a testament to its dedication to integrating ESG considerations into its operations and strategy since 2014. In October, CLI and its listed REITs and business trusts achieved leading positions in the 2024 GRESB Real Estate Assessment. CapitaLand India Trust (CLINT), CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (CICT) and CapitaLand China Trust (CLCT)\u00a0achieved the highest 5-star rating for standing investments, while CLI, CapitaLand Ascendas REIT (CLAR) and CapitaLand Ascott Trust (CLAS)\u00a0received a 4-star rating for standing investments. CLAS and CICT were also named Global Listed Sector Leader in their respective categories. Story Continues Mr Vinamra Srivastava , CLI's Chief Sustainability & Sustainable Investments Officer, said: \"2024 was a pivotal year for CLI, with key developments in our decarbonisation strategy, in line with our Sustainability Master Plan 2030. \u00a0Our consistent inclusion in major world indexes like DJSI, MSCI and FTSE4Good, and strong performance in the GRESB assessment demonstrates our unwavering attention to meeting our ESG targets.\" \"We have intensified our decarbonisation initiatives at both asset and tenant operations to minimise our environmental footprint and address the evolving demands of urban environments. \u00a0Notable initiatives include CLINT'S 21MW solar power plant in India and CLI's adoption of the Cooling-as-a-Service system at three flagship properties in Singapore . Our Climate Resilience Report shows how we are prioritising our measures on managing key climate-related risks and opportunities and enhancing sustainability considerations into our business strategies. Our Global Sustainability Report outlines key strategies we will take to reduce Scope 3 carbon emissions while driving measurable reductions in Scope 1 and 2 emissions through targeted, on-the-ground actions. We continue to innovate and collaborate with global partners through platforms such as CapitaLand Sustainability X Challenge (CSXC).\" Focused Approach to Decarbonisation Drive and Reporting Bookending CLI's decarbonisation efforts in 2024 were CapitaLand India Trust's (CLINT) first captive solar power plant in Tamil Nadu, India , which will generate over 30 million kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity annually and meet the power supply needs of 2 million sq ft equivalent of office space; and the launch of the fourth edition of the CapitaLand Sustainability X Challenge (CSXC) , which invites innovators to submit sustainability innovations that tackle key areas of concern in the urban environment, including water conservation and resilience, waste management and circular economy, construction decarbonisation, transiting to a low carbon environment, supply chain, health, safety and wellness in buildings, and tenant engagement on sustainability. This year, CLI also announced its adoption of Cooling-as-a-Service (CaaS) systems in Raffles City Singapore, Plaza Singapura and The Atrium@Orchard, covering 4.8 million square feet (sq ft) of gross floor area (GFA). \u00a0At the three properties, owned by CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (CICT) and managed by CLI, the systems are expected to reduce energy consumption across all three properties by over 30% 1 ,\u00a0and save at least 118,680 tonnes of carbon emissions over the 15-year operating period 2 .\u00a0Annually, the energy saved can power more than 4,800 four-room HDB flats 3 . 1 This is in comparison to total energy consumption in 2023. 2 Emission factors used for computation of 2023 emissions were from IEA 2023 v1.1 (AR4 Applied) 3 The average household electricity consumption is based on the Energy Market Authority's statistics. In 2024, CLI published its first-ever standalone Climate Resilience Report (CRR)\u00a0aligned with the Task Force on Climate-related\u00a0Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in March, and its 15th Global Sustainability Report (GSR 2023) in May, with heightened disclosures on its material Scope 3 indicators. The Climate Resilience Report, CLI's third climate scenario analysis, is a comprehensive climate scenario analysis of its diversified portfolio of more than 480 properties in 20 countries 4 across various asset classes. \u00a0The report provides critical insights on the extent of the impact of the various physical and transition risks while enabling relevant teams to make informed decisions on directing green capital expenditure towards parts of the business with significant risk exposure, building resilience and reducing vulnerability of identified properties. CLI's GSR 2023 incorporates three new Scope 3 categories deemed material to its operations following the latest review of its full inventory of Scope 3 emissions, emissions hotspots and key decarbonisation levers across its value chain. \u00a0The report also highlights CLI's progress in reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity and managing climate-related risks as it strives towards its Net Zero targets. Underpinning CLI's active contribution to global sustainability efforts in an urban environment is its involvement in the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).\u00a0 As an SBTi Expert Advisory Group member since 2021, CLI plays a pivotal role in shaping science-based target-setting methodologies for the real estate sector and its stakeholders. CLI was the only Singapore real asset company shortlisted for the SBTi Building Sector Guidance, actively contributing to the final publication by using its global portfolio performance as a test bed to qualify the criteria.

{"text": "Clarus Expands Adventure Lineup With RockyMounts Acquisition Zacks Equity Research Tue, Dec 10, 2024, 4:37 PM 3 min read In This Article: CLAR -5.76% Clarus Corporation \u2019s CLAR Rhino-Rack recently announced the acquisition of certain assets of the Colorado-based RockyMounts. The initiative highlights Clarus\u2019 commitment to bolstering its adventure portfolio and addressing key growth areas. While the transaction was funded using cash on hand, terms remain undisclosed. How CLAR Will Benefit From the Buyout Renowned for its bicycle transport products, RockyMounts has built a strong reputation for its premium roof and hitch rack solutions. Its offerings include innovative designs, durability and compatibility with various vehicles, including SUVs, vans and trucks. RockyMounts\u2019 products are widely available across local and national retailers in North America. Clarus has identified bicycle racks as a key product category in its strategic roadmap. The addition of RockyMounts is expected to broaden the company\u2019s addressable market, particularly in the bike rack and hitch-based products segment. The acquisition aims to enhance brand penetration in the U.S. market while providing Rhino-Rack a gateway to introduce a new product category in Australia. Furthermore, the integration of RockyMounts is anticipated to deliver immediate scale and strengthen Clarus\u2019 competitive position in the outdoor gear space. Mathew Hayward, Managing Director of Clarus\u2019 Adventure segment, emphasized the synergy between the two brands. The company is optimistic about RockyMounts\u2019 innovative product line and strong customer base to drive growth in the coming periods. CLAR Stock Price Performance Shares of CLAR have declined 23.6% in the past six months against the industry\u2019s growth of 23%. Constrained consumer spending and market softness in key regions such as North America and Australia primarily caused the downside. During the third quarter of 2024, the Outdoor segment revenues declined year over year, while the Adventure segment faced a September slowdown due to external factors, including supply chain disruptions and weak automotive markets. While Clarus is making strides to build a more profitable business with initiatives like the new product development process and digital transformation, these efforts are unlikely to yield significant benefits until 2025 and beyond. Due to softer global revenues and the continued investments in the Adventure segment to scale the business, CLAR expects 2024 adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $7 to $9 million. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The company expects Adventure segment revenues to be approximately $78 million in 2024, reflecting a $12 million reduction from earlier guidance. This decline is attributed to delays in purchases by wholesale and OEM partners, slower-than-anticipated adoption of e-commerce initiatives and continued market softness in the United States. Story Continues The company\u2019s reliance on a turnaround strategy amid ongoing market headwinds and operational challenges suggests limited upside potential in the near term. Earnings estimates for 2025 have declined in the past 30 days. CLAR\u2019s Zacks Rank & Key Picks Clarus currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

That is because the Jan. 17, 2025 $30.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. What is Implied Volatility? Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy. What do the Analysts Think? Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Clarus shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Clarus is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Leisure and Recreation Products industry that ranks in the Bottom 36% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while three analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 13 cents per share to 7 cents in that period. Given the way analysts feel about Clarus right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected. Looking to Trade Options?
