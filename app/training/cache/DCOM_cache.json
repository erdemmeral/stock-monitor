Q & A Highlights Q : Can you confirm the guidance for non-interest income for 2025? A : Yes, the guidance for non-interest income is $40 million to $42 million for 2025. This increase is primarily due to the BOLI restructuring, which will add approximately $5 million to $5.5 million in income. Story Continues Q : What is the expected loan growth for 2025, and what factors are influencing this? A : We expect low single-digit loan growth in 2025. This is due to higher levels of payoffs and refinances, particularly in the CRE and multifamily sectors, which offset new business-related loans. Q : Are there any plans for acquisitions given your outstanding CRA rating? A : We are open to strategic opportunities that enhance franchise value, particularly within the Tri-state area. However, we are also focused on significant organic growth with new teams and capital to support this. Q : Can you provide details on the $1.9 billion of fixed-rate loans maturing in the second half of 2025 and 2026? A : Approximately $600 million will mature in the second half of 2025 at a rate of 4.25%, with the remaining $1.3 billion maturing in 2026 at a rate of 3.85%. Q : How are you managing deposit costs in light of recent Federal Reserve rate cuts? A : We have been able to reduce deposit costs effectively, with new deposits coming in at a blended rate of 2% to 2.5%. Our overall cost of deposits is currently in the 2% to 2.5% range. Q : What is the outlook for charge-offs and credit quality in 2025? A : We expect charge-offs to be in the range of 20 to 30 basis points, consistent with a commercial bank's typical range. We are not seeing any concerning trends in credit quality at this time. Q : How do you see the non-bank sector impacting the CRE market? A : Non-bank entities are becoming more active in financing CRE and multifamily opportunities. However, we expect banks to re-enter the CRE market as they adjust their CRE ratios. Q : What are your expectations for deposit growth and composition in 2025? A : We anticipate solid deposit growth, with a focus on maintaining and potentially increasing our DDA percentage, which is currently at 30%. We expect business deposits to continue growing, supported by new account openings and pipelines. For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .

Most Undervalued Bank Stock to Invest in According to Analysts? Zarah Hamid Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 5:11 PM 4 min read In This Article: DCOM -1.38% We recently published a list of 10 Most Undervalued Bank Stocks To Invest In According To Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Dime Community Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:DCOM) stands against other most undervalued bank stocks to invest in according to analysts. The Banking Industry\u2019s Outlook Under the Trump Admin Amidst the enthusiasm of the new President Donald Trump for digital assets, it is important to know that US banks have avoided allowing customers to use crypto for retail transactions. Regarding the banking industry\u2019s approach to digital currencies, the CEO of Bank of America, Brian Moynihan, told CNBC that if the regulators allow, the American banking industry would jump into crypto payments. Speaking on this stance, Moynihan stated: \u201cIf you go down the street here and you go in and buy lunch, right, if you can pay with\u00a0Visa,\u00a0Mastercard, a debit card,\u00a0Apple\u00a0Pay, etc., this would just be another form of payment\u201d At the same time, Trump\u2019s lighter regulatory approach is expected to reduce some of the burden on the banking industry imposed by Biden\u2019s administration and is likely to spur dealmaking. Barclays senior equity analyst Jason Goldberg told Yahoo Finance that the environment is a \u2018pro-growth, less regulation backdrop\u2019 and favorable for increased loan growth and enhanced capital market activity among banks. JPMorgan\u2019s Mary Erdoes expressed optimism for deals in the banking industry under the new admin, saying: \u201cCompanies don\u2019t want to go public or can\u2019t go public because of the heavy regulatory burden and hopefully you\u2019ll see that [change]\u201d With increased mergers and acquisitions being anticipated in the United States under the new administration, CNBC mentioned European banking leaders hoping for more deal-making activity on the continent. The chief executive of the largest bank in the Netherlands, ING, is of the opinion that too many banks in Europe deem the sector inefficient. In comparison to the US, fragmented laws across Europe tend to prevent a more efficient banking system. Simultaneously, the chief executive of Swiss bank UBS, Sergio Ermotti, thinks the policy stance taken by regulators under Trump would encourage deal-making among several small and regional banks while he considers the US authorities unlikely to weaken regulations for larger banks.

Strong Growth in Deposits, Business Loans and Capital Ratios on a Year-Over-Year Basis Net Interest Margin Expands by 29 basis points on a Linked Quarter Basis to 2.79% HAUPPAUGE, N.Y., Jan. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dime Community Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ: DCOM) (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cDime\u201d), the parent company of Dime Community Bank (the \u201cBank\u201d), today reported net income available to common stockholders of $21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, or $0.55 per diluted common share, compared to net income available to common stockholders of $88.8 million, or $2.29 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2023. Stuart H. Lubow, President and Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) of the Company, stated, \u201cOur fourth quarter results were marked by continued core deposit growth and Net Interest Margin (\u201cNIM\u201d) expansion. In addition, we successfully executed on several important initiatives in the fourth quarter, including a follow-on common equity offering. The proceeds from the offering were utilized to re-position our available-for-sale securities portfolio and Bank Owned Life Insurance (\u201cBOLI\u201d) portfolio and supplement our capital base. These transactions will contribute towards a stronger balance sheet, enhanced earnings power and support future growth. I would like to thank all of our employees for their tremendous efforts throughout the year that led to substantial year-over-year growth in core deposits and business loans as well as the Bank achieving an \u201cOutstanding\u201d rating on our recent Community Reinvestment Act examination.\u201d For the quarter ended December 31, 2024, net loss available to common stockholders was $22.2 million, or $(0.54) per diluted common share, compared to net income available to common stockholders of $11.5 million, or $0.29 per diluted common share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and net income available to common stockholders of $14.5 million, or $0.37 per diluted common share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Fourth quarter 2024 results included: $42.8 million of pre-tax loss-on-sale of securities, $1.3 million of pre-tax severance expense and $1.2 million of pre-tax expense related to the termination of a legacy pension plan. In addition, the fourth quarter 2024 results included $9.1 million of income tax expense related to the taxable gain and Modified Endowment Contract Tax (\u201cMEC Tax\u201d) on the surrender of legacy BOLI assets. Adjusted net income available to common stockholders (non-GAAP) totaled $17.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, an increase of 52% versus the prior quarter and an increase of 16% versus the year ago quarter (see \u201cNon-GAAP Reconciliation\u201d tables at the end of this news release). Adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) totaled $0.42 per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, an increase of 45% versus the prior quarter and an increase of 8% versus the year ago quarter. Story Continues Highlights for the Fourth Quarter of 2024 Included: Total deposits increased $268.8 million compared to the third quarter of 2024; Core deposits (excluding brokered and time deposits) increased $513.4 million compared to the third quarter of 2024; The ratio of average non-interest-bearing deposits to average total deposits for the fourth quarter increased to 30.0%; The cost of total deposits declined by 37 basis points versus the prior quarter; The net interest margin increased to 2.79% for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to 2.50% for the prior quarter; The loan to deposit ratio declined to 93.0% at the end of the fourth quarter compared to 95.4% for the prior quarter; The allowance for credit losses to total loans increased to 0.82% at the end of the fourth quarter compared to 0.78% for the prior quarter; The Company\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio increased to 11.07% at the end of the fourth quarter; and The Bank received an \u201cOutstanding\u201d overall rating as well as an \u201cOutstanding\u201d rating on each of the individual components (Lending, Investment and Service tests) for its recently concluded Community Reinvestment Act examination. Management\u2019s Discussion of Quarterly Operating Results Net Interest Income Net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $91.1 million compared to $79.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 and $74.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Mr. Lubow commented, \u201cStrong growth in core deposits as well as proactive management of deposit rates led to strong linked quarter growth in our net interest margin. We anticipate the full quarter impact of the securities repositioning (which was completed towards the end of November) to positively benefit the NIM in 2025.\u201d The table below provides a reconciliation of the reported net interest margin (\u201cNIM\u201d) and adjusted NIM excluding the impact of purchase accounting accretion on the loan portfolio. (Dollars in thousands) Q4 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2023 Net interest income $ 91,098 $ 79,924 $ 74,121 Purchase accounting amortization (accretion) on loans (\"PAA\") (1,268 ) (266 ) (55 ) Adjusted net interest income excluding PAA on loans (non-GAAP) $ 89,830 $ 79,658 $ 74,066 Average interest-earning assets $ 12,974,958 $ 12,734,246 $ 12,828,060 NIM (1) 2.79 % 2.50 % 2.29 % Adjusted NIM excluding PAA on loans (non-GAAP) (2) 2.75 % 2.49 % 2.29 % (1) NIM represents net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. (2) Adjusted NIM excluding PAA on loans represents adjusted net interest income, which excludes PAA amortization on acquired loans divided by average interest-earning assets. Loan Portfolio The ending weighted average rate (\u201cWAR\u201d) on the total loan portfolio was 5.26% at December 31, 2024, a 14 basis point decrease compared to the ending WAR of 5.40% on the total loan portfolio at September 30, 2024. The linked quarter decline in the WAR on the loan portfolio was primarily due to floating rate loans adjusting lower as a result of the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate cuts. Outlined below are loan balances and WARs for the quarter ended as indicated.

( 4 ) While the loans within this category are often considered \"commercial real estate\" in nature, multifamily and loans underlying cooperatives are reported separately from commercial real estate loans in order to emphasize the residential nature of the collateral underlying this significant component of the total loan portfolio. Outlined below are the loan originations, for the quarter ended as indicated. (Dollars in millions) Q4 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2023 Loan originations $ 187.5 $ 122.7 $ 195.9 Deposits and Borrowed Funds Period end total deposits (including mortgage escrow deposits) at December 31, 2024 were $11.69 billion, compared to $11.42 billion at September 30, 2024 and $10.53 billion at December 31, 2023. Total Federal Home Loan Bank advances were $608.0 million at December 31, 2024 compared to $508.0 million at September 30, 2024 and $1.31 billion at December 31, 2023. Mr. Lubow commented, \u201cOver the course of 2024, we made significant progress in re-creating a core-deposit funded balance sheet. Strong growth in core business deposits allowed us to reduce our FHLB advance position by approximately $700 million on a year-over-year basis and our brokered deposit position by approximately $475 million on a year-over-year basis.\u201d Non-Interest Income Non-interest income was a loss of $33.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to income of $7.6 million during the third quarter of 2024, and income of $8.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2023. Fourth quarter 2024 results included $42.8 million of pre-tax loss-on-sale of securities related to the re-positioning of the available-for-sale securities portfolio. Non-Interest Expense Total non-interest expense was $60.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2024, $57.7 million during the third quarter of 2024, and $53.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding the impact of the loss on extinguishment of debt, amortization of other intangible assets, severance expense, settlement loss related to the termination of a legacy pension plan, and the FDIC special assessment, adjusted non-interest expense was $57.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2024, $57.4 million during the third quarter of 2024, and $52.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2023 (see \u201cNon-GAAP Reconciliation\u201d tables at the end of this news release). Mr. Lubow commented, \u201cIn line with our previous guidance, our adjusted non-interest expense base was relatively flat in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the prior quarter.\u201d The ratio of non-interest expense to average assets was 1.76% during the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to 1.71% during the linked quarter and 1.58% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding the impact of the loss on extinguishment of debt, amortization of other intangible assets, severance expense, the FDIC special assessment and settlement loss related to the termination of a legacy pension plan, the ratio of adjusted non-interest expense to average assets was 1.68% during the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to 1.70% during the linked quarter and 1.54% for the fourth quarter of 2023 (see \u201cNon-GAAP Reconciliation\u201d tables at the end of this news release). The efficiency ratio was 105.9% during the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to 65.9% during the linked quarter and 65.0% during the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding the impact of net (gain) loss on sale of securities and other assets, fair value change in equity securities and loans held for sale, severance expense, the FDIC special assessment, settlement loss related to the termination of a legacy pension plan, loss on extinguishment of debt and amortization of other intangible assets the adjusted efficiency ratio was 58.0% during the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to 65.6% during the linked quarter and 63.6% during the fourth quarter of 2023 (see \u201cNon-GAAP Reconciliation\u201d tables at the end of this news release). Income Tax Expense The fourth quarter of 2024 income tax expense was $3.3 million, inclusive of $9.1 million of income tax expense related to the taxable gain and MEC Tax on the surrender of legacy BOLI assets. Excluding the tax impact of the BOLI surrender, the fourth quarter 2024 effective rate was a tax benefit of 33.5%. This compares to an effective tax rate of 26.9% for the third quarter of 2024, and 35.6% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Credit Quality Non-performing loans were $49.5 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $49.5 million at September 30, 2024 and $29.1 million at December 31, 2023. A credit loss provision of $13.7 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to a credit loss provision of $11.6 million during the third quarter of 2024, and a credit loss provision of $3.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2023. Capital Management Stockholders\u2019 equity increased $170.3 million to $1.40 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to $1.23 billion at December 31, 2023. The growth primarily reflects retained earnings and the $135.8 million in net proceeds raised in connection with the November 2024 common equity offering. The Company\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s regulatory capital ratios continued to be in excess of all applicable regulatory requirements as of December 31, 2024. All risk-based regulatory capital ratios increased in the fourth quarter of 2024. Mr. Lubow commented, \u201cDuring the fourth quarter we raised $136 million of net proceeds from a common equity offering. Our capital ratios are now best-in-class when compared to other community and regional banks in our footprint with over $10 billion of assets.\u201d Dividends per common share were $0.25 during the fourth and third quarters of 2024, respectively. Book value per common share was $29.34 at December 31, 2024 compared to $29.31 at September 30, 2024. Tangible common book value per share (which represents common equity less goodwill and other intangible assets, divided by the number of shares outstanding) was $25.68 at December 31, 2024 compared to $25.22 at September 30, 2024 (see \u201cNon-GAAP Reconciliation\u201d tables at the end of this news release).

A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are required to be disclosed in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the United States. The Company\u2019s management believes the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with a greater understanding of the Company\u2019s operating results in addition to the results measured in accordance with GAAP. While management uses these non-GAAP measures in its analysis of the Company\u2019s performance, this information should not be viewed as a substitute for financial results determined in accordance with GAAP or considered to be more important than financial results determined in accordance with GAAP. The following non-GAAP financial measures exclude pre-tax income and expenses associated with the fair value change in equity securities and loans held for sale, net loss (gain) on sale of securities and other assets, severance, the FDIC special assessment, loss on extinguishment of debt and loss due to pension settlement. The non-GAAP financial measures also include taxes related to the surrender of BOLI assets.
