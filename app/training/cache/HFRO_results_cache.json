[{"text": "Highland Opportunities and Income Fund (HFRO) Announces Tender Offer for Common Shares in Exchange for up to $100 Million in Preferred Shares PR Newswire Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 5:00 PM 5 min read In This Article: HFRO -0.52% HFRO-PA -0.24% DALLAS , Nov. 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Highland Opportunities and Income Fund (NYSE:HFRO) (\"HFRO\" or the \"Fund\") today announced its plan to conduct an issuer tender offer pursuant to Rule 13e-4 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for its common shares (\"Shares\") with a maximum aggregate purchase price of\u00a0$100 million, in exchange for Series B Preferred Shares (the \"Tender Offer\"). The expected exchange price for the Tender Offer is $10.00 per Share, which represents a significant premium to the current Share price. The Fund's Board of Trustees (the \"Board\") authorized the Tender Offer on November 22, 2024 . The Tender Offer is expected to commence in January 2025 . It is anticipated that the Series B Preferred Shares to be issued will be structured similarly to the existing 5.375% Series A Cumulative Preferred Shares (NYSE:HFRO.PR.A) and be rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\"). The Fund will not issue fractional Series B Preferred Shares. The Tender Offer is part of the ongoing, targeted strategy from the Fund's adviser, NexPoint Asset Management, L.P. (the \"Adviser\"), and the Board to address the Share price's discount to net asset value (\"NAV\"). This strategy has to date comprised several initiatives, including a share buyback program and a significant commitment to providing enhanced disclosures through shareholder materials, quarterly calls, and other communications from the Adviser that offer insights and timely updates on the Fund and portfolio, as well as in-depth information on top holdings. Taking into account the impact of these efforts and feedback received from HFRO shareholders, the Tender Offer expands on current initiatives while providing an additional solution that aims to narrow the discount to NAV and provide other benefits to shareholders. Tender Offer's Potential Benefits to Shareholders Both the Adviser and the Board believe the Tender Offer is in the best interest of all shareholders for several reasons, including the following: It has the potential to narrow the discount to\u00a0NAV. The Tender Offer has the potential to narrow the discount to NAV as it is expected to increase the NAV per Share of the Fund for Shares that remain outstanding after the completion of the Tender Offer. It provides an opportunity to exchange common shares at a premium to the current market price. The Tender Offer allows a significant number of shareholders to exchange their Shares at a premium to the current market price. With an anticipated Exchange Price per Common Share of $10.00 , this represents a premium to the latest closing price of $5.21 per Share (as of November 22, 2024 ). While the exchange price is subject to change between now and the formal commencement of the Tender Offer, such price will be reflected in the Tender Offer documents, will reflect a premium to current trading price, and will not alter the maximum aggregate purchase price of $100 million in Series B Preferred Shares for the exchange. It allows shareholders to receive a fixed dividend. Preferred shareholders will receive a fixed dividend based on the coupon of 5.375%. Story Continues Terms of the Proposed Tender Offer The complete details of the offering will be provided in the final offering documents once they are filed; however, based on current conditions, the Fund anticipates the Tender Offer will have the following terms: Exchange Price per Common Share $10.00 Maximum Aggregate Purchase Price $100 million Coupon of Series B Preferred Shares 5.375\u00a0% Liquidation Preference of Series B Preferred Shares $25.00 per share The final terms are subject to change. The offering documents are expected to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\")\u00a0in January 2025 .

WHITE proxy Card Will Help Ensure that Shareholders Realize the Significant Value Expected from UDF IV\u2019s Transaction with Ready Capital Troubling Pattern of Value Destruction at NexPoint-Managed Funds Should Raise Concerns for Shareholders Visit UDFForshareholders.com for Voting Instructions and Other Information IRVING, Texas, Dec. 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- United Development Funding IV (\u201cUDF IV\u201d or the \u201cTrust\u201d) today reminds all shareholders to vote on the WHITE proxy card \u201cFOR\u201d the Board\u2019s four highly qualified nominees - Steven J. Finkle, Lawrence S. Jones, J. Heath Malone and Phillip K. Marshall - in advance of the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the \u201cAnnual Meeting\u201d), which will be held on December 10, 2024. Shareholders are encouraged to visit UDFForShareholders.com for more information and voting instructions. As shareholders consider their vote, UDF IV reminds them that: On December 2, UDF IV announced that it has entered into an agreement to be acquired by Ready Capital Corporation (RC) (\u201cReady Capital\u201d), a leading multi-strategy real estate finance company. UDF IV shareholders may receive up to $5.89 per share as a result of the transaction with Ready Capital through a combination of pre-closing distributions of UDF IV\u2019s balance sheet cash up to $2.44 per share; 0.416 shares issued by Ready Capital at the transaction closing per UDF IV share, with an implied value of $3.07 per share based on Ready Capital\u2019s closing share price on November 29, 2024; and contingent value rights issued by Ready Capital at the transaction closing to receive contingent consideration over time estimated to be up to $0.38 per UDF IV share. This consideration is more than five times the bargain basement price of $1.10 per share that NexPoint Real Estate Opportunities, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of NexPoint Diversified Real Estate Trust (NXDT, and collectively with its affiliates, \u201cNexPoint\u201d) offered UDF IV shareholders in its unsuccessful attempt to take control of the Trust just a few years ago. If NexPoint gains control of the Board and the Trust, NexPoint will be in a position to deprive shareholders of the value and liquidity you will receive from the Ready Capital transaction the current Board has negotiated and approved. Do not be misled \u2013 supporting NexPoint\u2019s dissident trustees will enable NexPoint to continue to implement what we expect will be a self-serving, value destructive agenda. NexPoint has not presented a single viable plan that we believe would enhance value. NexPoint\u2019s nominations for a controlling slate of dissident trustees at the Annual Meeting is part of an ongoing, self-interested campaign, which we believe is aimed at extracting the value of the Trust\u2019s portfolio for its own benefit and to the detriment of all other shareholders. There is a troubling pattern of value destruction at funds managed by NexPoint. Shareholders are encouraged to read the full letter which outlines the recent poor performance and stock price declines at NexPoint-managed funds, including: NXDT, which continues to perform poorly, with losses of over $246 million since July 2022 and a 60% share price decline over the two year period ending November 21, 2024; and An affiliated NexPoint-managed fund, Highland Opportunities and Income Fund (HFRO), whose stock price similarly declined approximately 54% over the two year period ending November 21, 2024 and was recently trading near its all-time low. Story Continues The Future of Your Investment in UDF IV is at Stake \u2013 Vote on the WHITE proxy card TODAY to Protect Your Investment Remember that only your latest dated proxy counts and that a vote on the green proxy card to \u201cWITHHOLD\u201d on the NexPoint nominees could revoke your votes \u201cFOR\u201d the UDF IV nominees on the WHITE proxy card. Please simply discard any green proxy card sent to you by NexPoint and vote every UDF IV WHITE proxy card you receive as you may hold your shares in multiple accounts. Shareholders have the opportunity to allow UDF IV to continue its work to protect and enhance shareholder value by reelecting the four independent Trustees - Steven J. Finkle, Lawrence S. Jones, J. Heath Malone and Phillip K. Marshall - who oversee our efforts to protect the value of your investment. We urge you to vote \u201cFOR\u201d ONLY the four nominees proposed by the Board of Trustees on the WHITE proxy card included in the enclosed UDF IV proxy materials. UDF IV shareholders with questions or who require assistance with respect to voting their shares are encouraged to contact UDF IV\u2019s proxy solicitor: INNISFREE M&A INCORPORATED Shareholders may call: 1 (877) 750-9496 (toll-free from the U.S. and Canada) +1 (412) 232-3651 (from other countries) ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE TRANSACTION WITH READY CAPITAL The Ready Capital transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to the approval of UDF IV shareholders and other customary closing conditions.

NexPoint\u2019s Value Destruction in Letter to Shareholders United Development Funding IV Fri, Nov 22, 2024, 5:00 PM 3 min read Highlights Poor Share Price Performance at Multiple NexPoint-Managed Funds Reiterates Concerns Regarding the Motivation of NexPoint\u2019s Disruptive Campaign and the Potentially Disastrous Implications for UDF IV Shareholders if Successful Urges Shareholders to Vote FOR the Board\u2019s Highly Qualified Trustee Nominees on the WHITE Proxy Card IRVING, Texas, Nov. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- United Development Funding IV (\u201cUDF IV\u201d or the \u201cTrust\u201d) mailed a letter to shareholders disclosing a troubling pattern of value destruction at funds managed by affiliates of NexPoint Real Estate Opportunities, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of NexPoint Diversified Real Estate Trust (NXDT, and collectively with its affiliates, \u201cNexPoint\u201d). Shareholders are encouraged to read the full letter which outlines the recent poor performance and stock price declines at NexPoint-managed funds, including: NXDT, which continues to perform poorly, with losses of over $246 million since July 2022 and a 60% share price decline since November 2022 Another NexPoint-managed fund, Highland Opportunities and Income Fund (HFRO), whose stock price similarly declined approximately 54% since November 2022 and is currently trading near its all-time low NexPoint Hospitality Trust (NHT.U), which is externally advised by NexPoint Real Estate Advisors VI, L.P., was quoted on its own website at $0.01 per share on November 8, 2024 The letter also reiterates UDF IV\u2019s concerns regarding NexPoint\u2019s motivations given its multi-year campaign to take over management of the Trust, causing significant disruption to the Trust\u2019s operations and undermining shareholders\u2019 interests. UDF IV also continues to monitor a shareholder class action lawsuit relating to the sale of Jernigan Capital to NexPoint that names James Dondero, NexPoint\u2019s founder, and John Good, one of the trustee candidates that NexPoint has nominated for election to the UDF IV Board, as defendants, and raises serious concerns regarding allegedly false and misleading disclosures. UDF IV urges shareholders to help the Board prevent NexPoint from succeeding in its nefarious and self-interested campaign by voting \u201cFOR\u201d on the WHITE proxy card to reelect the Board\u2019s highly qualified nominees who have acted to protect shareholders\u2019 interests. UDF IV shareholders with questions or who require assistance with respect to voting their shares are encouraged to contact UDF IV\u2019s proxy solicitor: INNISFREE M&A INCORPORATED Shareholders may call: 1 (877) 750-9496 (toll-free from the U.S. and Canada) +1 (412) 232-3651 (from other countries) Story Continues About United Development Funding IV United Development Funding IV is a Maryland real estate investment trust.
