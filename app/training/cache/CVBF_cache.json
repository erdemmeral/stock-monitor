Q & A Highlights Q : Have you started to see improving demand and accelerating loan growth in your pipeline for 2025? A : Yes, there is a sense of optimism going forward. We have had a good start to the year on the loan front, with improving pipelines, although not yet at desired levels. There is enthusiasm among clients, and we believe we can execute on loan growth as customers revisit shelved plans. Story Continues Q : How do you plan to deploy capital, and are buybacks or additional restructurings on the table? A : We aim to utilize capital for internal growth and are actively engaging in M&A conversations. Although there is often a disconnect between what sellers expect and what we are willing to pay, we are optimistic about executing something in 2025. We also have a 10b5-1 plan for opportunistic buybacks. Q : Have you received any pushback from clients regarding interest-bearing deposit costs, and what is your outlook for core deposit growth? A : We have grown deposits by 3.3% on a 5-year cumulative average growth rate. We are confident in our ability to grow deposits, especially with optimism in the market. We continue to drive growth in our Specialty Banking and government services groups, and we are optimistic about deposit growth as customers start new projects. Q : Can you provide insights on the timing of rate reductions for deposits and your outlook for deposit costs in 2025? A : The cost of nonmaturity deposits will likely continue to decline in the near term, with some lag from the last Fed cut in December. We expect a slight decline in deposit costs over the next month or two, after which it will likely level out if the Fed does not make further cuts. Q : What is your perspective on the outlook for California, given challenges like population outflows and wildfires? A : Despite challenges, California remains a large and diversified economy with significant market share opportunities for us. While there is out-migration, many businesses remain in California, and we continue to see opportunities to attract clients. We are optimistic about our prospects in the state.

Estimates Zacks Equity Research Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 2:05 AM 3 min read In This Article: CVBF -2.35% CVB Financial (CVBF) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.36 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.34 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.39 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5.88%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this bank holding company would post earnings of $0.35 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.37, delivering a surprise of 5.71%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. CVB Financial , which belongs to the Zacks Banks - West industry, posted revenues of $123.52 million for the quarter ended December 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.55%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $138.52 million. The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. CVB Financial shares have lost about 3.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.9%. What's Next for CVB Financial? While CVB Financial has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for CVB Financial: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

This represented a $3.2 million, or 2.82%, decrease from the third quarter of 2024, and a $8.9 million, or 7.49%, decrease from the fourth quarter of 2023. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in net interest income was due to a $18.2 million decrease in interest income resulting from a $974 million average decrease in earning assets and a 19 basis point decline in our earning asset yield. The decline in earning assets was primarily a result of a $747 million decrease in interest-earning balances due from the Federal Reserve. The decrease in balances held at the Federal Reserve were the result of the $1.3 billion redemption of a Bank Term Fund Program (BTFP) advance at the end of the third quarter of 2024, which resulted in average total borrowings declining by $1.22 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024. The decline in interest income was partially offset by $15 million decrease in interest expense, including the $14.9 million lower interest on borrowings from the redemption of the BTFP advance. The decline in net interest income compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily due to a $10.5 million decrease in interest income resulting from a $684 million decrease in average earning assets and a 6 basis point decline in our earning asset yield. Interest expense decreased by $1.5 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily due to $1.1 billion in lower average borrowings in the fourth quarter of 2024. Net interest income of $447.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, decreased $40.6 million, or 8.33%, compared to the same period of 2023. Interest income increased by $23.8 million, while interest expense grew by $64.4 million from 2023. Growth in interest income was primarily due to a 25 basis point increase in the earning asset yield. Interest expense on deposits and customer repurchase agreements increased by $57.8 million, primarily due to a 49 basis point increase in the cost of deposits and repurchase agreements. Average borrowings grew by $163.6 million year over year, resulting in a $6.1 million increase in interest expense. Overall, cost of funds grew from 0.83% for 2023 to 1.32% in 2024. Net Interest Margin Our tax equivalent net interest margin was 3.18% for the fourth quarter and 3.05% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 3.26% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Fourth quarter cost of funds decreased 34 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by a 19 basis point decrease in our interest-earning asset yield. Our cost of funds decreased from 1.47% in the third quarter of 2024 to 1.13% in the fourth quarter, as average borrowings declined quarter over quarter by $1.2 billion. The cost of borrowings decreased from 4.77% in the third quarter of 2024 to 4.62% in the fourth quarter due to the redemption of a $1.3 billion BTFP advance in September 2024. In addition, cost of deposits and customer repurchase agreements decreased by four basis points to 0.97% for the fourth quarter of 2024. The 19 basis point quarter over quarter decrease in our interest-earning asset yield was primarily due to a 16 basis point decrease in loan yields and an 80 basis point decrease in the positive carry on fair value hedging instruments that pay a fixed interest rate and receive daily SOFR. These swaps originally had a total notional value of $1 billion, of which $700 million remained outstanding at December 31, 2024. A $300 million swap that matured in 2027 was terminated in December of 2024. The fourth quarter yield on funds on deposit at the Federal Reserve decreased by 50 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2024, although these funds decreased as a percentage of earnings assets to 3.5%, from 8.2% in the prior quarter. Net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2024 decreased by 8 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, as a result of lower interest earning asset yields that declined by 6 basis points and a 4 basis point increase in funding costs. Earning asset yields declined from 4.30% in the fourth quarter of 2023 to 4.24% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The lower earning asset yields included lower loan yields, which declined from 5.18% for the fourth quarter of 2023 to 5.15% for the fourth quarter of 2024, as well as a 66 basis point quarter over quarter decrease in the positive carry on fair value hedging instruments. Funds on deposit at the Federal Reserve yielded 100 basis points less than the prior year quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, the cost of deposits and customer repurchase agreements increased by 36 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2024, but cost of funds only increased by 4 basis points due to a $1.1 billion decrease in average borrowings. Earning Assets and Deposits On average, total earning assets declined by $974 million, or 6.52%, compared to the third quarter of 2024 and declined by $684 million, or 4.67% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. The quarter-over-quarter decrease includes a $747 million decrease in average funds on deposit at the Federal Reserve, $143.5 million decline in average investment securities, and a $82.7 million decrease in average loans outstanding. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, the decrease in earnings assets was primarily due to a $328.1 million decline in average loans outstanding and a $391.7 million decrease in total investment securities.\u00a0\u00a0 Total deposits and customer repurchase agreements increased on average by $150.5 million compared to the third quarter of 2024 and increased on average by $115.3 million from the fourth quarter of 2023. Noninterest-bearing deposits declined on average by $8.9 million, or 0.12%, from the third quarter of 2024 and by $334.8 million, or 4.5%, from the fourth quarter of 2023. On average, noninterest-bearing deposits were 58.7% of total deposits for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to 59.10% for the third quarter of 2024 and 61.30% in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Allowance for credit losses represented 0.94% of gross loans at December 31, 2024, compared to 0.97% at September 30, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded a $3.0 million recapture of provision for credit losses, compared to a $2 million provision for credit loss for 2023. Noninterest Income Noninterest income was $13.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared with $12.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 and $19.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Bank executed sale-leaseback transactions with the sale of two buildings, that were simultaneously leased back, resulting in a pre-tax net gain of $16.8 million. The gains on selling the buildings were offset by realizing a pre-tax net loss of $16.7 million on the sale of $155 million of AFS securities. Fourth quarter income from Bank Owned Life Insurance (\u201cBOLI\u201d) decreased by $1.1 million from the third quarter of 2024 and decreased by $5.5 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, which was primarily due to $6.5 million of income from the surrender and redeployment of the BOLI policies at the end 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2024, noninterest income was $54.5 million, compared to $59.3 million for 2023. Noninterest income in 2024 included a total pre-tax gain of $25.9 million from the sale-leaseback of four locations partially offset by pre-tax loss of $28.3 million from the sale of $467 million of AFS securities while 2023 included a $2.6 million gain from an equity fund distribution. Trust and investment income for 2024 grew by $1.2 million, or 9.34%, from the prior year. Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $58.5 million, compared to $58.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 and $65.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. The quarter-over-quarter decrease included a $650,000 decrease in staff related expense, offset by an increase in expense of $750,000 due to the recapture of provision for unfunded loan commitments in the third quarter of 2024. Noninterest expense decreased by $7.4 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily due to $9.2 million FDIC special assessment in the fourth quarter of 2023. Partially offsetting the impact of lower regulatory assessment expense were increases of $346,000 in staff related expenses, $342,000 increase in occupancy expenses and an increase in expense due to a $500,000 recapture of provision for unfunded loan commitments in the fourth quarter of 2023. The efficiency ratio was 47.34% for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to 47.60% for the same period of 2023. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2024 was 25.25% and was 26% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared with 34.97% for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 29.80% for year-to-date 2023. The fourth quarter of 2023 effective tax rate was impacted by the surrender of certain BOLI policies. Our estimated annual effective tax rate can vary depending upon the level of tax-advantaged income from municipal securities and BOLI, as well as available tax credits.

Including the sale of AFS securities during the third quarter of 2024, total book value of AFS securities sold during the second half of 2024 was $467.0 million, resulting in a cumulative net pre-tax loss of $28.3 million. At December 31, 2024, investment securities held-to-maturity (\u201cHTM\u201d) totaled $2.38 billion, a decrease of $25.6 million, or 1.06%, from September 30, 2024, and a decrease of $84.9 million, or 3.45%, from December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2024, the Company had $316.2 million of Bank Owned Life insurance (\u201cBOLI\u201d), compared to $316.6 million at September 30, 2024 and $308.7 million at December 31, 2023. The Bank completed a restructuring of the Company\u2019s life insurance policies at the end of 2023, which resulted to $4.5 million write-down in value on surrender policies that was offset by a $10.9 million enhancement to cash surrender values, as well as additional policy purchases totaling $41 million. Loans Total loans and leases, at amortized cost, of $8.54 billion at December 31, 2024 decreased by $36.1 million, or 0.42%, from September 30, 2024. The quarter-over quarter decrease in loans is primarily due to decreases of $111.1 million in commercial real estate loans, $11.3 million in Commercial and Industrial loans, and $9.5 million in agribusiness loans, offset by a seasonal increase of $87 million in dairy & livestock loans. Total loans and leases, at amortized cost, decreased by $368.5 million, or 4.14%, from December 31, 2023. The year-over-year decrease in total loans is primarily due to decreases of $277.1 million in commercial real estate loans, $50.65 million in construction loans, and $44.7 million in commercial and industrial loans. Asset Quality During the fourth quarter of 2024, we experienced credit charge-offs of $64,000 and total recoveries of $244,000, resulting in net recoveries of $180,000. The allowance for credit losses (\u201cACL\u201d) totaled $80.1 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $82.9 million at September 30, 2024 and $86.8 million at December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2024, ACL as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 0.94%. This compares to 0.97% at September 30, 2024 and 0.98% at December 31, 2023. Nonperforming loans, defined as nonaccrual loans, including modified loans on nonaccrual, plus loans 90 days past due and accruing interest, and nonperforming assets, defined as nonperforming plus OREO, are highlighted below.

Of the $30.7 million in past due and accruing loans as of September 30, 2024, $24.8 million became classified as nonperforming loans and approximately $1 million became OREO by the end of 2024. The remaining $4.9 million of past due and accruing loans at the end of the third quarter were paid off by the borrower or from the sale of loan collateral. An additional $17.7 million of loans that were classified as nonperforming at the end of the third quarter of 2024 were foreclosed during the fourth quarter and recorded as OREO at December 31, 2024. Classified loans are loans that are graded \u201csubstandard\u201d or worse. Classified loans totaled $89.55 million or 1.05% of total loans at December 31, 2024 compared with $124.61 million or 1.44 % of loans at September 30, 2024 and $102.20 million or 1.15 % of total loans at December 31, 2023. The quarter-over-quarter decrease of $35.06 million is primarily due to a $26.72 million net decrease in classified nonowner occupied commercial real estate loans and a $10.82 million net decrease in dairy & livestock and agribusiness loans. Deposits & Customer Repurchase Agreements Deposits of $11.9 billion and customer repurchase agreements of $261.9 million totaled $12.21 billion at December 31, 2024. This represented a net decrease of $256.7 million compared to September 30, 2024. Total deposits and customer repurchase agreements increased $505.0 million, or 4.31%, when compared to $11.71 billion at December 31, 2023, partially due to the growth in brokered deposits, which totaled $300 million at December 31, 2024. Overall, non-maturity deposits grew by $314.7 million, or 2.80%, from the end of 2023. Noninterest-bearing deposits were $7.04 billion at December 31, 2024, a decrease of $100.0 million, or 1.40%, when compared to $7.14 billion at September 30, 2024. Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased by $169.1 million, or 2.35%, when compared to $7.21 billion at December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2024, noninterest-bearing deposits were 58.90% of total deposits, compared to 59.12% at September 30, 2024 and 63.03% at December 31, 2023.

The FHLB advances include maturities of $300 million, at an average cost of approximately 4.73%, maturing in May of 2026, and $200 million, at a cost of 4.27% maturing in May of 2027. Total borrowings decreased by $1.57 billion from the end of 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, we repaid the $1.3 billion of borrowings from the Federal Reserve\u2019s Bank Term Funding Program, with a cost of 4.76%, that were scheduled to mature in January of 2025. Capital The Company\u2019s total equity was $2.19 billion at December 31, 2024. This represented an overall increase of $108.34 million from total equity of $2.08 billion at December 31, 2023.

David Brager Thank you, Allen. Good morning, everyone. First, I want to say that our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and those impacted by the devastating wildfires that occurred in Los Angeles County. Citizens Business Bank organized a response around 4 key issues: our associates, our customers, our facilities and our corporate response for our communities. First, we had over 50 associates that were impacted by the mandatory evacuation orders, and we will be providing direct support to them through a variety of methods. Second, we have identified 114 loans totaling approximately $105 million located in the fire zones. At this point, 14 properties have experienced some level of damage with 7 of the properties completely destroyed, 1 commercial building and 6 residential properties totaling $7.4 million. All 14 of the impacted properties had insurance in place and we have actually received proceeds to fully pay off one of the residential properties. Third, due to the mandatory evacuation orders or power outages, we had 6 centers temporarily closed at some point during the fires and all the locations have now reopened. Fourth, we announced that we have donated $200,000 to 4 relief agencies working on the front lines to assist people in need and will be one of the banks participating in the California DFPI relief efforts to assist those impacted. Now to the quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2024, we reported net earnings of $51 million or $0.36 per share, representing our 191st consecutive quarter of profitability. We previously declared a $0.20 per share dividend for the fourth quarter of 2024 representing our 141st consecutive quarter of paying a cash dividend to our shareholders. We produced a return on average tangible common equity of 14.3% and a return on average assets of 1.3% for the fourth quarter of 2024. Our return on equity is impacted by our high level of capital which is reflected in our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 16.2% and 9.8% tangible common equity ratio. In conjunction with our company's capital planning, we announced in November of 2024 that our Board of Directors authorized a new $10 million share repurchase program. Our net earnings of $51 million or $0.36 per share compared with $51 million for the third quarter of 2024 or $0.37 per share and $48.5 million or $0.35 per share for the prior year quarter. Pretax income in the fourth quarter of $68 million was $423,000 higher than the third quarter of 2024. Net interest income decreased quarter-over-quarter by $3.2 million or 2.8%, primarily due to the actions we have taken to deleverage our balance sheet by reducing borrowings and other wholesale funds, therefore, reducing our earning assets. Noninterest income increased by $269,000 and noninterest expense decreased by $355,000 compared to the third quarter. We had a recapture of allowance for credit losses of $3 million in the fourth quarter. On September 26, 2024, we completed an early redemption of our $1.3 billion bank term funding program borrowing that was scheduled to mature in January of 2025. By redeeming this debt, we deleveraged our balance sheet, resulting in total average assets for the fourth quarter declining by almost $1 billion from the third quarter. The reduction in debt reduced interest expense by $15 million per quarter, driving a 13 basis point increase in our net interest margin for the fourth quarter. We were able to increase our return on average assets from 1.24% in the third quarter to 1.3% in the fourth quarter. We executed 2 sale-leaseback transactions in the fourth quarter of 2024 and in which we sold and leased back 2 buildings under long-term leases, realizing gains on sale totaling $16.8 million. In conjunction with these real estate transactions, we sold $155 million of available-for-sale investment securities at a cumulative loss of $16.7 million. At December 31, 2024, our total deposits and customer repurchase agreements totaled $12.2 billion, a $505 million increase from December 31, 2023, including the growth of $315 million of nonmaturity deposits. Although we generally experienced a decrease in deposits at the end of the fourth quarter each year, total deposits and customer repos grew on average by $150 million over the third quarter of 2024. Compared to the third quarter, non-maturity deposits grew on average by $188 million while time deposits declined on average by $130 million, inclusive of a $100 million brokered CD that we did not renew. By the end of the fourth quarter, we experienced a decrease in deposits and customer repos from the end of the third quarter of $257 million. Noninterest-bearing deposits were 59% of total deposits for the fourth and third quarters of 2024, down from 63% at the end of 2023. We are optimistic about our ability to continue to grow low-cost deposits. 2024 was a relatively strong year for new deposit relationships. As an example, our specialty deposit group generated 75% more in new business in 2025 than the average for the prior 2 years. From December 31, 2019, a to December 31, 2024, our total deposits and repos have grown by more than $3 billion. Excluding the deposits acquired from Suncrest Bank and brokered CDs, our core deposits and repos grew by approximately $1.6 billion, which represents a cumulative average growth rate of 3.3% over that 5-year period. Our cost of deposits was 93 basis points for the fourth quarter of 2024, which compares to 98 basis points for the third quarter of 2024 and 62 basis points for the year ago quarter. Our cost of nonmaturity deposits has grown from 60 basis points in December of 2023 to 81 basis points in December of 2024 while our cost of time deposits has grown from 1.84% in December of 2023 to 2.84% in December of '24. Now let's discuss loans. Total loans at December 31, 2024, were $8.54 billion, a $36 million decrease from the end of the third quarter and a $368 million or 4% decline from December 31, 2023. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was led by a $111 million decline in commercial real estate loans. We also had an $11 million decrease in commercial and industrial loans and approximately $10 million decline in agribusiness loans. Dairy and livestock loans grew seasonally by $87 million from the end of the third quarter. We continue to experience limited demand for commercial real estate loans and rate competition for the quality of loans we focus on has been very competitive. We average yields of 7% on new CRE loans in the fourth quarter, but by the end of the quarter, originations were in the high 6% range. C&I line utilization continues to be low, even though we have grown our total C&I loan commitments. Overall, total new loan commitments for 2024 were 90% of 2023's production but balances funded on the new loan commitments was only 75% of 2023 levels as we originated a greater percentage of C&I loans in 2024. The decrease in loans from the end of 2023 included commercial real estate loans declining by $277 million and construction loans declining by $51 million as construction loan origination was minimal in 2024. C&I loans also declined by $45 million when comparing December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024. In total, we ended the quarter with $19.3 million in OREO assets, including $17.7 million of loans that were classified as nonperforming at the end of the third quarter of 2024 and were foreclosed during the fourth quarter and recorded as an OREO. An additional $1 million loan that was not past due at September 30, 2024 became an OREO asset at year-end. Net recoveries for the fourth quarter were $180,000, which compares to $156,000 in net recoveries for the third quarter of 2024. Total nonperforming and delinquent loans decreased from $53.3 million at September 30, 2024, to $47.6 million at December 31, 2024. We had $3.7 million of past due and accruing loans as of September 30, 2024, of which $24.8 million became nonperforming and approximately $1 million became OREO by the end of 2024. We reversed interest income of approximately $1.5 million during the fourth quarter for these nonperforming assets. The remaining $4.9 million of past due and accruing loans at the end of the third quarter were paid off by the borrower or from the sale of loan collateral. Classified loans were $89.5 million at December 31, 2024, $25 million lower than the prior quarter and $17 million lower than the end of 2023. Classified loans as a percentage of total loans was 1.05% at the end of 2024. Classified dairy and livestock and agribusiness loans declined by $11 million as profitability is improving for these borrowers. Classified nonowner commercial real estate loans decreased by $27 million, including a reduction of $13 million for a group of multifamily loans to 1 borrower which we foreclosed on during the fourth quarter. Of this $13 million in loans, $9 million became OREO as of December 31, while the remaining $4 million was paid off through the sale of the collateral. Additionally, $9.8 million loan on a senior living facility that was a participation entered into by Suncrest Bank was foreclosed during the fourth quarter and recorded as an OREO at December 31, 2024. We do not anticipate losses on the sale of the $19 million of OREO assets during the first quarter of 2025. The multifamily properties representing the $9 million of OREO have been or will be sold in January as sales of these properties have either closed or under sales contracts awaiting title to clear in the next few days. There is also a signed purchase agreement for the senior living facility, which we expect to close in February. I will now turn the call over to Allen to further discuss our net interest income and additional aspects of our balance sheet. Allen? Story Continues E. Allen Nicholson Thanks, Dave. We effected a deleveraging of our balance sheet at the end of the third quarter of 2024 by completing an early redemption of $1.3 billion bank term funding program borrowing in September of last year. As a result of this deleveraging, average borrowings during the fourth quarter of 2024 were $1.2 billion lower than the third quarter of last year. And average earning assets decreased by approximately $975 million from the third quarter. The use of cash to redeem the bank term funding program borrowing at the end of the third quarter resulted in our average funds on deposit at the better reserve decreasing by approximately $750 million during the fourth quarter of 2024. Investment securities also declined on average between the third and fourth quarters of 2024 by $144 million as we executed on targeted sales of certain available-for-sale or AFS securities during the third and fourth quarters of '24. We executed 2 sale-leaseback transactions during the fourth quarter of 2024, realizing gains on sale totaling $16.8 million. In conjunction with these real estate transactions, we sold approximately $155 million of available-for-sale investment securities at a cumulative loss of $16.7 million. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we purchased $385 million of securities, a combination of floating rate and 15-year fixed-rate mortgage-backed securities with an average yield at the time of purchase of more than 5%. We also sold more than $300 million of AFS securities during the third quarter of 2024 at a cumulative loss of $11.6 million, which was also timed in conjunction with the sale and leaseback of 2 banking center buildings during the third quarter. The building sales in the third quarter resulted in gains on sales totaling $9.1 million. The securities sold in the third quarter had an average book yield of less than 3%, while the securities sold in the fourth quarter had an average book yield of less than 2%. On a combined basis, over the third and fourth quarters of 2024, we sold $467 million of the low-yielding AFS securities and purchased $385 million of new investments with current yields in excess of 5%. Available for sale investment securities were approximately $2.54 billion at December 31, 2024, a $77 million increase from September 30, 2024. The unrealized loss on AFS securities increased by $80 million from $367 million at September 30, 2024, to $448 million on December 31, 2024. At the end of the third quarter of 2024, we had 3 paid fixed swaps that we recorded as fair value hedges totaling $1 billion in notional value. The bank received daily sober on these swaps. In December, we unwound one of these swaps, which matured in June 2027 with a notional value of $300 million and a fixed rate of 3.95%. We netted less than $100,000 on the transaction. For the fourth quarter of 2024, we earned a positive carry on these swaps, generating $2.3 million of interest income compared to $4.3 million in the third quarter of 2024. At year-end, we continue to have $300 million of brokered CDs that have been swapped as cash flow hedges. But an additional $100 million brokered CD that was issued earlier in 2024 was not renewed during the fourth quarter. As of December 31, 2024, the market value of our remaining 2 fair value hedges, combined with our cash flow hedges, increased by approximately $27 million from the end of the third quarter. The net after-tax impact of changes in both the fair value of our AFS securities and our derivatives resulted in a $37 million decrease in other comprehensive income for the fourth quarter. Investment securities held to maturity or HTM securities totaled approximately $2.38 billion at December 31, 2024. The HTM portfolio declined by approximately $26 million from September 30. Our total investment portfolio declined by $500 million from December 31, 2023, including a decline in AFS securities of more than $400 million. As of December 31, 2024, we had $800 million in wholesale funds including $500 million of Federal Home Loan Bank advances and $300 million of brokered CDs, which represents a $1.4 billion decrease from our wholesale funds on December 31, 2023. As a result of our balance sheet deleveraging and the Fed lowering short-term interest rates, our interest income in the fourth quarter declined by $18 million over the third quarter of 2024. Average earning assets declined by $974 million and the yield on earning assets declined by 19 basis points. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to an $11 million decline in interest from funds deposited the Federal Reserve, reflecting a $748 million decrease in average balances at the Fed and a 65 basis point decline in the yield on these funds. Loans were also down on average by $83 million, which combined with a 16 basis point decrease in loan yields resulted in a $4.7 million decrease in interest income. This decline in loan interest income included the approximately $1.5 million of accrued interest that was reversed for loans that were classified as nonaccrual during the fourth quarter. A better reflection of the decline in loan yield is the decline in our core loan yields, which decreased by 6 basis points from September to December of 2024. Interest expense decreased by $15 million over the prior quarter due to the $15 million decrease in interest on borrowings, reflecting the redemption of the $1.3 billion in ETF borrowings. Our cost of funds decreased from 1.47% for the third quarter of 2024 to 1.13% in the fourth quarter. After our balance sheet repositioning net interest income before provision for credit losses decreased by $3.2 million from the third to the fourth quarter of 2024, while our net interest margin expanded from 3.05% in the third quarter to 3.18% in the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2024, we recaptured $3 million in provision for credit losses reducing our allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2024, to $80 million. Our ACL at December 31, 2023, was $86.8 million including approximately $6 million of reserves for specifically identified nonperforming loans. Our reserves for specific loans was close to 0 at December 31, 2024. Our economic forecast continues to be a blend of multiple forecasts produced by Moody's. We continue to have the largest individual scenario waiting on Moody's baseline forecast with both upside and downside risk weighted among multiple forecasts. The resulting economic forecast resulted in real GDP growing at a slower rate with GDP growth below 2% for 2025 through 2027. And the unemployment rate rising over 5% by 2026 and not moving below 5% until 2028. Commercial real estate prices are also forecasted to continue their decline in 2025 with only meaningful price appreciation starting in 2027. Now turning to our capital position. At December 31, 2024, our shareholders' equity was $2.2 billion, a $100 million increase from the end of 2023. The company's tangible common equity ratio at December 31, 2024, was 9.8% compared with 8.5% at December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2024, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 16.2% and our total risk-based capital ratio was 17.1%. Although the Board of Directors authorized a new 10b5-1 stock repurchase plan in November, there were no shares repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2024. I'll now turn the call back to Dave for further discussion of our fourth quarter earnings. David Brager Thank you, Allen. Moving on to noninterest income. Our noninterest income was $13.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $12.8 million for the third quarter and $19.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. The third quarter of 2024 included a net loss of $2.3 million between the sale-leaseback transactions and the accompanying bond sales, while the fourth quarter transactions essentially offset. Only income decreased by $1.1 million from the third quarter and by $5.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. These decreases were primarily the result of the BOLI restructuring during the fourth quarter of 2023. Income from CRA-related investments was approximately $1 million lower in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to both the third quarter of '24 and the fourth quarter of 2023. Our trust and wealth management fees increased by approximately $370,000 or more than 14% and compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Now expenses. Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter was $58.5 million compared with $58.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 and $65.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The fourth quarter of 2023 included $9.2 million of additional expense related to the initial FDIC special assessment. A recapture provision for unfunded loan commitments totaled $750,000 in the third quarter of 2024 and $500,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023. Staff-related expenses declined by approximately $650,000 from the third quarter of 2024, while increasing by approximately $350,000 from the fourth quarter of 2023. Occupancy expense grew by $167,000 when compared with the fourth quarter of 2023, which includes the impact of the higher occupancy costs for the 4 offices involved in the sale-leaseback transactions. Excluding a decrease in building security expense, occupancy expense would have increased by approximately $400,000 from the fourth quarter of 2023 and would have been essentially the same in comparison to the third quarter of 2024. Noninterest expense totaled 1.49% of average assets for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to 1.42% for the prior quarter and 1.62% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Our efficiency ratio was 46.3% for the fourth quarter of 2024. This compares with 46.5% for the third quarter and 47.6% in the year ago quarter. This concludes today's presentation. Now Allen and I will be happy to take any questions that you might have. Question and Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions) David Feaster, Raymond James. David Feaster I just wanted to start out maybe touching on the pulse of your clients. There's a lot of optimism out there with investors and analysts alike talking about improving demand, accelerating loan growth. I'm curious, have you started to see that in your pipeline yet? Just kind of the early read with your conversations and how clients, just their sense of optimism in their plans for 2025? David Brager Yes, I absolutely believe there's a sense of optimism going forward. And we have had a good start to the year on the loan front. The pipelines are improving but are still not where I would want them to be overall. But just generally speaking, I don't think there's any question that people are a little more excited and looking forward to 2025. So I do believe that we'll be able to execute on loan growth, and it's something that all of our bankers understand, our user reach now to our customers talking about plans that they maybe had shelved before that they are now hoping to get done or get started. So absolutely believe there's some enthusiasm out there, which we haven't had in a couple of years. David Feaster Okay. That's great. And then just wanted to touch on your capital priorities. You guys have been active, very active. You've got an extremely strong balance sheet. How do you think about deploying capital today? And where are you most interested? Are buybacks or additional restructurings on the table? And just any broader thoughts maybe on the M&A market as well? David Brager Yes. So I mean, obviously, we recognize we have an enormous amount of capital. And we have a number of things that we want to accomplish, First and foremost, we want to be able to grow -- utilize the capital to grow internally. As far as the M&A market is concerned, conversations have definitely picked up. We've had numerous conversations over the last month or so with a number of banks, and we'll continue to do that. The challenge really has been most of the people on the other side, look at this and say, well, here's what Citizens Business Bank can pay based on where they're trading, and then we have to explain to them how much we are willing to pay, and there's usually a disconnect between those 2 numbers. And so it is an important part of 2025 for us. I do believe we're in a window from a regulatory perspective, from a business environment perspective, I think that we should be able to execute on something in 2025. But at this point, obviously, nothing imminent, nothing happening, but we are working very hard at that. And then beyond the M&A, but beyond the growth in the M&A front, we do have the 10b5-1 plan in place we are disciplined, and it is somewhat opportunistic from where we're trading or at least where we were trading yesterday. And so there will be an opportunity, I believe, for us to continue to look at that if it hits the certain numbers. So we're working on that. So I don't know, Allen, if you have anything you want to add, but -- E. Allen Nicholson The only other thing I would say, David, is from an M&A perspective, certainly, sellers' expectation may be have gotten a little too optimistic, but also rate has moved up as you can reflect in the impact to our OCI and that does continue to make the math a little more challenging when you do acquisitions. So those are -- other than the regulatory being positive, those are maybe some headwinds to it. And just remember, as we said last quarter, we have enough capital to do M&A and buybacks. So they're not exclusive of each other. David Brager Yes. And just 1 more thing, David, just to sort of tie the bow on this. It's not burning a hole in our pocket either from the sense of, I think there was a big bank CEO who said the capital is not running a hole in our pocket. We're going to be disciplined in how we look at the uses of capital, whether that's through M&A, buybacks, other ways, we will continue to perform at a very high level, and we are going to generate additional capital but we definitely want to put it to use, but we also want to make sure we put it to use in our normal disciplined way. David Feaster Yes. That's great. And then just -- you guys have done a great job you've been really active managing interest-bearing deposit costs. I'm curious, the feedback that you've received from clients, have you gotten any pushback? Have you seen any attrition? And then just how do you think about your ability to further reduce deposit costs and your outlook for core deposit growth going forward? David Brager Yes. We added a slide in our slide deck that showed from -- and I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that we've grown deposits by 3.3% on a 5-year cumulative average growth rate. It's actually 6% if you include the acquisition and the brokered deposits that we've added. But I feel very confident on that front. I mean we have done a great job in the last couple of years when commercial real estate last year really, but a couple of years for the most part, where commercial real estate demand has been slower. We have brought on a number of great operating companies, C&I relationships. Well, that doesn't really translate into loan growth because the utilization is low and -- but it does translate in a lot of other ways. And so if there is this optimism that I am feeling out there in the market. I think that some of these customers will start to utilize those lines, we'll start to initiate projects that maybe they were holding off on. And deposits should grow just as that money starts moving around. And we're continuing to drive growth in our Specialty Banking group and our government services group. So all of those sort of focused verticals that we have there are areas for us to do a good job. And a lot of the excess money is out of the system. As we've talked about in the past, over $1 billion has gone to our trust group. There's an opportunity depending on what rates do, that some of that could start to come back if they're going to start on some of these other projects. So I'm very optimistic on the deposit side. We constantly have to prove our worth there. And we've done a really good job. We will continue to do a good job there. Operator Andrew Terrell, Stephens. Andrew Terrell I just wanted to maybe start on the margin. If I look in the presentation, it looks like the cost of total deposits was 90 basis points in December, so a few basis points off of the quarterly average. I'm just curious, any color you can provide on just the timing of rate reductions that you took kind of throughout the quarter? And then as we look into 2025, should we think of -- obviously, that 90 basis points is kind of the starting point coming into the year. But do you feel like there's more reductions cost-wise, you can make in the deposit base absent any additional rate decreases? E. Allen Nicholson So Andrew, if you look at that slide, I think you're mentioning, if you look at the top left, where you separate the cost of nonmaturity versus time deposits. From a time deposit perspective, the bulk of what we have in time deposits is those cash flow hedge CDs. So those are unlikely near term to change. That said, the nonmaturity deposits will probably continue to slowly go down in the near term. The Fed does nothing, then obviously, it hit a floor. But I think over the next month or 2, we probably will still see a little bit of a lag because the last Fed cut was in December. So there's still probably a little bit of a decline for that to continue. And then we suspect that, that won't be doing anything this year and that will probably level out. David Brager And Andrew, just to add 1 comment on that, a little more technical. Basically, every money market rate in the bank that was 1% or over in the last rate cut, we matched that recut 100% on that. So to Allen's point, some of that occurred later in the month of December, and you're not seeing it in the monthly average, but there still should be some opportunity there. And look, it's also a big part of the mix, right? If we can continue to get operating deposits and move our noninterest-bearing deposits, keep them the same or move them up a little bit as a percent of total deposits, that should help, too, in the overall cost. Andrew Terrell Got it. I appreciate it. And then for the $500 million of borrowings that are remaining, can you remind us the weighted average cost of those? E. Allen Nicholson I think it's in the low 4s, if I remember correctly, Andrew, I'll estimate like 4 25, if I recall correctly. Andrew Terrell Okay. And then just last 1 for me. I mean, the expenses were pretty stable quarter-to-quarter. I would love to hear just your thoughts on -- it sounds like optimistic on loan growth in 2025. How are you thinking about expense growth in 2025? And what are some of the kind of key areas of investment you're focused on in the year? E. Allen Nicholson Andrew, I would say that from a controllable expense perspective. We've probably been growing about 4% recently. I think our goal is to keep it below that going forward but we do plan on continuing to invest in technology. At the same time, I think some of those investments we have and will be made will help deploy and increase our efficiency. So -- but the area of focus will continue to be. There's no big bang per se of any 1 major technology. It's just a number of things we're doing to automate and improve overall efficiencies. Operator Ahmad Hasan, D.A. Davidson. Ahmad Hasan Ahmad Hasan on for Gary Tenner. Any additional color on the timing of the $35 million in securities purchases? E. Allen Nicholson Timing of the purchases we did in the fourth quarter? Ahmad Hasan Yes. E. Allen Nicholson The purchase that we did in the fourth quarter based on settlement dates, it was probably weighted more towards the end of the quarter versus the middle of the quarter, I guess, is the best way of explaining it to you. Ahmad Hasan Right. That makes sense. And as a follow-up, any additional sale leaseback or securities transaction contemplated at this point? David Brager No. We originally had actually looked at selling 6 properties. Our timing was pretty good on this and both from a sales perspective is onto the properties and the sale perspective of the securities. We actually sold all of the properties under a 6 cap and a couple of the properties under a 5 cap. And so once we got to the 4 properties, we decided to not sell the other 2 properties to increase our expenses. So at this point, there are no contemplated sale-leaseback transactions and we don't have anything listed for sale. So I think our mini balance sheet restructuring for the most part is done. Operator Adam Butler, Piper Sandler. Adam Butler This is Adam on for Matthew Clark. So just on the expense line, particularly occupancy and equipment expense, what was the timing of the sale-leaseback transaction? And how much of that 4Q run rate of $5.9 million includes the expected $1.8 million annualized increase in the expense line? E. Allen Nicholson Those sales occurred in October. So the bulk of it was reflected. There's other things that go into our occupancy expense. So you can look at our slide deck, and you'll be able to see the full year annual impact to occupancy from the sale leaseback but we have other ways to reduce expense as well. I mean, as we -- as leases come up, we are reducing what we're paying on those leases and downsizing the size of our offices. So there's other components that we're managing to keep occupancy expense down. Adam Butler Okay. That's helpful. And then on the buyback authorization. I was just curious to get your sense of optimism on your -- on being opportunistic on repurchases if rates remain elevated. E. Allen Nicholson Well, I think as Dave said, that buyback, we have a 10b5-1 in place. And we typically do make those opportunistic. So we'll see. There's always -- I mean 2025 may be a volatile stock market. And so we buy on the dips, really, and that's the way it's designed. Operator (Operator Instructions) Kelly Motta, KBW. Kelly Motta I guess from a high level, we sometimes get pushed back from investors on the dynamics in California with population outflows migration and it's a terrible situation, but the wildfire certainly doesn't help the narrative. What would you say to those who question the outlook here in California? What are you seeing and what gives you optimism about your outlook ahead here? David Brager Yes. So many of those thoughts, sometimes Allen and I share as well. So that's okay. But what I would say, and this is true, look, California is the, whatever, fifth, sixth, seventh largest economy in the world. It's an extremely diversified economy across pretty much every industry whereas many other states are more one-trick ponies in a lot of cases. When you look at our market share in the markets we serve, we have a lot of opportunity to acquire market share. We're not a 30% or 40% market share in the State of California. We're a 2% or 3% market share in the state of California. So I think there's a lot of opportunity there. And despite the fact that there's been out migration, if somebody's business is here, it is very easy for them to pick up and move to another state, but it's very hard for them to move their business out of state. And while we will follow their business out of state, if they go like we've done in dairy and livestock like we've done in some other situations. Most of the time, it's more of a personal decision and where they're making their money is still in California. And so I think there -- to the point of California's challenges, I think all that's true but it's still a great opportunity for us, and we still have a lot of opportunity in the type of client that we want to attract to our bank. So I don't -- I'm not as negative on the overall situation. I mean there are individual situations, sometimes they create problems. But for the most part, even when our customers have moved, 99% of the time, we still bank them. So they're not going anywhere from a business perspective. Kelly Motta Got it. That's really helpful. And then I also wanted to touch on just the opportunity on the loan side. I think I caught in your prepared remarks or earlier in the Q&A that commercial real estate has been -- it's challenging right now to get things that missed fit your very tight credit box. Can you remind us where are new loans coming on at? And do you -- if we were to get a rate cut or 2, do you think you can help offset that with reinvestment of some of these cash flows into the loan production you're getting? David Brager Yes. So look, like I said, sort of in my earlier answer, I think people are optimistic, and I do think the pipelines are improving, albeit not where we want them to be completely. I do think that there's more commercial real estate that people are now willing maybe to do some stuff. The movement in the 10-year -- the 5-year and the 10-year, which is primarily what we base our rates on as move rates higher spreads have come in, we've had to be more aggressive on the pricing if it meets our credit box. We won't substitute or take any credit -- any more credit risk than we would normally take, but we are having to be more aggressive on the pricing. And as I said in my prepared remarks, I would say it's coming in at the 6.5% range and maybe slightly higher than that. So we're having to do stuff. We just launched the deal yesterday and it was a 10-year fixed at 4.8 to a large bank. So that's not even the -- I mean, the 10-year treasury is 4.50 or whatever it's at. So I don't -- I mean I think a lot of the challenge -- obviously, we didn't compete at that rate. But a lot of the challenge has been everybody says they're going to grow loans 10%. And the only way to do -- there's only 2 ways to do that: jeopardize your credit quality or price to win. And we're going to be smart about how we do that just as we've been in the history of our bank. But there is some irrational pricing that's starting to happen. And so we just have to make sure -- as Allen reminds me often, we can get mortgage-backed securities and other investments over 5%. So I don't -- with 0 credit risk and a 0 risk rating. So why are we -- No bonus pay (inaudible) David Brager Yes. So we just need to be smart about how we do that. But the simple answer to your question is around 6.5 to 6. 75 is probably the range, I would say, new things are coming on. Operator Tim Coffey, Janney Montgomery Scott. Timothy Coffey Dave, I mean I hate to ask these questions because, I mean, there's still an active situation, but I mean there's going to be -- the fire situation in your footprint, there's going to be some things that are going to happen with your balance sheet over the next couple of quarters. And so I'm wondering, is the expectation that the money you bring -- that comes into the bank in form of deposits from rebuilding from insurance? Your expectation to put those into kind of overnight funds? David Brager Yes. By the way, it's no problem asking the questions. I mean, Tim, we have a very limited impact, I would say, directly. As I mentioned, we only have 14 impacted properties, 7 of those 14 were completely destroyed. One of the 7, we've already received the insurance proceeds and paid off the loan. And he has the money sitting in the bank. So currently, that money is sitting in a band control in an account that we control, bank control account that we will use to -- once you find somebody and once he can start rebuilding to rebuild his home. So I don't think the impact is that great. I mean, it's about $7.5 million of loans that are on properties that are destroyed. And so I think the appraised value is somewhere in the neighborhood of $23 million, $24 million. We'll probably get somewhere close to $20 million in insurance proceeds. So I don't think it's going to have a big impact either way. One of the things -- and again, not something that you want to have to do. But we have agreed to be part of a couple of different efforts to rebuild, 1 through the Department of Financial Protection and innovation. We decided to give relief if anybody asks -- nobody has asked for a relief at this point. But there are some measures that they asked us to agree to, which we did. There's also a group of banks that's being put together led by a supervisor in L.A. County that wants to work with a bunch of community banks to help these impacted people rebuild. And so that -- I don't know too much about that yet. Our first meeting is tomorrow on that. So I'll know more after tomorrow. But I don't think it's going to be a huge impact. We have a decent amount of contractors as customers. And they're all going to be busy and for a long time on this. And so I think that maybe should help us a little bit on the deposit side and potentially even the borrowing side. So I think all in all, while it was obviously a terrible situation, I think from a business perspective for the bank, I see probably more upside opportunity than downside risk. At least at this point. Timothy Coffey Right. And then that's my next question, it's on the loan side, right? Because I think there is going to be some opportunity for new development, I won't say, in the fire and maybe perhaps not for the existing property owner. And that would put contractors to work quite a bit. Do you feel -- I mean that you're -- obviously, you're capable and willing to rebuild the community. I mean are you comfortable with construction balances rising above the current level for a period of time? David Brager We are. We have -- as you know, we have such a low balance there. I mean we have a lot of capacity there. And I have actually even -- we are extremely disciplined on the construction side. Like 50%, 60% loan to cost is generally what we do. I've actually even talked to our Chief Credit Officer about maybe relaxing that a little bit where we are doing something from a wildfire relief perspective, still has to meet all the other credit aspects of it, but allowing maybe a 60% or 70% loan to cost. So relaxing a little bit while still maintaining excellent credit quality. I don't see that number going from where it is today and going to $300 million, but it could get to $100 million or $150 million over the next couple of years. And Tim, I just want to say thank you regarding the donations as well. I appreciate your comments in the e-mail you said me. Timothy Coffey Well, yes, of course, I mean, I'm in Northern California. So I've seen how devastating the wildfires can be to my community. So absolutely, I'll be of help. Operator I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. David Brager for any closing remarks. David Brager Thank you, Shuri.

{"text": "Bullish CVB Financial Insiders Loaded Up On US$1.71m Of Stock editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Wed, Jan 8, 2025, 1:41 PM 3 min read In This Article: CVBF -2.35% Multiple insiders secured a larger position in CVB Financial Corp. ( NASDAQ:CVBF ) shares over the last 12 months. This is reassuring as this suggests that insiders have increased optimism about the company's prospects. While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for CVB Financial The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At CVB Financial In the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Independent Vice Chairman of the Board George Borba bought US$1m worth of shares at a price of US$16.78 per share. Even though the purchase was made at a significantly lower price than the recent price (US$20.81), we still think insider buying is a positive. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices. Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$1.7m for 103.51k shares. But insiders sold 11.25k shares worth US$248k. Overall, CVB Financial insiders were net buyers during the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date! NasdaqGS:CVBF Insider Trading Volume January 8th 2025 There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of undervalued small cap companies that insiders are buying. CVB Financial Insiders Are Selling The Stock The last three months saw significant insider selling at CVB Financial. In total, Independent Director Stephen Del Guercio sold US$197k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all. Insider Ownership Of CVB Financial Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that CVB Financial insiders own 6.1% of the company, worth about US$180m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders. So What Does This Data Suggest About CVB Financial Insiders? An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. On the other hand, the insider transactions over the last year are encouraging. And insider ownership remains quite considerable. So the recent selling doesn't worry us. If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future .

Why It's a 'Buy' Now Zacks Equity Research Thu, Jan 2, 2025, 5:55 PM 3 min read In This Article: CVBF -2.35% A downtrend has been apparent in CVB Financial (CVBF) lately. While the stock has lost 9% over the past four weeks, it could witness a trend reversal as a hammer chart pattern was formed in its last trading session. This could mean that the bulls have been able to counteract the bears to help the stock find support. While the formation of a hammer pattern is a technical indication of nearing a bottom with potential exhaustion of selling pressure, rising optimism among Wall Street analysts about the future earnings of this bank holding company is a solid fundamental factor that enhances the prospects of a trend reversal for the stock. 1-month candlestick chart for CVBF Understanding Hammer Chart and the Technique to Trade It This is one of the popular price patterns in candlestick charting. A minor difference between the opening and closing prices forms a small candle body, and a higher difference between the low of the day and the open or close forms a long lower wick (or vertical line). The length of the lower wick being at least twice the length of the real body, the candle resembles a 'hammer.' In simple terms, during a downtrend, with bears having absolute control, a stock usually opens lower compared to the previous day's close, and again closes lower. On the day the hammer pattern is formed, maintaining the downtrend, the stock makes a new low. However, after eventually finding support at the low of the day, some amount of buying interest emerges, pushing the stock up to close the session near or slightly above its opening price. When it occurs at the bottom of a downtrend, this pattern signals that the bears might have lost control over the price. And, the success of bulls in stopping the price from falling further indicates a potential trend reversal. Hammer candles can occur on any timeframe -- such as one-minute, daily, weekly -- and are utilized by both short-term as well as long-term investors. Like every technical indicator, the hammer chart pattern has its limitations. Particularly, as the strength of a hammer depends on its placement on the chart, it should always be used in conjunction with other bullish indicators. Here's What Makes the Trend Reversal More Likely for CVBF An upward trend in earnings estimate revisions that CVBF has been witnessing lately can certainly be considered a bullish indicator on the fundamental side. That's because empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements. The consensus EPS estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the last 30 days. This means that the Wall Street analysts covering CVBF are majorly in agreement about the company's potential to report better earnings than what they predicted earlier. Story Continues If this is not enough, you should note that CVBF currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. And stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 usually outperform the market.
