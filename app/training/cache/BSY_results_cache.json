[{"text": "Meet the Supercharged Growth Stock That Could Make You a Millionaire Lee Samaha, The Motley Fool Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 12:32 PM 5 min read In This Article: BSY -1.48% Bentley Systems (NASDAQ: BSY) is a growth stock with a big future. The infrastructure-engineering software company is a leader in its industry and offers investors a unique combination of exposure to infrastructure spending (a bipartisan-supported activity) and the exciting megatrend of digitizing engineering processes. This combination is reflected in a company whose technology demonstrably saves public sector money. Introducing Bentley Systems Founded by the remarkable Bentley brothers (five of whom had senior involvement at the company and four of whom still sit on the board today), the company is a leading player in a niche market. To quickly understand what Bentley's software solutions do, it's a good idea to consider how traditional infrastructure projects were carried out. In the pre-digital age, incredibly complex infrastructure projects were designed and developed by many engineers, contractors, and project managers, all of whom held a considerable amount of disparate data (usually in paper form) in their hands. As such, it's not hard to immediately see the potential for significant cost overruns and waste (things the infrastructure industry is notorious for) in this context. Moreover, large infrastructure projects may occur only once or twice in an engineer's lifetime. Unlike the continuous, iteratively refined manufacturing process, such as in a bottling plant or in the manufacture of machine parts, infrastructure engineers don't have much experience in doing precisely the same project repeatedly. That's where Bentley Systems comes in. Its infrastructure-engineering software enables users to create digital 3D designs and documentation for major projects, including bridges, buildings, cities, processing plants, roads, renewable energy projects, and rail systems. As such, the mass of data is stored digitally and is easily accessible by multiple users, enabling better management and monitoring of infrastructure projects along with cost reduction, waste minimization, and better maintenance of projects.

A digital twin is simply a digital model of a physical asset. The model can simulate to better predict the behavior and progress of the physical asset through its design phase to construction, use, and maintenance. By storing the data centrally and constantly monitoring it with the involvement of multiple users, infrastructure projects can be better managed, completed, and maintained. Story Continues Bentley's numbers add up The strength of its software lineup and the growing adoption of digital technology in infrastructure are clear in its financial metrics. For example, Bentley continues to grow its annualized recurring revenue, or ARR (a key metric in the software industry that includes the annualized value of contracts producing revenue) continues to grow at a low-teens rate. That's impressive enough and indicates a strong growth path ahead. Moreover, not only is Bentley good at growing ARR, but it is also good at retaining and growing revenue from its existing customers. For example, its 12-month recurring net retention rate has been above 100% for at least six years. Image source: Getty Images. In plain English, this rate measures recurring revenue growth from existing accounts. In addition, its account retention rate (measuring revenue from existing accounts rather than recurring revenue) has been near 100% over the same period. Consequently, Bentley has high visibility in its future ARR and revenue generation. Bentley Systems valuation As ever with growth stocks with a high amount of earnings visibility, the valuation on the stock won't be superficially cheap. Trading on 43 times expected 2024 earnings, Bentley Systems certainly fits that description. However, with ARR and revenue growing at a low-teens rate and earnings and free cash flow growing at a mid-teens rate, Bentley will likely grow into its valuation. This is driven by ongoing infrastructure investment and the benefits of digitizing infrastructural projects. Will it make you a millionaire? Let's put it this way: A price to free-crash-flow (FCF) multiple of 33 is fair for a long-term growth stock, and based on Wall Street analyst estimates, that's what Bentley will trade on at the end of 2025 based on the current price. If it can grow cash flow at a 15% rate for the next decade and then a 10% rate for the decade after that, and the share price grows in line with earnings, then $100 thousand invested in it now will be worth $1.05 million over the next two decades. While that's out of range for most investors, the return is indicative of a potentially good investment.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our 9 Best Market-Beating Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

(Image of James Lee, 2023, courtesy of Bentley Systems) Also consolidating product development and technology strategy under Chief Technology Officer Julien Moutte EXTON, Pa., January 13, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Bentley Systems, Incorporated (Nasdaq: BSY), the infrastructure engineering software company, today announced the appointment of James Lee as Chief Operating Officer. Lee joins Bentley from Google, where he served as General Manager for startups and artificial intelligence at Google Cloud. Prior to joining Google in 2020, Lee spent 12 years at SAP, including as Chief Operating Officer for SAP Ariba and Fieldglass, and as Chief Operating Officer and General Manager of Sales for SAP Greater China. He holds a Master of Business Administration degree from Harvard University and a Bachelor of Commerce degree from the University of British Columbia, and is based in the Pacific Northwest. Lee will strengthen Bentley\u2019s cross-functional alignment across planning and execution, will drive operational excellence, and will oversee China, Japan, and portfolio development including growth initiatives such as Bentley Asset Analytics. Nicholas Cumins said, \"I am excited to welcome James, a world-class operational leader, to Bentley. His energy and experience managing operations and investment initiatives at SAP and Google will be instrumental to Bentley as we continue to scale up and drive our ambitious growth agenda.\" To accelerate innovation and better align product execution with technology strategy, Bentley also announced that the responsibility for product development has been consolidated under Chief Technology Officer Julien Moutte. As a result, the Chief Product Officer role has become redundant, and by mutual agreement Mike Campbell will leave the company. \"I would like to thank Mike for his leadership and many accomplishments as Chief Product Officer during the last two years, and wish him much success in his future endeavors,\" Cumins added. \"Streamlining our organizational reporting structure and consolidating product development under Julien puts us in a stronger position to capture the many growth opportunities that we have opened up with infrastructure AI and that are incremental to our core business and consistent momentum. Without a doubt, AI is our generation\u2019s paradigm shift and has huge potential for improving infrastructure delivery and performance.\" Reporting to Cumins, alongside Lee and Moutte, are Chief Revenue Officer Brock Ballard, corporate functions including Marketing, Finance, Legal, and Colleague Success, as well as Seequent, Bentley\u2019s subsurface company.

Bentley Systems, Incorporated (NASDAQ:BSY) A Top Quality Stock? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Thu, Jan 9, 2025, 5:24 PM 3 min read In This Article: BSY -1.48% Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine Bentley Systems, Incorporated ( NASDAQ:BSY ), by way of a worked example. ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Bentley Systems How Is ROE Calculated? The formula for ROE is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Bentley Systems is: 35% = US$364m \u00f7 US$1.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024). The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.35. Does Bentley Systems Have A Good Return On Equity? Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Bentley Systems has a better ROE than the average (12%) in the Software industry . NasdaqGS:BSY Return on Equity January 9th 2025 That's clearly a positive. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk. How Does Debt Impact ROE? Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking. Combining Bentley Systems' Debt And Its 35% Return On Equity It's worth noting the high use of debt by Bentley Systems, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.37. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it. Story Continues Conclusion Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better. But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

Stay Cautious Petr Hu\u0159\u0165\u00e1k Wed, Dec 25, 2024, 12:07 PM 3 \u5206\u9418\u95b1\u8b80\u6642\u9593 \u5728\u9019\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\u4e2d: BSY -1.48% Two Reasons to Watch BSY and One to Stay Cautious Over the past six months, Bentley\u2019s shares (currently trading at $47.62) have posted a disappointing 5.3% loss, well below the S&P 500\u2019s 10.4% gain. This was partly driven by its softer quarterly results and might have investors contemplating their next move. Following the drawdown, is now an opportune time to buy BSY? Find out in our full research report, it\u2019s free . Why Does Bentley Spark Debate? Founded by brothers Keith and Barry Bentley, Bentley Systems (NASDAQ:BSY) offers a software-as-a-service platform that addresses the lifecycle of infrastructure projects such as road networks, tunnel systems, and wastewater facilities. Two Things to Like: 1. Strong Retention Supports Growth and Profitability One of the best parts about the software-as-a-service business model (and a reason why they trade at high valuation multiples) is that customers typically spend more on a company\u2019s products and services over time. Bentley\u2019s net revenue retention rate, a key performance metric measuring how much money existing customers from a year ago are spending today, was 109% in Q3. This means Bentley would\u2019ve grown its revenue by 8.5% even if it didn\u2019t win any new customers over the last 12 months. Bentley Net Revenue Retention Rate Bentley has a decent net retention rate, showing us that its customers not only tend to stick around but also get increasing value from its software over time. 2. Operating Margin Reveals a Well-Run Organization Many software businesses adjust their profits for stock-based compensation (SBC), but we prioritize GAAP operating margin because SBC is a real expense used to attract and retain engineering and sales talent. This is one of the best measures of profitability because it shows how much money a company takes home after developing, marketing, and selling its products. Bentley has been a well-oiled machine over the last year. It demonstrated elite profitability for a software business, boasting an average operating margin of 21.2%. This result isn\u2019t surprising as its high gross margin gives it a favorable starting point. Bentley Operating Margin (GAAP) One Reason to be Careful: Weak Billings Point to Soft Demand Billings is a non-GAAP metric that is often called \u201ccash revenue\u201d because it shows how much money the company has collected from customers in a certain period. This is different from revenue, which must be recognized in pieces over the length of a contract. Bentley\u2019s billings came in at $324.4 million in Q3, and over the last four quarters, its year-on-year growth averaged 8.2%. This performance was underwhelming and suggests that increasing competition is causing challenges in acquiring/retaining customers. \u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80 Bentley Billings Final Judgment Bentley has huge potential even though it has some open questions. After the recent drawdown, the stock trades at 10.9\u00d7 forward price-to-sales (or $47.62 per share). Is now a good time to buy? See for yourself in our in-depth research report, it\u2019s free .

Software Stocks Kayode Omotosho Tue, Dec 10, 2024, 1:05 PM 5 min read In This Article: BSY -1.48% ALRM +1.01% MANH -3.98% Q3 Earnings Highs And Lows: Bentley (NASDAQ:BSY) Vs The Rest Of The Vertical Software Stocks The end of the earnings season is always a good time to take a step back and see who shined (and who not so much). Let\u2019s take a look at how vertical software stocks fared in Q3, starting with Bentley (NASDAQ:BSY). Software is eating the world, and while a large number of solutions such as project management or video conferencing software can be useful to a wide array of industries, some have very specific needs. As a result, vertical software, which addresses industry-specific workflows, is growing and fueled by the pressures to improve productivity, whether it be for a life sciences, education, or banking company. The 4 vertical software stocks we track reported a strong Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 1.8% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 2% above. In light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady. On average, they are relatively unchanged since the latest earnings results. Weakest Q3: Bentley (NASDAQ:BSY) Founded by brothers Keith and Barry Bentley, Bentley Systems (NASDAQ:BSY) offers a software-as-a-service platform that addresses the lifecycle of infrastructure projects such as road networks, tunnel systems, and wastewater facilities. Bentley reported revenues of $335.2 million, up 9.3% year on year. This print fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations by 1.7%. Overall, it was a slower quarter for the company with a slight miss of analysts\u2019 billings estimates and EBITDA in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. CEO Nicholas Cumins said, \u201cDuring my first 100 days as CEO, we unveiled ambitious strategic moves that will help propel our future growth: the acquisition of 3D geospatial company Cesium; a strategic partnership with Google to integrate their geospatial content; a new product portfolio for asset analytics and a new generation of engineering applications, both leveraging AI and digital twin technologies to improve the way infrastructure is designed, built, and operated.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed\u2019s rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has been on a steady path downward, easing back toward that 2% sweet spot. Fortunately (miraculously to some), all this tightening didn\u2019t send the economy tumbling into a recession, so here we are, cautiously celebrating a soft landing. The cherry on top? Recent rate cuts (half a point in September, a quarter in November) have kept 2024 stock markets frothy, especially after Trump\u2019s November win lit a fire under major indices and sent them to all-time highs. However, there's still plenty to ponder \u2014 tariffs, corporate tax cuts, and what 2025 might hold for the economy. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals?

Zacks Equity Research Tue, Dec 3, 2024, 4:48 PM 2 min read In This Article: BSY -1.48% Investors in Bentley Systems, Incorporated BSY need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Dec 20, 2024 $70.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. What is Implied Volatility? Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy. What do the Analysts Think? Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Bentley Systems shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Bentley Systems is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Internet - Software industry that ranks in the Top 16% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while three have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from earnings of 25 cents per share to 23 cents in that period.

(NASDAQ:BSY) Reports Sales Below Analyst Estimates In Q3 Earnings Infrastructure design software provider Bentley Systems (NASDAQ:BSY) missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q3 CY2024, but sales rose 9.3% year on year to $335.2 million. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.24 per share was also 1.9% below analysts\u2019 consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Bentley? Find out in our full research report . Bentley (BSY) Q3 CY2024 Highlights: Revenue: $335.2 million vs analyst estimates of $341.1 million (1.7% miss) Adjusted EPS: $0.24 vs analyst expectations of $0.24 (1.9% miss) EBITDA: $110 million vs analyst estimates of $110.2 million (small miss) Gross Margin (GAAP): 80.7%, up from 78.9% in the same quarter last year Operating Margin: 20.5%, down from 24% in the same quarter last year EBITDA Margin: 32.8%, down from 35.6% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 25.1%, up from 18% in the previous quarter Annual Recurring Revenue: $1.27 billion at quarter end, up 13% year on year Net Revenue Retention Rate: 109%, up from 108% in the previous quarter Billings: $318.5 million at quarter end, up 11.4% year on year Market Capitalization: $15.84 billion CEO Nicholas Cumins said, \u201cDuring my first 100 days as CEO, we unveiled ambitious strategic moves that will help propel our future growth: the acquisition of 3D geospatial company Cesium; a strategic partnership with Google to integrate their geospatial content; a new product portfolio for asset analytics and a new generation of engineering applications, both leveraging AI and digital twin technologies to improve the way infrastructure is designed, built, and operated. At the same time, we delivered strong quarterly operating results. Our year-over-year ARR growth on a constant currency basis accelerated to 12% in 24Q3 (12.5% excluding China). Strength was broad based across geographies and sectors as we continued to operate at a high level of performance, with favorable end-market conditions for the foreseeable future.\u201d Company Overview Founded by brothers Keith and Barry Bentley, Bentley Systems (NASDAQ:BSY) offers a software-as-a-service platform that addresses the lifecycle of infrastructure projects such as road networks, tunnel systems, and wastewater facilities. Vertical Software Software is eating the world, and while a large number of solutions such as project management or video conferencing software can be useful to a wide array of industries, some have very specific needs. As a result, vertical software, which addresses industry-specific workflows, is growing and fueled by the pressures to improve productivity, whether it be for a life sciences, education, or banking company. Lire la suite Sales Growth Reviewing a company\u2019s long-term performance can reveal insights into its business quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one sustains growth for years. Regrettably, Bentley\u2019s sales grew at a sluggish 12.7% compounded annual growth rate over the last three years. This shows it failed to expand in any major way, a rough starting point for our analysis. Bentley Total Revenue This quarter, Bentley\u2019s revenue grew 9.3% year on year to $335.2 million, missing Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 11.9% over the next 12 months, similar to its three-year rate. This projection is above the sector average and shows the market thinks its newer products and services will help sustain its historical top-line performance. Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link . Annual Recurring Revenue Investors interested in Bentley should track its annual recurring revenue (ARR) in addition to reported revenue. While reported revenue for a SaaS company can include low-margin items like implementation fees, ARR is a sum of the next 12 months of contracted revenue purely from software subscriptions, or the high-margin, predictable revenue streams that make SaaS businesses so valuable. Over the last year, Bentley\u2019s ARR growth has slightly outpaced the sector, averaging 11.8% year-on-year increases and punching in at $1.27 billion in the latest quarter. This alternate topline metric has been growing faster than revenue, which likely means that the recurring portions of the business are growing faster than less predictable, choppier ones such as implementation fees. That could be a good sign for future revenue growth. Bentley Annual Recurring Revenue Customer Retention One of the best parts about the software-as-a-service business model (and a reason why they trade at high valuation multiples) is that customers typically spend more on a company\u2019s products and services over time. Bentley\u2019s net revenue retention rate, a key performance metric measuring how much money existing customers from a year ago are spending today, was 109% in Q3. This means that even if Bentley didn\u2019t win any new customers over the last 12 months, it would\u2019ve grown its revenue by 8.5%. Bentley Net Revenue Retention Rate Bentley has a decent net retention rate, showing us that its customers not only tend to stick around but also get increasing value from its software over time. Key Takeaways from Bentley\u2019s Q3 Results It was good to see Bentley beat analysts\u2019 ARR expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its revenue, billings, EPS, and EBITDA missed analysts\u2019 expectations. Overall, this quarter could have been better. The stock traded down 2.2% to $48.80 immediately after reporting. Bentley\u2019s latest earnings report disappointed. One quarter doesn\u2019t define a company\u2019s quality, so let\u2019s explore whether the stock is a buy at the current price. The latest quarter does matter, but not nearly as much as longer-term fundamentals and valuation, when deciding if the stock is a buy. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it\u2019s free .
