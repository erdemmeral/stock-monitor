[{"text": "All You Need to Know About Alto Neuroscience, Inc. (ANRO) Rating Upgrade to Buy Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 8, 2025, 8:00 PM 4 min read In This Article: ANRO -2.56% Alto Neuroscience, Inc. (ANRO) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices. A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years. Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements. As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Alto Neuroscience, Inc. is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price. Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock. Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Alto Neuroscience, Inc. imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher. Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Bottom Line Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating.

(\"Alto\") (NYSE: ANRO) a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel precision medicines for neuropsychiatric disorders, today announced multiple presentations at the 63 rd annual meeting of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ACNP), in Phoenix, Arizona, held December 8-11, 2024. \"At this year\u2019s ACNP meeting, we highlighted the continued progress across our pipeline and precision psychiatry platform,\" said Amit Etkin, M.D., Ph.D., founder and chief executive officer of Alto Neuroscience. \"Notably, we shared exciting new mechanistic findings that support the ALTO-300 biomarker. Extensive literature suggests that dopaminergic activity stabilizes neural signaling and ALTO-300, which blocks the 5-HT2C serotonin receptor, has been shown to increase dopamine release. As demonstrated by new data, the ALTO-300 biomarker is a measure of reduced neural signal stability and can be generated by activating the 5-HT2C receptor. These insights enhance our understanding of the patient phenotype we are studying in our ongoing Phase 2b study and provide clear mechanistic relevance to our machine-learning derived biomarker. We believe the reverse translation of this biomarker underscores the promise of our precision medicine approach and brings us closer to developing more effective, targeted treatments through a deeper understanding of neurobiological processes in defined patient subtypes. This is enhanced by the scalability of our EEG biomarker, which is calculated based on signal from a single electrode.\" The details of each presentation are as follows: Presentation Title : Neural and Molecular Mechanistic Correlates of an EEG Biomarker Predictive of the Antidepressant Response to ALTO-300 in Patients with Major Depression Presentation Highlights : Background: ALTO-300, an oral, small molecule designed to act as a melatonin agonist and 5-HT2C antagonist, is an approved antidepressant medication in Europe and Australia. Along with a range of synergistic neurobiological effects, ALTO-300 has been shown to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic input to the frontal cortex and rescue anhedonia-like behavioral deficits. Response to ALTO-300 is predicted by greater levels of sample entropy, a measure of resting-state EEG (rsEEG) irregularity. Human connectivity analysis: Greater sample entropy is associated with decreased neural connectivity. Across multiple independent datasets (N=784), biomarker positive patients demonstrated reduced medial prefrontal neural connectivity, a brain region frequently implicated in MDD. Reverse-translation preclinical study: In mice (N=13), administration of a 5-HT2C agonist (R0-0175) led to a dose-related increase in sample entropy, consistent with a biomarker positive phenotype. These results tie the human-discovered EEG biomarker to ALTO-300\u2019s molecular mechanism of action, as a 5-HT2C antagonist. Key Takeaway: The ALTO-300 biomarker is characterized by reduced medial prefrontal neural connectivity, providing functional evidence of the consequence of more irregular neural signal, which may reflect an increase in 5-HT2C activity in patients. This biomarker, which was previously identified and prospectively replicated, is being used to select patients for the ongoing Phase 2b study of ALTO-300 as an adjunctive treatment in patients with MDD (NCT05922878). Story Continues Presentation Title : Validation of Assessments for Reward Processing for Use in a Phase 2 Study of a Novel Histamine H3 Inverse Agonist, ALTO-203, in Major Depression Presentation Highlights : Background: Established tests of reward processing tend to be lengthy and poorly tolerated. Two novel computerized cognitive tests for different aspects of reward processing and motivation were developed, validated and examined in relationship to anhedonia. Effort Tapping is a paradigm where participants can earn +10 (low reward) or +100 points (high reward) based on rate of finger tapping. Anhedonia was hypothesized to relate to the ability to mobilize effort and achieve greater reward. The Probabilistic Instrumental Learning Task (PILT) is an adaptation of a classic, two-choice learning test, which measures the ability to learn arbitrary stimulus-reward probabilistic associations. Anhedonia was hypothesized to be associated with a lower learning rate and increased decision noise, as dopamine release has been shown to be a driver of learning in similar paradigms. Results: Compared to established tests of reward processing, Effort Tapping and PILT showed strong test-retest reliability, are shorter and better tolerated, and display stronger evidence of construct and external validity through association with anhedonia and motivation, than established reward tasks. Associations were furthermore replicated across two large studies. Key Takeaway: These novel tasks may be used to more effectively characterize pharmacodynamic effects of ALTO-203 in the ongoing Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial in patients with MDD and anhedonia (NCT06391593). Presentation Title : Prevalence and Correlates of Cognitive Impairment in Depression: Findings from the Texas Resilience Against Depression Study Presentation Highlights : Background: Cognitive impairment (CI) in MDD is associated with worse clinical and functional outcomes in depression. Results: Across participants (N=391), 51% met the criteria for CI, a highly stable phenotype similarly evident across age groups and different levels of premorbid cognitive function. Individuals with CI and depression are no more depressed or anxious than non-CI depressed, but are more likely to report impairments in activities, worse quality of life, and greater anhedonia and suicidality. Key Takeaway: Findings from the Texas Resilience Against Depression study (T-RAD; NCT02919280) underscore the high unmet need for patients with MDD who experience CI, comprising approximately 50% of the overall MDD population. During ACNP, Dr. Etkin participated in a panel discussion, titled Neuroimaging in Psychiatry: Toward Mechanistic Insights and Clinical Utility to discuss advances and the implementation of neuroimaging tools for psychiatric treatment development, both in industry and academia. Today, the Company also announced that it plans to conduct an interim analysis for the ongoing Phase 2b trial of ALTO-300. Following the completion of the ALTO-100 Phase 2b trial in MDD, the Company conducted a thorough review of patients included in its ongoing trials. Based on learnings from this review, the Company expects the planned interim analysis to be used to inform the final sample size needed to achieve adequate powering of the ALTO-300 Phase 2b trial. The Company expects to conduct and report the outcome from the interim analysis in the first quarter of 2025.

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., November 12, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Alto Neuroscience, Inc. (\"Alto\") (NYSE: ANRO) a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel precision medicines for neuropsychiatric disorders, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and highlighted recent corporate progress. \"We have sharpened our clinical focus, which we expect will propel us forward to multiple near-term milestones, including MDD readouts anticipated in the first half of 2025 for ALTO-300 and ALTO-203,\" said Amit Etkin, M.D., Ph.D., founder and chief executive officer of Alto Neuroscience. \"While we were disappointed that the ALTO-100 Phase 2b study did not achieve the primary outcome, there are important findings within the data, which we believe will enable us to enhance the likelihood of success with our other ongoing clinical studies. We are encouraged by the potential benefit of ALTO-100, as demonstrated in the adjunctive population, and of our biomarker approach in patients with confirmed drug compliance, showing that enrichment resulted in a meaningful difference and greater improvement in patients with the cognitive biomarker. I am proud of our team for completing this study\u2014which we believe was the first large-scale, double-blind, biomarker driven trial in psychiatry\u2014and plan to incorporate learnings from this data set across our other programs. With a strong cash runway into 2027, we are well positioned to drive forward our differentiated pipeline, targeting unique, biomarker-defined patient populations.\" Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Business Highlights ALTO-100: Phase 2b in Bipolar Depression ongoing, reported topline data from Phase 2b MDD study. ALTO-100, a first-in-class, oral small molecule believed to work through enhancing neural plasticity, is in development for mood disorders. Story Continues In October 2024, the Company reported topline results in a Phase 2b trial evaluating ALTO-100 as a treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). The cognitive biomarker-defined MDD (biomarker positive) patient group treated with ALTO-100 did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in depressive symptoms compared to placebo in the overall modified intention to treat (mITT) population (n=196 biomarker-positive, including those receiving ALTO-100 or placebo as a monotherapy or adjunctive to an antidepressant to which they had an inadequate response). ALTO-100 continued to demonstrate a favorable safety and tolerability profile, with no new safety signals observed in this study. Overall, placebo response was well-managed and the biomarker did not enrich for a larger placebo response in the study. In a pre-specified analysis of biomarker positive patients taking ALTO-100 or placebo adjunctively to a stable background antidepressant (n=61), ALTO-100 demonstrated a clinically meaningful effect compared to placebo at week 6 (Cohen\u2019s d=0.47, p=0.09). The pre-specified analysis of this population was not powered to achieve statistical significance. In the Phase 2b trial there was a higher-than-anticipated level of non-compliance with taking study medication in the monotherapy group, which was not evident in the adjunctive treatment group. In a subset of patients that had evidence of taking ALTO-100 through blood sample analysis, the patients with the ALTO-100 cognitive biomarker demonstrated a greater improvement than those without the biomarker. Alto does not currently intend to advance ALTO-100 in MDD. ALTO-100 is currently being evaluated as an adjunctive treatment in a Phase 2b study in bipolar depression with topline data expected in 2026. ALTO-300 (agomelatine): Enrollment on track in Phase 2b adjunctive MDD trial. ALTO-300, an oral, small molecule designed to act as a melatonin agonist and 5-HT2C antagonist, is being developed as an adjunctive treatment in the United States for patients with MDD, characterized by an EEG biomarker. Agomelatine is an approved antidepressant medication in Europe and Australia, but has not been approved in the United States. Enrollment in the Phase 2b MDD trial remains on track with topline data expected in the first half of 2025. The double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study is expected to enroll 200 patients characterized by an EEG biomarker signature. Patients will receive ALTO-300 or placebo in addition to a background antidepressant, to which they have had inadequate response, over a 6-week treatment period. The primary outcome is the change from baseline in MADRS score. This study builds on positive results from Alto\u2019s completed Phase 2a trial and data from completed trials of agomelatine by other sponsors that demonstrated effects on depression symptoms. Approximately 50% of patients with MDD are estimated to be positive for the ALTO-300 EEG biomarker. ALTO-203: Enrollment on track in Phase 2 proof-of-concept MDD trial. ALTO-203, a novel, oral small molecule designed to uniquely act as a histamine H3 inverse agonist, is being developed for the treatment of MDD associated with increased levels of anhedonia. Enrollment in the Phase 2 proof-of-concept (POC) trial in MDD patients with higher levels of anhedonia remains on track with topline data expected in the first half of 2025. Alto expects to enroll approximately 60 patients in the study, which consists of two sequential double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment periods with two dose levels of ALTO-203 as a monotherapy. In the first period, patients will receive a single-dose of ALTO-203 or placebo, and the outcome measure is designed to evaluate pharmacodynamic effects. An acute change in positive emotion will be assessed by the alertness and mood components of the Bond-Lader Visual Analog Scale (BL-VAS), an established scale of subjective emotion also used in a prior Phase 1 trial of ALTO-203. In the second period, patients will receive ALTO-203 or placebo once daily over a 28-day treatment period to evaluate the clinical activity and safety of ALTO-203. The study is powered based on the outcomes being evaluated in the first period. The clinical outcomes, e.g., MADRS, are not powered to detect statistical significance. ALTO-101: Phase 2 proof-of-concept CIAS trial ongoing, topline data on track for 2H 2025. ALTO-101, a brain-penetrant PDE4 inhibitor designed as a novel transdermal formulation, is being developed for the treatment of Cognitive Impairment Associated with Schizophrenia (CIAS). Through this unique formulation, ALTO-101 is designed to retain the desired brain effects shown with the oral formulation and avoid tolerability challenges and adverse effects known to be associated with PDE4 inhibitors. Topline data from the Phase 2 POC trial is expected by the end of 2025. The Phase 2 POC trial consists of a cross-over, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating treatment with ALTO-101 and Alto expects to enroll approximately 70 adults with schizophrenia. The primary outcome in the study is the effect of ALTO-101 on theta band activity, the EEG measure shown to be best related to CIAS in replicated analyses of large schizophrenia datasets. Objective cognitive performance will also be evaluated.

The Company expects its cash balance to support planned operations into 2027. R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $13.1 million, as compared to $8.0 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to costs associated with the Phase 2b clinical studies for ALTO-100 and ALTO-300, and the Phase 2 POC studies for ALTO-203 and ALTO-101. G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $5.8 million, as compared to $1.8 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to costs associated with higher headcount to support expanded clinical development efforts, growing operational requirements, and costs associated with operating as a public company. The increase in personnel costs includes $0.9 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Net Loss: The Company incurred a net loss of $16.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $9.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.
