In This Article: BLK -5.74% (Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. stuck agreements with Boaz Weinstein\u2019s Saba Capital Management that will end the activist-hedge fund\u2019s battle with BlackRock over dozens of closed-end funds whose share prices had tumbled deeply below the value of their underlying assets.

Saba also entered so-called standstill agreements with 48 other BlackRock funds, according to regulatory filings. BIGZ and BMEZ, which had both had traded at deep discounts in the past, jumped more than 6% on the Tuesday proposals. The two tender offers, at a price of 99.5% of of their net asset values could potentially deliver more than $1.5 billion to shareholders, based on calculation by Bloomberg. Weinstein wrote in a post on X that the changes were made after \u201cconstructive discussions with BlackRock\u201d and that \u201cby committing to shareholder-friendly initiatives, liquidity events and governance enhancements, value can be unlocked for all investors.\u201d Saba has spent years and billions of dollars buying up closed-end funds run by BlackRock and other big asset managers after their share prices dipped sharply below the value of the assets they hold, a trading anomaly that Saba said was harming investors. It mounted proxy fights and court battles in a bid to pressure the firms to take steps to erase that gap, including through tender offers to buy back the stock. Last year, Boaz ran proxy fights at 10 BlackRock funds with mixed outcomes. It also sued BlackRock\u2019s ESG Capital Allocation Term Trust (ticker ECAT) over its voting bylaws, which is still subject to litigation in a federal court. Weinstein\u2019s fights center around funds that buy income-producing assets, like junk bonds, municipal debt or dividend-paying stocks, that were hit hard when the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates and investors were looking to bail out. With their performances trailing market benchmarks, the discounted trading prices saddled investors with losses if they sold. Story Continues The hedge fund manager is bringing a similar playbook to UK\u2019s investment-trust industry and attempting to seize control of a bunch of those firms, including two trusts run by Janus Henderson Group Plc.

Wire Fri, Jan 3, 2025, 12:30 AM 8 min read In this article: BCX -1.11% BGY -1.81% BME +0.02% BDJ -0.23% BGR +0.91% NEW YORK, January 02, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--The BlackRock closed-end funds (the \"Funds\") listed below announced today the results of the Quarterly Measurement Period (as defined below) under their previously announced discount management programs (the \"Programs\"). Funds with a Trigger Event (as defined below) at the end of the Quarterly Measurement Period also announced the dates of tender offers. The Programs are part of the Funds\u2019 ongoing efforts to manage discounts and enhance long-term shareholder value and provide liquidity to the market for their common shareholders. There can be no assurances as to the effect that a Program will have on the market for a Fund\u2019s shares or the discount at which a Fund\u2019s shares may trade relative to its NAV. As previously announced, under the Programs, each Fund intends to offer to repurchase a portion of its outstanding common shares based on 3-month measurement periods (each a \"Measurement Period\") if the Fund's common shares trade at an average daily discount to net asset value (\"NAV\") of greater than 7.50% during a Measurement Period (a \"Trigger Event\"). The Funds\u2019 Measurement Period commenced on October 1, 2024 and ended on December 31, 2024 (the \"Quarterly Measurement Period\"). The average daily discount to NAV for each of the Funds during the Quarterly Measurement Period is summarized below. Quarterly Measurement Period Discount Results for the Funds in the Program Fund Name Ticker Average Daily Discount for the Measurement Period ended December 31, 2024 BlackRock Capital Allocation Term Trust BCAT -5.19% BlackRock ESG Capital Allocation Term Trust ECAT -4.71% BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust BIGZ -10.52% BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust BMEZ -10.91% BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust BSTZ -9.58% BlackRock Enhanced Global Dividend Trust BOE -10.36% BlackRock Energy and Resources Trust BGR -8.74% BlackRock Enhanced International Dividend Trust BGY -10.08% BlackRock Enhanced Large Cap Core Fund, Inc.

MVF -8.28% BlackRock Utilities, Infrastructure, & Power Opportunities Trust BUI -1.35% The Funds\u2019 Boards of Directors/Trustees (the \"Boards\") determined that if a Trigger Event occurred during the Quarterly Measurement Period with respect to a Fund, the Fund would offer to repurchase a portion of its outstanding common shares by conducting a tender offer for 2.5% of its outstanding common shares at a price equal to 98% of the Fund\u2019s NAV per share as determined as of the close of the regular trading session of the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") on the next day the NAV is calculated after the expiration date of the tender offer or, if the offer is extended, on the next day the NAV is calculated after the day to which the offer is extended. As a result of the occurrence of a Trigger Event during the Quarterly Measurement Period with respect to each of the following Funds, the Board of each such Fund has authorized the Fund\u2019s tender offer with the anticipated commencement and expiration dates outlined below. Story continues Event MVF, BME BGR, BIGZ, BMEZ, CII BGY, BSTZ, BOE, BCX Tender Offer Commencement Date Tuesday, January 21, 2025 Wednesday, January 22, 2025 Thursday, January 23, 2025 Tender Offer Expiration Date and Time Thursday, February 20, 2025 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, unless otherwise extended Friday, February 21, 2025 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, unless otherwise extended Monday, February 24, 2025 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, unless otherwise extended If more than 2.5% of a Fund's outstanding common shares are tendered, the Fund will purchase its shares from tendering shareholders on a pro rata basis at a price equal to 98% of the Fund's NAV per share as determined as of the close of the regular trading session of the NYSE on the next day the NAV is calculated after the expiration date of the tender offer (or, if the offer is extended, on the next day the NAV is calculated after the day to which the offer is extended). Accordingly, there is no assurance that a Fund will purchase all of a shareholder\u2019s common shares tendered in the tender offer. Payments for shares tendered and accepted are expected to be made within approximately five business days after the expiration date. The terms and conditions of each Fund\u2019s tender offer will be set forth in an Offer to Purchase, a related Letter of Transmittal, and related documents, which will be distributed to the respective Fund's common shareholders. As soon as its tender offer commences, each Fund will file a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), which will include an Offer to Purchase and related Letter of Transmittal.
