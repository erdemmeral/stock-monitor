[{"text": "Here is Why Growth Investors Should Buy Funko-A (FNKO) Now Zacks Equity Research Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 8:45 PM 3 min read In This Article: FNKO -2.71% Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task. That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss. However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects. Our proprietary system currently recommends Funko-A (FNKO) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank. Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better. While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below: Earnings Growth Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration. While the historical EPS growth rate for Funko-A is 64.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 413.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 13.7%. Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio Asset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales. Right now, Funko-A has an S/TA ratio of 1.37, which means that the company gets $1.37 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 1.02, it can be said that the company is more efficient. In addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Funko-A is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 11% this year versus the industry average of 1.8%. Story Continues Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions Beyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. The current-year earnings estimates for Funko-A have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.9% over the past month. Bottom Line While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Funko-A a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. This combination indicates that Funko-A is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.

Zacks Equity Research Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 5:40 PM 2 min read In This Article: FNKO -2.71% While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks, we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies. With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies. Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks. Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the \"Value\" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, \"A\" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today. One company value investors might notice is Funko (FNKO) . FNKO is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) and a Value grade of A. We should also highlight that FNKO has a P/B ratio of 3. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 6.55. Over the past year, FNKO's P/B has been as high as 3.27 and as low as 1.33, with a median of 2.30. Finally, investors will want to recognize that FNKO has a P/CF ratio of 16.23. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 38.74. Over the past 52 weeks, FNKO's P/CF has been as high as 26.26 and as low as -8.67, with a median of 13.75.

From heart-shaped pasta to Funko\u2019s new senior vice president of brand, here\u2019s our closeout for the week. What you may have missed Foot Locker names Sonia Syngal to board of directors Foot Locker on Tuesday announced two additions to its board of directors , including former Gap Inc. CEO Sonia Syngal . Syngal, who is also on Tanger\u2019s board, has two decades of experience in retail, including in e-commerce, supply chain, brand strategy, operations and marketing, per a company press release. Also joining the board is Ace Hardware CEO John Venhuizen, who has spent 12 years in the top spot and 30 at the hardware retailer overall.

New Balance sales hit a record New Balance this week said its global sales hit a record $7.8 billion in 2024, a year that\u2019s been tough for sneaker brands like Nike and Under Armour, as well as some resale sites. This was a 20% increase from the previous year and a whopping 136% from five years ago. The company credits its partnerships with Olympic gold medalist and world record holder Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone and Los Angeles Dodgers designated hitter Shohei Ohtani, plus its collabs with brands like Kith and Aim\u00e9 Leon Dore. \u201cThrough selective partnerships and distribution, they\u2019ve elevated the brand to premium status while breathing new life into retro styles that resonate with younger consumers like never before,\u201d the 119-year-old brand said in an emailed press release. Story Continues Retail therapy That don\u2019t impress me much Earlier this week, Walmart unveiled what it called \u201ca comprehensive brand refresh\u201d \u2014 the first of its kind since 2008 . The refresh includes more vibrant yellows and blues, greater emphasis on its spark logo and a new wordmark that was inspired by founder Sam Walton\u2019s classic trucker hat. While Walmart dubs this the first refresh in nearly 20 years, onlookers weren\u2019t impressed. Commenting on the changes, one X user commented \u201csimply increase saturation a bit and you have a bold new direction,\u201d while another sarcastically called the refresh \u201cso bold and visionary.\u201d Even discount grocer Aldi poked fun at the retail giant\u2019s big reveal, posting side-by-side images of its logo on Instagram with the caption \u201cSpot the difference! #IYKYK\u201d Walmart seems to have stayed in good spirits despite the backlash, even poking fun at itself. On its X account on Wednesday, the retailer posted increasingly thicker versions of its spark logo with the text, \u201cThe future is bright\u2026and slightly more thick.\u201d Pasta lovers unite Ahead of Valentine\u2019s Day, Barilla Canada released heart-shaped pasta on Wednesday. The limited-edition Barilla Love Pasta will be available at Walmart, IGA, Metro Quebec and other grocery stores based in Canada while supplies last. The pasta debuted in the U.S. in previous years and per Barilla, \u201cCanadians pleaded with the brand to make the special pasta available,\u201d in the country. What we\u2019re still thinking about 61 That\u2019s how many years Ronald S. Lauder spent with Est\u00e9e Lauder before his recent retirement from the board of directors . On Jan. 10, Est\u00e9e Lauder said the longtime executive and board member, who joined the company in 1964, would retire from the company\u2019s board of directors. In his time at the company, Ronald Lauder served on the board from 1968 to 1986, from 1988 to July 2009 and from 2016 till now. He designated two directors of the company per a shareholder agreement with the Lauder family: his daughter Jane Lauder and son-in-law Eric Zinterhofer. Ronald Lauder plans to remain chairman of Clinique Laboratories. 3,283 That\u2019s how many retail-related job cuts there were in December , up 2,800% from the year-ago period when there were 110 cuts, according to a recent report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. From the previous month, December\u2019s job cuts grew nearly 45%. While cuts in December grew, for the full year retail downsizing narrowed by 47%. Retailers continued to make hires during the year as well, with the number of hirings reaching 536,600 in 2024, compared to 440,893 in 2023. What we\u2019re watching Will the California fire recovery drive home improvement growth? As residents and businesses attempt to recover from the devastation of the Los Angeles-area wildfires, growth is likely to surge for some retail sectors in the coming years. In a Wednesday note, Wells Fargo analysts said home improvement retail \u2014 companies like The Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s and Tractor Supply \u2014 are likely well-positioned for growth due to rebuilding-related demand as the emergency situation is brought under control. As of Friday, about 25 people had died, over 40,000 acres had burned and more than 12,300 structures were destroyed , according to state officials. In the two largest incidents, the Palisades fire was about 31% contained, while the Eaton fire was 65% contained as of Friday, per The Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. AccuWeather figures cited by Wells Fargo estimated the total damage and economic loss ranged between $250 billion and $275 billion. Assuming 75% of the structures were housing units and rebuilding materials will cost between $1 million to $2 million per unit, that could represent a $10 billion to $20 billion home improvement sector tailwind during the next one to two years, Wells Fargo said. Wayfair, RH and others in the home furnishings segment are also likely to see a benefit as area residents refurnish their homes.

Jan 8, 2025, 8:45 PM 3 min read In This Article: FNKO -2.71% Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all. That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss. However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks. Funko-A (FNKO) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank. Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below: Earnings Growth Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration. While the historical EPS growth rate for Funko-A is 64.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 413.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 12.3%. Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio Growth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.

{"text": "Start 2025 With 4 Power-Packed Relative Price Strength Stocks Nilanjan Choudhury Wed, Jan 8, 2025, 4:12 PM 5 min read In This Article: ^GSPC -0.76% SUPV -2.92% FNKO -2.71% VST +0.30% AMZN -0.11% The U.S. stock market has been on an exceptional rally since 2023, with the S&P 500 surging 24.2% that year, followed by a 23.3% gain in 2024. This two-year climb of 53% marks the index's best performance since 1997-98. Despite December's 2.5% decline, casued by inflation concerns and cautious Federal Reserve policies, the market\u2019s strong fundamentals and economic resilience suggest continued upward momentum in 2025. With a potential rate cut on the horizon and a solid economic backdrop, investors can capitalize on relative price strength as a robust strategy. This approach favors stocks with proven performance amid market volatility, aligning well with ongoing recovery. At this stage, investors would be wise to consider stocks like Amazon.com AMZN, Vistra Corp. VST, Funko, Inc. FNKO and Grupo Supervielle S.A. SUPV based on their relative price strength. Relative Price Strength Strategy Earnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine a stock's ability to offer considerable returns. But these are also essential for determining whether a stock\u2019s price performance is better than its peers or the industry average. If a stock\u2019s performance is lacking that of the broader groups, despite impressive earnings growth or valuation multiples, then something must be wrong. It\u2019s always advisable to stay away from these stocks and bet on those that are outperforming their respective industry or benchmark. This is because betting on a winner always proves to be lucrative. Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&P 500 for 1 to 3 months, at least, and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy. Finally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter\u2019s (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains. Screening Parameters Relative % Price change \u2013 12 weeks greater than 0 Relative % Price change \u2013 4 weeks greater than 0 Relative % Price change \u2013 1 week greater than 0 (We have considered those stocks that have been outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 12 weeks, four weeks and one week.) % Change (Q1) Est. over 4 Weeks greater than 0: Positive current-quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks. Zacks Rank equal to 1 : Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks \u2014 that have returned more than 26% annually over the last 26 years and surpassed the S&P 500 in 23 of the last 26 years \u2014 can get through. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Current Price greater than or equal to $5 and Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: A minimum price of $5 is a good standard to screen low-priced stocks, while a high trading volume would imply adequate liquidity. VGM Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.

"Those who invested in Funko (NASDAQ:FNKO) a year ago are up 87% editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Tue, Jan 7, 2025, 6:37 PM 2 min read In This Article: FNKO -2.71% The simplest way to invest in stocks is to buy exchange traded funds. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, the Funko, Inc. ( NASDAQ:FNKO ) share price is up 87% in the last 1 year, clearly besting the market return of around 24% (not including dividends). If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term, investors will do very well! Unfortunately the longer term returns are not so good, with the stock falling 23% in the last three years. With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for Funko Funko isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally hope to see good revenue growth. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one would hope for good top-line growth to make up for the lack of earnings. In the last year Funko saw its revenue shrink by 8.0%. Despite the lack of revenue growth, the stock has returned a solid 87% the last twelve months. To us that means that there isn't a lot of correlation between the past revenue performance and the share price, but a closer look at analyst forecasts and the bottom line may well explain a lot. The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image). NasdaqGS:FNKO Earnings and Revenue Growth January 7th 2025 Take a more thorough look at Funko's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet . A Different Perspective We're pleased to report that Funko shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 87% over one year. That certainly beats the loss of about 2% per year over the last half decade. The long term loss makes us cautious, but the short term TSR gain certainly hints at a brighter future. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Funko better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 2 warning signs with Funko , and understanding them should be part of your investment process. Of course Funko may not be the best stock to buy . So you may wish to see this free collection of growth stocks.

Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 8, 2025, 5:15 PM 4 min read In This Article: K +0.04% FNKO -2.71% Shares of Kellanova (K) have been strong performers lately, with the stock up 0.8% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $81.39 in the previous session. Kellanova has gained 0.5% since the start of the year compared to the 10.7% move for the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the 11.2% return for the Zacks Consumer Products - Discretionary industry. What's Driving the Outperformance? The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on October 31, 2024, Kellanova reported EPS of $0.91 versus consensus estimate of $0.85. For the current fiscal year, Kellanova is expected to post earnings of $3.93 per share on $12.74 billion in revenues. Meanwhile, for the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $4.03 per share on $12.98 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 4.81% and 1.91%, respectively. Valuation Metrics Kellanova may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself. On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style. Kellanova has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A. In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 20.7X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 13.7X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 18.1X versus its peer group's average of 8.2X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.49. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective. Zacks Rank We also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Kellanova currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates. Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Kellanova meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Kellanova shares could still be poised for more gains ahead. Story Continues How Does K Stack Up to the Competition? Shares of K have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Funko, Inc. (FNKO) . FNKO has a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of B. Earnings were strong last quarter. Funko, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 250%, and for the current fiscal year, FNKO is expected to post earnings of $0.38 per share on revenue of $1.04 billion. Shares of Funko, Inc. have gained 20.4% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 36.74X and a P/CF of 267.61X. The Consumer Products - Discretionary industry may rank in the bottom 87% of all the industries we have in our universe, but there still looks like there are some nice tailwinds for K and FNKO, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.

FNKO is Risky and One Stock to Buy Instead Radek Strnad Wed, Jan 1, 2025, 12:04 PM 3 min read In This Article: FNKO -2.71% Three Reasons Why FNKO is Risky and One Stock to Buy Instead The past six months have been a windfall for Funko\u2019s shareholders. The company\u2019s stock price has jumped 44.3%, hitting $13.39 per share. This performance may have investors wondering how to approach the situation. Is now the time to buy Funko, or should you be careful about including it in your portfolio? See what our analysts have to say in our full research report, it\u2019s free . We\u2019re glad investors have benefited from the price increase, but we don't have much confidence in Funko. Here are three reasons why we avoid FNKO and a stock we'd rather own. Why Do We Think Funko Will Underperform? Boasting partnerships with media franchises like Marvel and One Piece, Funko (NASDAQ:FNKO) is a company specializing in creating and distributing licensed pop culture collectibles. 1. Long-Term Revenue Growth Disappoints A company\u2019s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Unfortunately, Funko\u2019s 5.1% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was sluggish. This fell short of our benchmark for the consumer discretionary sector. Funko Quarterly Revenue 2. EPS Trending Down Analyzing the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) shows whether a company's incremental sales were profitable \u2013 for example, revenue could be inflated through excessive spending on advertising and promotions. Sadly for Funko, its EPS declined by 43% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 5.1%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded. Funko Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) 3. New Investments Fail to Bear Fruit as ROIC Declines A company\u2019s ROIC, or return on invested capital, shows how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity). We typically prefer to invest in companies with high returns because it means they have viable business models, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is often what surprises the market and moves the stock price. Over the last few years, Funko\u2019s ROIC has decreased significantly. Paired with its already low returns, these declines suggest its profitable growth opportunities are few and far between. Funko Trailing 12-Month Return On Invested Capital Final Judgment Funko falls short of our quality standards. After the recent rally, the stock trades at 54.1\u00d7 forward price-to-earnings (or $13.39 per share). At this valuation, there\u2019s a lot of good news priced in - you can find better investment opportunities elsewhere. We\u2019d suggest looking at KLA Corporation, a picks and shovels play for semiconductor manufacturing . Stocks We Like More Than Funko The Trump trade may have passed, but rates are still dropping and inflation is still cooling. Opportunities are ripe for those ready to act - and we\u2019re here to help you pick them. Story Continues Get started by checking out our Top 6 Stocks for this week .

Review: Funko (NASDAQ:FNKO) Vs Peers Max Juang Mon, Dec 2, 2024, 2:26 PM 5 min read In This Article: FNKO -2.71% HAS -2.07% Toys and Electronics Stocks Q3 In Review: Funko (NASDAQ:FNKO) Vs Peers Wrapping up Q3 earnings, we look at the numbers and key takeaways for the toys and electronics stocks, including Funko (NASDAQ:FNKO) and its peers. The toys and electronics industry presents both opportunities and challenges for investors. Established companies often enjoy strong brand recognition and customer loyalty while smaller players can carve out a niche if they develop a viral, hit new product. The downside, however, is that success can be short-lived because the industry is very competitive: the barriers to entry for developing a new toy are low, which can lead to pricing pressures and reduced profit margins, and the rapid pace of technological advancements necessitates continuous product updates, increasing research and development costs, and shortening product life cycles for electronics companies. Furthermore, these players must navigate various regulatory requirements, especially regarding product safety, which can pose operational challenges and potential legal risks. The 4 toys and electronics stocks we track reported a satisfactory Q3. As a group, revenues were in line with analysts\u2019 consensus estimates while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 6.6% below.

Market Update As a result of the Fed's rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has come down from frothy levels post-pandemic. The general rise in the price of goods and services is trending towards the Fed's 2% goal as of late, which is good news. The higher rates that fought inflation also didn't slow economic activity enough to catalyze a recession. So far, soft landing. This, combined with recent rate cuts (half a percent in September 2024 and a quarter percent in November 2024) have led to strong stock market performance in 2024. The icing on the cake for 2024 returns was Donald Trump's victory in the US Presidential Election in early November, sending major indices to all-time highs in the week following the election. Still, debates around the health of the economy and the impact of potential tariffs and corporate tax cuts remain. Said differently, there's still much uncertainty around 2025.

Funko-A (FNKO) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.14 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.04 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.03 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 250%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post a loss of $0.14 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.10, delivering a surprise of 171.43%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. Funko-A , which belongs to the Zacks Consumer Products - Discretionary industry, posted revenues of $292.77 million for the quarter ended September 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.14%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $312.94 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Funko-A shares have added about 49.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 24.3%. What's Next for Funko-A? While Funko-A has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Funko-A: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.02 on $325.23 million in revenues for the coming quarter and breakeven on $1.08 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year. Story Continues Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Central Garden (CENT), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2024.

(NASDAQ:FNKO) beat Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q3 CY2024, but sales fell 6.4% year on year to $292.8 million. On the other hand, next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance of $287 million was less impressive, coming in 9.3% below analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.14 per share was above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Funko? Find out in our full research report . Funko (FNKO) Q3 CY2024 Highlights: Revenue: $292.8 million vs analyst estimates of $289.6 million (1.1% beat) Adjusted EPS: $0.14 vs analyst estimates of $0.04 ($0.10 beat) EBITDA: $30.99 million vs analyst estimates of $22.83 million (35.7% beat) Revenue Guidance for Q4 CY2024 is $287 million at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $316.4 million EBITDA guidance for the full year is $87.5 million at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $81.98 million Gross Margin (GAAP): 40.9%, up from 35.2% in the same quarter last year Operating Margin: 4%, up from -1.7% in the same quarter last year EBITDA Margin: 10.6%, up from 8.1% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow was -$4.19 million, down from $810,000 in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $607.5 million \"We reported solid financial results for the 2024 third quarter,\u201d said Cynthia Williams, Chief Executive Officer of Funko. Company Overview Boasting partnerships with media franchises like Marvel and One Piece, Funko (NASDAQ:FNKO) is a company specializing in creating and distributing licensed pop culture collectibles. Toys and Electronics The toys and electronics industry presents both opportunities and challenges for investors. Established companies often enjoy strong brand recognition and customer loyalty while smaller players can carve out a niche if they develop a viral, hit new product. The downside, however, is that success can be short-lived because the industry is very competitive: the barriers to entry for developing a new toy are low, which can lead to pricing pressures and reduced profit margins, and the rapid pace of technological advancements necessitates continuous product updates, increasing research and development costs, and shortening product life cycles for electronics companies. Furthermore, these players must navigate various regulatory requirements, especially regarding product safety, which can pose operational challenges and potential legal risks. Sales Growth Examining a company\u2019s long-term performance can provide clues about its business quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Regrettably, Funko\u2019s sales grew at a sluggish 5.1% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This shows it failed to expand in any major way, a rough starting point for our analysis. \u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80 Funko Total Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within consumer discretionary, a stretched historical view may miss a company riding a successful new product or emerging trend. Funko\u2019s history shows it grew in the past but relinquished its gains over the last two years, as its revenue fell by 11.1% annually. Funko Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Funko\u2019s revenue fell 6.4% year on year to $292.8 million but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 1.1%. Management is currently guiding for a 1.5% year-on-year decline next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 8.8% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus the last two years. Although this projection shows the market thinks its newer products and services will catalyze better performance, it is still below the sector average. Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link . Cash Is King Although earnings are undoubtedly valuable for assessing company performance, we believe cash is king because you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills. Funko has shown poor cash profitability over the last two years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin averaged 2.3%, lousy for a consumer discretionary business. Funko Free Cash Flow Margin Funko burned through $4.19 million of cash in Q3, equivalent to a negative 1.4% margin. The company\u2019s cash burn increased meaningfully year on year and is a deviation from its longer-term margin, raising some eyebrows. Key Takeaways from Funko\u2019s Q3 Results We were impressed by how Funko blew past analysts\u2019 revenue, EPS, and EBITDA expectations this quarter. We were also excited its full-year EBITDA guidance beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates. The one blemish in this print, however, is that its full-year revenue outlook underwhelmed significantly, making this a softer quarter. The stock traded down 1.6% to $12 immediately following the results. Is Funko an attractive investment opportunity at the current price? When making that decision, it\u2019s important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

(NASDAQ:HAS) Firing on All Cylinders Jabin Bastian Wed, Dec 25, 2024, 12:05 PM 4 min read In This Article: HAS -2.07% FNKO -2.71% MAT -4.61% Toys and Electronics Stocks Q3 Earnings: Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) Firing on All Cylinders As the Q3 earnings season wraps, let\u2019s dig into this quarter\u2019s best and worst performers in the toys and electronics industry, including Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) and its peers. The toys and electronics industry presents both opportunities and challenges for investors. Established companies often enjoy strong brand recognition and customer loyalty while smaller players can carve out a niche if they develop a viral, hit new product. The downside, however, is that success can be short-lived because the industry is very competitive: the barriers to entry for developing a new toy are low, which can lead to pricing pressures and reduced profit margins, and the rapid pace of technological advancements necessitates continuous product updates, increasing research and development costs, and shortening product life cycles for electronics companies. Furthermore, these players must navigate various regulatory requirements, especially regarding product safety, which can pose operational challenges and potential legal risks. The 4 toys and electronics stocks we track reported a satisfactory Q3. As a group, revenues were in line with analysts\u2019 consensus estimates while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 6.6% below. In light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady as they are up 2.9% on average since the latest earnings results.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our 9 Best Market-Beating Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

'catastrophic' for the toy industry Josh Lipton \u00b7 Host Sat, Dec 14, 2024, 2:15 AM In This Article: MAT -4.61% FNKO -2.71% SNMSF -6.70% JAKK -1.43% HAS -2.07% Tariffs have become a key policy focus ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House. Like many other industries and consumer products , toys will be hard hit by Trump's tariffs if the incoming Trump administration were to enact these trade restrictions. The Toy Book editor in chief and The Toy Insider senior editor, James Zahn, joins Josh Lipton on Asking for a Trend to take a closer look at how the toy industry will be affected by Trump's tariffs. Tariffs \"could mean some catastrophic results for the toy industry, especially [for] small to mid-sized companies. So some of what we've heard is a 50% to 60% tariff on products coming out of China. Now we're hearing maybe it could be a little bit lower . But anything is bad when you're talking about an industry that produces roughly 80%, 85% of its goods in China.\" Amid geopolitical tensions between the US and China, some toymakers have shifted their production to other countries. \"Funko ( FNKO ) is probably in the best position because they make so much in Vietnam right now, but for the rest of the majors, you've got Jakks Pacific ( JAKK ), Hasbro ( HAS ), Mattel ( MAT ), [and] Spin Master ( TOY.TO ) making so much of their product [in China]. They have diverted some of it to these other countries: Vietnam is picking up a lot [as well as] Malaysia, [and] India want in on the action.\" Related Videos 08:45 Why Trump\u2019s Tariff Idol, McKinley, Abandoned His Own Tariff Policy WSJ \u2022 8 hours ago 03:54 Trump\u2019s Tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China Will Drive Up Expenses WSJ \u2022 9 hours ago 03:11 US delays tariffs on Canada after 'good call' between Trump, Trudeau Yahoo Finance Video \u2022 15 hours ago 04:37 The 'three-fold' applications of Trump's tariff strategy Yahoo Finance Video \u2022 16 hours ago Zahn finds the biggest problem for toymakers will be capacity: \"They don't have the capacity to take on the level and the volume of production that's needed. And they also don't necessarily have the expertise to get that fit and finish the way that the manufacturers need for these products.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trend here .

Positive Points Funko Inc ( NASDAQ:FNKO ) reported a solid overall financial performance for the quarter, with net sales of $293 million, which was at the high end of their guidance range. The company achieved a gross margin of 41% and adjusted EBITA of $31 million, both exceeding the top end of their guidance range. Funko Inc ( NASDAQ:FNKO ) raised the range for adjusted EBITA to $85 million to $90 million for the full year, indicating improved profitability. The company expanded its collaboration with the NFL, allowing fans to customize 'Pop Yourself' with NFL team logos, which exceeded launch expectations. Funko Inc ( NASDAQ:FNKO ) has diversified its supply base, with only about a third of its products manufactured in China, reducing potential tariff impacts. Negative Points Net sales guidance for the full year was lowered to $1.037 billion to $1.05 billion due to cautious consumer spending and wholesale customer caution. Direct to consumer sales were down 7% year over year, indicating challenges in this sales channel. The company anticipates a higher percentage of sales to occur during promotional periods, which may impact gross margins. Funko Inc ( NASDAQ:FNKO ) experienced a decrease in total company liquidity, dropping from $101.6 million to $83.5 million. There is concern about potential capacity challenges if tariffs are enacted, which could lead to a rush to ship products into the U.S. Story Continues Q & A Highlights Q : Are you seeing any trends in point-of-sale (POS) data that justify the cautiousness of wholesalers, and how is direct-to-consumer (DTC) responding to promotional activities? A : Yves Lependeven, CFO: Globally, POS sales were down single digits, with the US down low double digits, while EMEA showed double-digit growth. Consumers seem to be waiting for promotional periods, similar to what we observed in DTC. We expect a significant portion of Q4 sales during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which will likely result in lower gross margins due to increased promotions. Q : How are potential tariffs under the new administration expected to impact Funko, and what is the current manufacturing mix? A : Cynthia Williams, CEO: About a third of our products are manufactured in China, with less than 10% of our Loungefly business already tariffed. We are diversifying our supply base to mitigate risks. If tariffs are enacted, there might be a rush to ship products to the US, which could strain capacity, although 70% of our freight rates are under contract. Q : Can you elaborate on the drivers of higher margins in Q3 and the outlook for Q4? A : Yves Lependeven, CFO: Q3 margins benefited from lower inventory reserves and freight costs. In Q4, we expect more discounting during promotional periods, which will slightly erode gross margins. Increased marketing spend will also impact SG&A, but overall, we anticipate a solid Q4 performance. Q : How is Funko positioned relative to Fanatics, and do you see them as a competitor or partner? A : Cynthia Williams, CEO: We view Fanatics as a partner. While there are some product overlaps, we collaborate on items like NFL Santas and Loungefly bags. Our products complement their offerings, especially with items like clear stadium bags popular among NFL fans. Q : What are the expected cost savings from headcount reductions, and are there plans for further cost improvements or investments? A : Yves Lependeven, CFO: We've annualized most cost savings from last year's reductions. We are reallocating savings to marketing and continue to find operational efficiencies. Cynthia Williams, CEO: We are backfilling key roles and investing in capabilities for growth, such as a customer data platform for DTC business and brand marketing expertise.

On the other hand, we delivered better than expected profitability on improved gross margins, as we did in the first two quarters of this year. \"We've updated our full-year 2024 outlook for net sales to reflect a more cautious consumer environment, which we began to see in the third quarter. We now expect net sales to be at the low end to slightly below our previous range. Adjusted EBITDA is a different matter, we have raised our full-year outlook to above the high end of the range. \"We are deep in the process of developing our strategic plan for 2025 and beyond, and pleased that we have already begun executing several elements of that plan. Recently, we enabled direct-to-consumer shipping capability to Canada, and we expanded our collaboration with the National Football League (NFL), and its fanbase of more than 200 million, to include the option to customize Pop! Yourself with any NFL team logo. Additionally, and just in time for the holidays, we are announcing that Harry Potter accessories will be available to customize Pop!

For a reconciliation of historical adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per share, and adjusted EBITDA, to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, please refer to the \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section of this press release. A reconciliation of adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per share and adjusted EBITDA outlook to the corresponding GAAP measure on a forward-looking basis cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts, as we are unable to provide reconciling information with respect to certain items. However, for the fourth quarter of 2024 the company expects equity-based compensation of approximately $4 million, depreciation and amortization of approximately $15 million and interest expense of approximately $5 million. For the full year 2024, the company expects equity-based compensation of approximately $14 million, depreciation and amortization of approximately $62 million and interest expense of approximately $21 million, each of which is a reconciling item to net loss. See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and the attached reconciliations for more information. Conference Call and Webcast The company will host a conference call at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (1:30 p.m. Pacific Time) today, November 7, 2024, to further discuss its third quarter results and business update. A live webcast and a replay of the event will be available on the Investor Relations section on the Company\u2019s website at investor.funko.com. The replay of the webcast will be available for one year. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This release contains references to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income (loss), including per share amounts, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted net income (loss) margin, which are financial measures that are not prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). Management uses these measures internally for evaluating its operating performance, for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and financials projections, and to assess incentive compensation for our employees, and to evaluate our capacity to expand our business. In addition, our senior secured credit facilities use adjusted EBITDA to measure our compliance with covenants, such as senior leverage ratio. The company's management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information regarding operational performance because it enhances an investor's overall understanding of the financial results for the company's core business. Additionally, it provides a basis for the comparison of the financial results for the company's core business between current, past and future periods as they remove the impact of items not directly resulting from our core operations. The company also believes that including adjusted EBITDA and the other non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release is appropriate to provide additional information to investors and help to compare against other companies in our industry. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should be considered only as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or as a superior measure to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of adjusted net income (loss), including per share amounts, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by our competitors, because not all companies and analysts calculate these measures in the same manner. Detailed reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the financial tables following this release.
