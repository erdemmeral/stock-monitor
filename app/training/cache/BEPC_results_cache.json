[{"text": "The Best High-Yield Energy Stock to Invest $200 in Right Now Reuben Gregg Brewer, The Motley Fool Sun, Jan 26, 2025, 12:40 PM 5 min read In This Article: BEP -4.34% BAM -2.74% If you have $200 available to invest that isn't needed for monthly bills or to pay down short-term debt, you might want to put it toward adding a few shares of Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEP) (NYSE: BEPC) to your portfolio. There are multiple reasons why you might want to do this, including the high yield this energy investment is offering right now. If you are an income investor, here's why Brookfield Renewable should be on your shortlist today. What does Brookfield Renewable do? As Brookfield Renewable's name implies, it is focused on the renewable power sector . The world is transitioning from the dominant energy source being carbon-based fuels to the dominant energy source being cleaner alternatives in the renewable power space. This is not going to be an overnight event -- it will likely play out over decades. While it won't mean the end of carbon fuels, it seems like there is huge growth ahead for wind, solar, battery storage, and nuclear power. Image source: Getty Images. Brookfield Renewable operates in every one of those niches and is a large player in hydroelectric power, an energy source with more constraints on growth. It's one of the most diversified clean energy businesses you can buy. Add to that a reach that spans across North America, South America, Europe, and Asia, and this is basically a one-stop shop for clean energy investing. And it has a proven track record, with dividend increases averaging 6% a year over the past 20 years or so (it wasn't a public entity through all of that period). Brookfield Renewable takes a unique approach Given Brookfield Renewable's electricity focus, many investors might consider it to be a utility-like investment . That's not unreasonable, since its power sales are usually backed by long-term contracts. However, Brookfield Renewable is not a regulated utility, which might have material assets in just one region that it maintains and develops over time in conjunction with regulators. Brookfield Renewable, in contrast, is actually very active on the acquisition and disposition front. Brookfield Renewable likes to step in to buy assets when they look cheap. It then attempts to add value by investing in the assets and running them at a high level. Finally, it will sell assets if it gets a good price. The proceeds are used to repeat the process over again. Sure, there are some assets that management won't sell (hydroelectric is virtually irreplaceable due to its nature, for example). But it's more like an asset manager than a utility, which makes sense given that Brookfield Renewable is run by large Canadian asset manager Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE: BAM) . Story Continues The dividend's steady growth over time, however, shows that the active approach has worked fairly well. Buying Brookfield Renewable is basically a way to invest alongside Brookfield Asset Management in a growing global energy niche. More than one way to reach a goal There are other nuances here to consider. For example, Brookfield Renewable is really a funding vehicle for Brookfield Asset Management's clean energy investments. That's why there are two versions of Brookfield Renewable -- one is a partnership, and the other a regular corporation. They represent the same entity and pay the same dividends. Some large investors can't buy partnerships, so Brookfield Asset Management created the corporate share class to attract more capital. The partnership, which is largely for small investors, has a 6.8% yield. The corporate share class, based only on demand for the different class since they represent the same entity, has a lower 5.6% dividend yield. BEP data by YCharts. There's another reason to like Brookfield Renewable right now. Energy policy in the U.S. market is a bit uncertain, which could upend investment plans for U.S.-focused clean energy businesses. At the very least, it could lead to material investor trepidation. But Brookfield Renewable's globally diversified portfolio means it can pivot to other regions as the U.S. figures out how to move forward on the clean energy front. The time is nigh for Brookfield Renewable If you like the idea of owning a clean energy investment, Brookfield Renewable is going to cover a lot of ground for you. Putting that $200 toward buying now will get you into a stock that has been feeling the pinch of negative investor sentiment, pushing the yield up to very attractive levels even though management remains upbeat about long-term growth opportunities. If you think in decades and not days, Brookfield Renewable, in either form, should be very attractive to you today.

1:47 PM 4 min read In This Article: BEP -4.34% NVO -2.13% SMMT -7.07% Just because Wall Street likes a stock doesn't mean it's a great pick. However, it's not a bad idea to at least consider how analysts view a given stock. After all, their opinions are (or at least, should be) based on a thorough review of the underlying businesses for the stock. Sometimes, analysts are highly bullish about stocks that have great long-term prospects. In some cases, they're so optimistic that their price targets reflect expectations of significant near-term gains. Here are three unstoppable stocks to buy that Wall Street thinks will soar more than 35% over the next 12 months. 1. Brookfield Renewable Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE: BEP) is a limited partnership (LP) that, as its name hints, provides renewable power. The company operates hydroelectric, wind, and solar facilities with a generating capacity of around 37 gigawatts. The Trump administration's energy policies aren't viewed as very friendly for renewable energy stocks . Unsurprisingly, Brookfield Renewable Partners' unit price has plunged nearly 30% below its high set before the U.S. elections in November 2024. Analysts remain upbeat about Brookfield Renewable's prospects, though. The average 12-month price target is 46% higher than the current unit price. Analysts are nearly as bullish about Brookfield Renewable Corporation (NYSE: BEPC) , a sibling stock created a few years ago for investors who didn't want the tax hassles associated with LPs. The average price target for Brookfield Renewable Corporation is around 35% above its current share price. Granted, the political climate in the U.S. might not be as favorable for Brookfield Renewable now as in the past. However, the growing demand for electricity due to the surging adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) should serve as a strong tailwind for the company both in the U.S. and in other countries. Importantly, over 90% of Brookfield Renewable's development pipeline is in the world's top 10 data center markets. 2. Novo Nordisk Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) has ranked among the biggest pharmaceutical companies for a long time. However, it enjoyed unprecedented success in recent years thanks to overwhelming demand for Ozempic and Wegovy. Both products share the same underlying drug -- semaglutide. The big pharma stock has fallen significantly since July 2024. Lower-than-anticipated sales for Ozempic were a big factor behind this decline. Medicare's recent inclusion of Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus (another semaglutide product) on its 2027 list for drug price negotiation caused worries, too. Story Continues However, some on Wall Street believe a rebound could be on the way. The average analysts' 12-month price target for Novo Nordisk reflects an upside potential of 39%. Why is there still so much optimism about Novo Nordisk? Analysts know that Ozempic and Wegovy should continue to enjoy strong demand. They also are looking ahead at the potential for Novo's pipeline. The company has 13 late-stage programs, including CagriSema and an oral version of semaglutide, both of which are promising candidates targeting obesity and type 2 diabetes. 3. Summit Therapeutics Unlike Novo Nordisk, Summit Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SMMT) doesn't have any approved products on the market yet. However, the last word in the previous sentence is important: Summit might not be too far away from leaving the ranks of clinical-stage drugmakers. The company has high hopes for its lead pipeline candidate, ivonescimab. Summit's partner, Chinese drugmaker Akeso , reported results from a late-stage clinical study last year that showed ivonescimab clobbered Merck 's Keytruda in improving progression-free survival among patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Summit's share price understandably skyrocketed after Akesobio's news because the company owns the commercialization rights for ivonescimab in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Japan, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Wall Street thinks the biotech stock can move much higher, with the average price target 50% above Summit's current share price. To be sure, Summit must first announce positive results for ivonescimab in its own clinical trials and win U.S. regulatory approval for the drug. If it does, though, this stock could be an even bigger winner over the long run than Wall Street's price target indicates. Should you invest $1,000 in Brookfield Renewable Partners right now?

read In This Article: O +0.21% BEP -4.34% Many high-quality, higher-yielding dividend stocks underperformed the market last year. The primary culprit has been higher interest rates. Higher rates make lower-risk income investments such as bank CDs and government bonds more attractive to investors. That tends to weigh on the value of higher-yielding dividend stocks, which have a higher risk profile, increasing their yields. Investors can consequently lock in much higher yields on some top-notch dividend stocks these days. Two top dividend stocks to consider doubling up on right now, without overallocating your portfolio, or buying if you don't already own them are Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC) (NYSE: BEP) and Realty Income (NYSE: O) . They offer high-yielding payouts and have visible upside catalysts, which could help power robust total returns for investors in the future. Ample power to pump up its dividend Shares of Brookfield Renewable have slumped more than 10% over the past year. That decline has helped push the renewable energy company's dividend yield above 5.5%. That's several times higher than the S&P 500 's 1.2% dividend yield, which is near its lowest level in more than two decades. Brookfield Renewable's share price declined last year even though it was another strong one for the leading global renewable energy producer. Its funds from operations ( FFO ) were up 11% in the third quarter, keeping it on track to deliver another year of double-digit FFO growth. It benefited from recently completed development projects, acquisitions, and rising power prices. The company expects to continue growing briskly in the coming years. \"The tailwinds for renewables continue to be driven by accelerating corporate demand, primarily from the global technology players to enable their data center and AI development,\" CEO Connor Teskey stated in the third-quarter earnings press release. That accelerating demand is enabling Brookfield to develop more projects. It expected to complete 7 gigawatts (GW) of capacity last year and anticipates that its annual capacity additions will rise to 9.1 GW by 2026. These projects should add 4% to 6% to its FFO per share each year. The company also expects to continue to benefit from accretive acquisitions and from rising power prices -- specifically, notching inflation-linked increases embedded in its existing contracts and securing higher market rates as legacy ones expire. Its growth catalysts drive the view that Brookfield can increase its FFO per share by more than 10% annually for the foreseeable future. That easily supports its plan to grow its dividend at a 5% to 9% annual rate. The company has an excellent record of increasing its dividend, having delivered 6% compound annual growth since 2001. Story Continues Another solid year Shares of Realty Income declined by about 7% last year and are down more than 15% from their 52-week high. That slump has pushed the real estate investment trust's ( REIT ) dividend yield up to almost 6%. Realty Income's stock price slipped even though it had another solid year. The REIT was on track to grow its adjusted FFO per share by around 5%, which is in line with its historical average. A big growth driver was its highly accretive acquisition of Spirit Realty. That enabled the REIT to sidestep some of the headwinds of higher interest rates, which made it more challenging to complete accretive property purchases funded with externally sourced capital (i.e., stock sales and new debt). Despite those headwinds, the REIT was on track to complete an additional $3 billion of property investments last year, exceeding its initial expectations of closing $2 billion of deals. The REIT also revealed a plan late last year to tap the massive private capital market . That strategy will enable it to earn management fee income, enhancing its investment returns. This new approach positions the REIT to make additional accretive acquisitions without needing to fund deals with external capital. Realty Income's growing cash flow has allowed it to continue increasing its dividend. It recently delivered its 128th dividend increase since coming public in 1994. The REIT has now raised its payment for 30 straight years and 109 quarters in a row . T here are trillions of dollars in commercial real estate, so with a massive market opportunity and a new funding source, Realty Income should have no trouble continuing to steadily raise its dividend . A great time to load up on these top-notch dividend stocks Brookfield Renewable and Realty Income slumped last year, largely because of the impact of higher interest rates on the value of higher-yielding dividend stocks. Those declines enable investors to lock in even more lucrative income streams, which is why I recently loaded up on Realty Income . In addition to that income, they offer lots of upside potential as falling interest rates and continued income and dividend growth help boost their stock prices in the coming years.

DiLallo, Neha Chamaria, and Reuben Gregg Brewer, The Motley Fool Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 6:00 PM 6 min read In This Article: BEP -4.34% NEE-PT +0.49% EPD +1.47% ^GSPC -0.76% The energy sector had a rather pedestrian year in 2024. The average energy stock in the S&P 500 gained only 2% on the year, as measured by the return of the Energy Select SPDR ETF , well below the S&P 500's gain of more than 23%. However, while energy stocks were down last year, the sector's future remains bright, given the expected surge in energy demand in the coming years from catalysts like artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. That's why investors should consider holding at least one energy stock in their portfolio. For those with room for only one, Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC) (NYSE: BEP) , Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) , and NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors as the top ones to consider buying now. Brookfield Renewable is a one-stop clean energy stop Reuben Gregg Brewer (Brookfield Renewable): The short-term reason to buy clean energy-focused Brookfield Renewable is that the market has cooled on the renewable power space. After a shocking and rapid price increase that started in 2019, Brookfield Renewable has fallen back to Earth along with the rest of the clean energy sector. ICLN data by YCharts . Having lost more than half its value, Brookfield Renewable is offering a 6.3% yield for its partnership class and a 5.2% yield for its corporate class.\u00a0The two classes are largely identical, with the lower yield for the corporate shares arising from increased investor demand (some large investors, like pension funds, are barred from owning partnerships). Those yields are backed by dividends that have grown regularly over time, and there's no reason to believe Brookfield Renewable won't continue to hit its target of 5% to 9% annual distribution growth. All in, Brookfield Renewable looks like a dividend growth stock currently on sale. The longer-term reason to like Brookfield Renewable is its clean energy focus, where demand is expected to grow for decades. But it is the breadth of Brookfield Renewable's portfolio that is so enticing. It plays in the hydroelectric, solar, wind, storage, and nuclear spaces. And its portfolio is globally diversified. Basically, it can invest opportunistically across the clean energy spectrum. That fits perfectly with its active portfolio approach, as management likes to buy assets when they are cheap, increase their value through investment and astute management, and then sell if a good price is offered. If you are considering clean energy investments, Brookfield Renewable is the one I'd pick. (In fact, I did pick it, buying LP units myself in late 2024.) Story Continues Income and visible growth coming down the pipeline Matt DiLallo (Enterprise Products Partners ): Enterprise Products Partners didn't waste any time extending its distribution growth streak by another year . The master limited partnership (MLP) increased its quarterly distribution by 1.9% compared to its prior payment level earlier this month (and 3.9% above the year-ago level). Because of that, 2025 will mark its 27th straight year of increasing its distribution. With that raise, the midstream giant now yields 6.4%. That provides investors with a very nice base return. In addition to that lucrative income stream, Enterprise Products Partners offers very solid growth prospects. The MLP closed its highly accretive acquisition of Pinon Midstream late last year. The $950 million deal will add about $0.03 per unit to its distributable cash flow this year before factoring in any benefit from commercial and operating synergies. On top of that, the pipeline company will benefit from the completion of expansion projects. Last year, the MLP completed two gas pipeline plants: its Texas Western Products System and the first phase of its Morgan's Point Flex Expansion. Meanwhile, CEO Jim Teague noted in the third-quarter earnings release that it's \"on track to complete construction on two Permian processing plants, the Bahia pipeline, Fractionator 14, Phase 1 of our Neches River NGL Export Terminal and the last phase of our Morgan's Point Terminal Flex Expansion in 2025.\" He added that \"these projects provide visibility to new sources of cash flow for the partnership.\" The MLP is working to secure additional expansion projects that would enhance and extend its long-term growth outlook. It's developing a major offshore oil port project, a carbon dioxide transportation solution, and other projects, including additional gas pipeline capacity to support AI data centers. Meanwhile, Enterprise Products Partners has ample financial flexibility to continue making accretive acquisitions as opportunities arise. With a high-yielding, steadily growing distribution and ample earnings growth coming down the pipeline, Enterprise Products Partners stands out as one of the top energy stocks to consider buying this year. Powerful growth drivers Neha Chamaria (NextEra Energy): Shares of NextEra Energy ended 2024 with 18% gains although they lost nearly 15% in value in the last quarter of the year. The drop seemed unwarranted, given the company's numbers and outlook through 2027, which is why NextEra Energy is among my top energy picks for 2025. NextEra grew its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) by 9% during the first nine months of 2024. Steady capital spending on its utility business, Florida Power & Light Company (FPL), continues to pay off through regular base rate increases and higher revenue. Its renewable energy arm, meanwhile, is steadily growing its backlog. By the end of the third quarter, NextEra Energy's renewables and energy storage backlog had grown to nearly 24 gigawatts (GW). For perspective, the company was then operating around 36 GW of capacity. NextEra Energy estimates that its potential renewable capacity in operation could grow to more than 46 GW by 2027. This growth and regulated returns from FPL should boost NextEra Energy's adjusted EPS by 6% to 8% between 2023 and 2027. Management is also confident about increasing the annual dividend per share by around 10% through 2026. A growing dividend backed by earnings and cash-flow growth should be reflected in NextEra Energy's stock price. NextEra has a solid dividend track record, having grown its dividend per share by a compound annual growth rate of nearly 10% between 2003 and 2023. In the past 10 years alone, the stock has generated nearly 240% in total returns (including reinvested dividends). I believe NextEra Energy should continue to reward shareholders and is a rock-solid stock to buy in 2025 for the long term. Should you invest $1,000 in Brookfield Renewable Partners right now?

Matt DiLallo, The Motley Fool Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 12:21 PM 4 min read In This Article: BEP -4.34% EBGEF -0.29% Generating passive income can help get you on the road to financial freedom. It can help offset some of your expenses, reducing the time you need to actively work to fund your lifestyle . The more passive income you can produce, the less reliant you'll become on your career for income. Buying stocks that pay dividends is a great way to start earning durable passive income . Two great dividend stocks to buy for income right now are Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC) (NYSE: BEP) and Enbridge (NYSE: ENB) . They pay high-yielding dividends that should continue growing in the decades ahead. A powerful passive income stream Brookfield Renewable has paid a very dependable dividend over the past couple of decades. The leading global renewable energy producer has grown its payout at a 6% compound annual rate since 2001. It raised its payment by at least 5% each year since 2011. The company currently pays a dividend yielding more than 5.6%. That's several times higher than the S&P 500 's dividend yield of 1.2%. At that rate, every $100 invested into Brookfield Renewable's stock would produce $5.60 of annual dividend income each year. That compares with only about $1.20 of dividend income from a similar investment in an S&P 500 index fund. Brookfield Renewable aims to increase its dividend at a 5% to 9% annual rate over the long term. It should have plenty of power to achieve that target. The company has several growth drivers, including inflation-linked rate increases, rising power prices, development projects, and acquisitions. Those catalysts drive the company's view that it can grow its funds from operations ( FFO ) per share at a more than 10% annual rate over the next decade. Development projects are a major growth driver for Brookfield Renewable. It currently has a massive 200 gigawatts (GW) of projects under development, compared with its 37 GW operating portfolio. And it has about 65 GW of projects in its advanced stage pipeline that it should complete by 2030. Development projects will grow its FFO per share by about 4% to 6% annually over the next several years. With renewable energy demand only expected to keep growing, Brookfield should be able to continue expanding for decades to come. An income-producing machine Enbridge has been an extremely reliable dividend stock. The Canadian pipeline and utility company has paid dividends to its investors for about 70 years and has raised its payout annually for the past 30 in a row. Its dividend currently yields more than 6%. The company generates very stable cash flow to support its high-yielding dividend. Roughly 98% of its earnings come from cost-of-service agreements or long-term contracts. Those agreements give Enbridge a lot of visibility into its earnings. That's evident by the fact that it was well on its way to delivering its 19th straight year of achieving its annual financial guidance in 2024. Story Continues Enbridge also has a lot of visibility into its future growth prospects. The company had about $27 billion Canadian ($18.7 billion) of secured capital projects in its backlog toward the end of last year. Those projects included additional oil terminal expansions, natural gas pipeline projects, gas utility growth projects, and renewable energy projects. It had expansions on track to come online through 2029. Meanwhile, it had several more under development, including many potential projects to support the growth of lower-carbon energy. The company's massive backlog of secured capital projects helps support its long-term growth outlook. Enbridge expects to grow its cash flow per share at around a 3% annual rate through 2026 and about 5% per year after that. This forecast should support dividend growth in the low to mid-single digits over the coming years. The durability seems likely to continue Brookfield Renewable and Enbridge have already delivered decades of dividend growth. They're well positioned to continue increasing their high-yielding payouts in the decades to come. That makes them excellent dividend stocks to buy right now for those seeking durable passive income streams.

-4.34% O +0.21% VZ +1.50% VICI +0.07% Dividend stocks can be enriching investments. They supply income and have historically produced higher total returns than non-payers. With the stock market rallying last year, dividend yields are down. The S&P 500 's yield is near a 20-year low of 1.2%. However, there are still some attractive dividend stocks out there for those seeking a higher income yield. Here are five top dividend stocks yielding more than 5% to buy this year. Brookfield Renewable Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC) (NYSE: BEP) currently offers a 5.7%-yielding dividend. The leading global renewable energy producer generates lots of stable cash flow to cover its high-yielding payout. It has signed long-term, fixed-rate power purchase agreements with utilities and large corporations for about 90% of its power. Most of those contracts index rates to inflation, accounting for 70% of its revenue. The company has grown its payout at a 6% compound annual rate over the past 20 years. That should continue, with Brookfield Renewable targeting 5% to 9% dividend growth in the future . It's a very achievable goal, given the company's outlook that it can grow its funds from operations ( FFO ) per share at a more than 10% annual rate for the foreseeable future. That growth rate is highly visible and secured through 2029 thanks to inflation-linked rate increases, development projects, and other growth drivers. Enbridge Enbridge 's (NYSE: ENB) dividend yield is around 6% these days . The Canadian pipeline and utility company generates very stable cash flow to support its dividend. About 98% of its earnings come from cost-of-service or contracted assets. Meanwhile, most of those structures have built-in inflation protection. Enbridge's earnings are so predictable that it was well on its way to delivering its 19th straight year of achieving its financial guidance in 2024. The company recently raised its dividend payment, marking its 30th straight year of dividend growth. Enbridge has plenty of fuel to continue increasing its payout. It currently has a massive backlog of commercially secured capital projects under way that should enter service through 2029. They help fuel Enbridge's expectation that it can grow its cash flow per share at a 3% compound annual rate through 2026 and by around 5% per year after that. Realty Income Realty Income 's (NYSE: O) monthly dividend yields 5.8% these days. The real estate investment trust ( REIT ) generates very stable rental income. It has a globally diversified portfolio of properties -- retail, industrial, gaming, and others -- net leased to many of the world's top companies . Net leases require tenants to cover all operating expenses, including routine maintenance, building insurance, and real estate taxes. Story Continues The REIT has an exceptional record of increasing its dividend. It has raised its payout for 30 straight years, including the past 109 quarters in a row . That steady upward trend should continue. Realty Income has an elite financial profile, giving it ample flexibility to continue acquiring additional income-generating properties. It has a long growth runway, given that there are trillions of dollars of commercial real estate across the U.S. and Europe suitable for the net lease structure. Verizon Verizon (NYSE: VZ) pays a 7%-yielding dividend. The telecom giant produces pretty stable cash flow as consumers and businesses pay their wireless and broadband bills. The company generates billions of dollars in cash flow each year, giving it the money to expand its 5G and fiber networks, pay dividends, and strengthen its balance sheet. The company has increased its dividend for 18 straight years, the longest current streak in the U.S. telecom sector. That growth should continue. In addition to organically investing to expand its network, Verizon agreed to buy Frontier Communications in a $20 billion all-cash deal last year to bolster its fiber network. While the transaction won't close for more than a year, it will be immediately accretive to Verizon's earnings when it does while positioning it to capture more than $500 million in cost savings. The growing free cash flow following the deal will also enable Verizon to repay the related debt quickly, ensuring its dividend remains on a solid foundation . Vici Properties Vici Properties ' (NYSE: VICI) dividend yields 5.9%. The REIT also produces very stable income. It owns casinos and other experiential real estate secured by long-term net leases with the operators of those facilities. It also provides financing to develop experiential real estate, which generates interest income. The REIT has increased its payout for seven years in a row, and every year since its formation. It has grown its dividend at a 7% compound annual rate during that period, well above its peer group average of 2.2%. Vici Properties should be able to continue growing its payout in the future. It has multiple growth drivers, including contracts that give it the right to buy additional casino properties from its existing tenants. In addition, many of its financing agreements enable the REIT to purchase those properties and others owned by the same developer in the future. High-yielding and growing income streams Brookfield Renewable, Enbridge, Realty Income, Verizon, and Vici Properties all pay dividends above 5%. More importantly, they back those high-yielding dividends with rock-solid financial profiles. That has enabled the companies to continue investing in growing their business, which has allowed them to steadily increase their dividends . Those features make them great dividend stocks to buy this year for investors seeking a higher-yielding and steadily rising income stream.
