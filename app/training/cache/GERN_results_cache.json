[{"text": "Geron (NASDAQ:GERN) shareholder returns have been stellar, earning 169% in 3 years editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 10:05 PM 2 min read In This Article: GERN -0.70% While Geron Corporation ( NASDAQ:GERN ) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 29% in the last quarter. But that doesn't undermine the rather lovely longer-term return, if you measure over the last three years. In three years the stock price has launched 169% higher: a great result. To some, the recent share price pullback wouldn't be surprising after such a good run. If the business can perform well for years to come, then the recent drop could be an opportunity. After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for Geron Because Geron made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually desire strong revenue growth. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit. Geron's revenue trended up 119% each year over three years. That's well above most pre-profit companies. Along the way, the share price gained 39% per year, a solid pop by our standards. But it does seem like the market is paying attention to strong revenue growth. That's not to say we think the share price is too high. In fact, it might be worth keeping an eye on this one. The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).

Upside Potential Mashaid Ahmed Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 6:02 AM 6 min read In This Article: 002722.SZ -0.97% We recently compiled a list of the 12 Stocks Under $5 With Biggest Upside Potential . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Geron Corporation (NASDAQ: GERN ) stands against other stocks under $5 with biggest upside potential. On January 20, Bloomberg reported that relief swept through the markets as it became clear that Donald Trump would not immediately impose China-specific tariffs on his first day in office, sparking a rally in US equity futures and a decline in the dollar.\u00a0According to people familiar with the plans, the Trump administration is pivoting towards a more engagement-oriented approach with Beijing, rather than pursuing another trade war.\u00a0The administration also plans to issue a memorandum directing federal agencies to study existing trade policies and relationships with China, Canada, and Mexico, rather than imposing new tariffs. This change in strategy has been welcomed by investors, who were concerned that a trade war with China could have significant negative consequences for the global economy. The relief has propelled US equity futures higher, with contracts on the S&P 500 rising 0.5%. The dollar, on the other hand, slumped, with a gauge of the dollar dropping as much as 1.1%.\u00a0Additionally, Trump\u2019s conversation with China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping, which he described as \u201cvery good\u201d, boosted Asian stocks on Monday. However, not all markets were positive, after Trump announced plans to invoke emergency powers to boost domestic energy production while shifting away from renewable sources.

In an interview with CNBC on January 20, Stanley Druckenmiller, Chairman and CEO of Duquesne Family Office, a financial services company, shared his insights on the markets and the incoming administration. Druckenmiller began by describing the current state of the economy, noting that the United States is experiencing a very low unemployment rate of around 4% and a strong GDP growth rate of 3%. He mentioned that, in his 49 years of experience, the country is likely transitioning from the most anti-business administration to the opposite, which has led to a significant shift in business confidence. According to Druckenmiller, CEOs are feeling \u201csomewhere between relieved and giddy\u201d about the change in administration. He cited a recent statement by Paul Ryan that discussed a 32% increase in business confidence over the last 12 months, which Druckenmiller believed was likely a record. This surge in confidence, combined with the strong economic indicators, suggests that the economy will remain robust for at least the next six months. Druckenmiller\u2019s firm is a believer in the concept of \u201canimal spirits,\u201d which refers to the idea that business confidence and sentiment can have a significant impact on economic activity. Story Continues Despite the positive economic indicators, Druckenmiller noted that the earnings yield to bond yield is at its most unattractive level in 20 years. This means that the return on investment in stocks is relatively low compared to the return on bonds, which could make it challenging for the market to continue its upward trend. As a result, Druckenmiller is cautious in his predictions, citing the push and pull between a strong economy and rising bond yields. He acknowledged that every change creates opportunities for price changes, and the radical shift in administration, combined with innovation and deregulation, could lead to significant disruptions in the market. The recent changes in trade policies and economic outlook have created a mix of challenges and opportunities for investors. While there are uncertainties, the overall sentiment in the market remains positive with room for growth.

For Geron Corporation GERN, 2024 was a transformational year as it saw the FDA approval and commercial launch of Rytelo (imetelstat)\u00a0for the treatment of low- to intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with transfusion-dependent anemia in June. Geron\u2019s shares have risen 61.1% in the past year against a decrease of 15.6% for the industry. Here we discuss some reasons for the same. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research GERN\u2019s Rytelo Enjoys Strong Demand Trends The approval of Rytelo gave Geron its first FDA-approved product. In its first full quarter since the U.S. launch, Rytelo recorded sales of $28.2 million (in the third quarter of 2024), which exceeded the company\u2019s expectations. Following high unmet need in lower-risk MDS, Geron is confident of seeing continued demand and momentum for Rytelo. In December, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency gave a positive opinion recommending the approval of Rytelo in the EU. The European Commission\u00a0is expected to give its decision regarding the approval of Rytelo in the first half of 2025. Geron is also evaluating Rytelo in the phase III IMpactMF study in patients with relapsed/refractory myelofibrosis (\u201cMF\u201d). Early findings from the IMproveMF study\u00a0support the potential tolerability of imetelstat and ruxolitinib as a combination therapy for the treatment of MF. GERN\u2019s $375M in Funding Strengthens Balance Sheet Geron also completed important synthetic royalty and debt financing transactions with Royalty Pharma and Pharmakon Advisors, which strengthened the company\u2019s cash position. The synthetic royalty agreement with Royalty Pharma provides it with $125 million of capital in exchange for tiered royalty payments.\u00a0Investment funds managed by Pharmakon Advisors, LP have committed to a 5-year, senior secured term loan of up to $250 million. The funding agreement strengthens the company\u2019s balance sheet to support the commercial launch of Rytelo in the United States and potential launch in the EU, as well as the ongoing study in MF and other uses. Loss Estimates for GERN Narrow In the past 60 days, 2024 loss estimates for Geron have improved from 26 cents per share to 25 cents per share. For 2025, loss estimates have improved from 10 cents to 6 cents per share over the same timeframe. GERN\u2019s Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider Geron has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Talha Qureshi Mon, Jan 6, 2025, 11:30 PM 5 min read In This Article: 002722.SZ -0.97% We recently published a list of the 12 Best Long-Term Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Geron Corporation (NASDAQ:GERN) stands against the other best long-term penny stocks to buy. What\u2019s the Future Like for Small Cap Stocks in 2025? On December 3rd, Bob Kaynor, CFA, Head of US Small & Midcap Equities at Schroders, provided a comprehensive outlook for small-cap stocks in 2025, emphasizing their potential as a cost-effective investment in the robust US economy. He mentioned that the economy has shown resilience post-pandemic, bolstered by fiscal stimulus from the Biden Administration through significant legislation like the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This recovery is primarily driven by strong consumer spending and a favorable labor market. In this robust environment while large-cap equities may appear expensive and have likely priced in much of the anticipated growth, small and mid-cap stocks remain relatively undervalued. This presents an opportunity for investors to gain exposure to domestic economic strength without incurring high costs. Kaynor identified several trends, which he believes could enhance the performance of small and mid-cap stocks in 2025. He pointed out that following a downturn in 2022 and 2023 due to recession fears and high valuations, M&A activity is now rebounding. This resurgence is expected to benefit small-cap stocks as they often become acquisition targets. Additionally, increased IPO activity can generate interest and optimism in the small-cap sector. Moreover, the ongoing and anticipated decline in interest rates starting late 2024 is expected to reduce borrowing costs for small-cap companies, which typically rely on short-term financing. This environment is historically favorable for small caps, particularly when inflation stabilizes between 1% and 3%. Kaynor also noted that the service sector of the market is expanding. The services sector not only forms a significant portion of the GDP but also favors small-cap companies primarily those operating within this space. Moreover, trends like reshoring are enabling small firms to become reliable suppliers for larger corporations. He expects that increased CapEx driven by automation and government support in sectors like semiconductors will likely correlate with revenue growth for small caps, further enhancing their investment appeal next year. Kaynor noted that Wall Street analysts predict a substantial rebound in earnings for small caps beginning in late 2024, with expectations that their growth will outpace large caps throughout most of 2025. Story Continues A close-up of a laboratory technician in a laboratory, measuring a newly developed biopharmaceutical drug. Our Methodology To curate the list of the 12 best long-term penny stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we used the Finviz stock screener and Seeking Alpha. Using the screener we got an initial list of penny stocks (trading under $5) with more than 20% 5-year sales growth. Next, we cross-checked each stock for 5-year sales growth from Seeking Alpha. Lastly, we ranked these stocks based on the number of hedge fund holders sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q3 2024 hedge funds database.

Geron Corporation (NASDAQ: GERN ) Stock Price: $3.54 5-Year Sales Growth: 113.54% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29 Geron Corporation (NASDAQ:GERN) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative treatments for blood cancers. Its flagship product, RYTELO, is a first-in-class telomerase inhibitor that has received FDA approval for treating certain adult patients suffering from lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (LR-MDS) with transfusion-dependent anemia. This approval marks it as the only company with an oligonucleotide telomerase inhibitor available in the United States. During the fiscal third quarter of 2024, Geron Corporation (NASDAQ:GERN) reported a net product revenue of $28.2 million from RYTELO, marking a successful first full quarter since its launch. As another important highlight for the quarter, management completed financing transactions to bolster its cash position. This included a synthetic royalty agreement with Royalty Pharma, providing $125 million in exchange for tiered royalty payments, and a 5-year senior term loan agreement with Pharmakon for up to $250 million. After its successful launch in the US, management is waiting for the review of RYTELO's MAA in lower-risk MDS by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). If the regulatory approval is granted it plans to launch RYTELO in select EU markets starting in 2026. Overall, GERN ranks first on our list of best long-term penny stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of GERN to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NASDAQ:GERN) Crashed Today Angelica Ballesteros Tue, Jan 7, 2025, 5:20 AM 2 min read In This Article: 002722.SZ -0.97% We recently compiled a list of the 10 Firms Mirror Dow Jones Decline on Monday . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Geron Corp. (NASDAQ:GERN) stands against the other stocks. Ten companies kicked off this week's trading mirroring a decline on Dow Jones with a series of catalysts dampening investor sentiment. In this article, let\u2019s explore the reasons behind their decline. To come up with Monday's top losers, we considered only the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. A close-up of a laboratory technician in a laboratory, measuring a newly developed biopharmaceutical drug. Geron Corp. (NASDAQ:GERN) Shares of Geron Corp. decreased by 3.92 percent on Monday to finish the day at $3.43 apiece as investors remained on the sidelines for further developments from the company. Earlier, the company reported net loss in the third quarter and the first nine months of the year. Albeit a lower net loss in the third quarter, its first nine months registered a higher loss of $149.2 million as compared with the $132.2 million registered year-on-year. Investors are also waiting on the sidelines for any updates on its drug Rytelo, which aims to treat specific types of myelodysplastic syndromes. The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) already recommended the drug for approval to the European Commission, which will review the recommendation. A final decision on market authorization is expected in the coming months. Overall GERN ranks 7th on our list of the stocks that crashed today. While we acknowledge the potential of GERN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GERN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock .

Best Penny Stock to Buy for 2025? Neha Gupta Wed, Jan 1, 2025, 2:58 PM 5 min read In This Article: 002722.SZ -0.97% ^GSPC -0.76% We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Penny Stocks to Buy for 2025 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Geron Corporation (NASDAQ:GERN) stands against the other penny stocks. The US stock market has been on a roll owing to a powerful rally in the technology sector. The S&P 500 has gained more than 23%, driven by gains in mega-cap stocks amid the artificial intelligence frenzy. Likewise, the gains have come amid a resilient US economy that has steered clear of recession. Improving monetary policy outlook on the US Federal Reserve cutting interest rate has also strengthened investor sentiments on equities. While small-cap stocks have lagged behind the overall market, they are drawing special attention as most appear to be trading at highly discounted valuations. Often considered speculative investments due to their low price point and smaller market presence, penny stocks are turning out to be attractive investment plays heading into 2025.

According to VettaFi\u2019s Todd Rosenbluth, 2025 could be the year for small-cap stocks that have lagged the overall market but are backed by solid underlying fundamentals. \u201cSmall caps are going to become more in favor in 2025,\u201d Rosenbluth said on CNBC\u2019s \u201cETF Edge\u201d. \u201cThey started to perk up since the election and are heading into the election as interest rates have been coming down.\u201d There is an increased focus on the best penny stocks to buy for 2025, as most are trading at discounted valuations. The discounted valuations come as the Russell 2000 is only up 11% for the year compared to a 23% gain for the S&P 500. The fact that penny stocks offer the potential for long-term capital appreciations supported by durable profit growth affirms why they are solid long-term plays. Fundstrat Global Advisors' managing partner, Tom Lee, has already reiterated that small-cap stocks are trading at a discount with a medium price-to-earnings multiple of 10. \u201cSince 1987, small caps have traded on a medium P/E basis to a premium of the S&P 500. The S&P is at 17 times. I think small caps could in the next couple of years outperform by more than 100%,\u201d Lee said in an interview with CNBC. New Street Advisors CEO Delano Saporu shares similar sentiments; he believes small-cap stocks are well poised to outperform in 2025, having underperformed over the past year. Ever since Donald Trump won the election, penny stocks have advanced amid growing enthusiasm around the potential easing of regulations on businesses. Story Continues Profit taking in the magnificent seven stocks and other large-cap stocks on a roll is expected to benefit penny stocks. In addition, the outlook for penny stocks remains solid as investors rotate out of money market accounts as the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates as part of the easing policy spree. Amid the profit-taking spree, the best penny stock to buy for 2025 should offer a way of diversifying an investment portfolio.

Corporation (GERN) Among the Best Biotech Penny Stocks to Invest in Now? Mashaid Ahmed Tue, Dec 31, 2024, 8:54 PM 6 min read In This Article: 002722.SZ -0.97% We recently published a list of the 12 Best Biotech Penny Stocks To Invest In Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Geron Corporation (NASDAQ: GERN ) stands against the other best biotech penny stocks to invest in now. Goldman Sachs has spotlighted an often-overlooked sector poised to benefit from lower borrowing costs: biotechnology stocks. In a recent note to clients, John Flood, Goldman\u2019s Head of Americas Equities Sales Trading, highlighted biotech as an under-the-radar opportunity for those seeking to capitalize on the Fed\u2019s rate cuts. Flood noted that biotechnology stocks are uniquely sensitive to changes in interest rates as they often rely on projected future profits and are heavily impacted by the cost of capital. With little or no current profitability but significant upside potential, if clinical trials succeed, these stocks have an \u201coption-like structure\u201d that makes them particularly responsive to interest rate movements. The note also emphasized that biotech has recently seen improved fundamentals driven by positive clinical outcomes and a more favorable regulatory environment. Despite these tailwinds, biotech remains under-owned by hedge funds. According to Goldman\u2019s data, the sector ranks in the 13th percentile in hedge fund long/short positioning over the past year and just the 4th percentile over the past five years. Recent performance data supports Goldman\u2019s outlook. The iShares Biotech ETF climbed 7.7% in Q3, outperforming the Nasdaq Biotech Index and more than doubling the S&P 500\u2019s 3.2% gain over the same period. For investors anticipating a continued decline in bond yields, Goldman suggests biotechnology stocks may offer more attractive exposure compared to other rate-sensitive equity sectors, which are more dependent on broader economic growth trends. READ ALSO: 12 Best Technology Penny Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds and 12 Best Energy Stocks To Invest In Now . Biotech Innovations: Small Caps Lead the Way In an interview with Yahoo Finance on October 30, Stacey Sears, Portfolio Manager at Emerald Advisers, provided a comprehensive overview of the current landscape and investment opportunities in small and emerging biotechnology companies. Sears acknowledged that there has been a significant innovation in the healthcare industry, especially over the past 20 to 30 years, which was catalyzed after the decoding of the human genome in 2003, as it identified over 8,000 genetic diseases. This breakthrough provided a roadmap for researchers and scientists, leading to accelerated innovation in areas such as DNA and RNA editing and the development of treatments for orphan and rare diseases. Story Continues Sears noted that small and emerging biotechnology companies have been at the forefront of this innovation. In 2023, approximately two-thirds of all clinical trials were initiated by small and emerging biotechnology firms, and about 56% of new drug substances approved by regulatory bodies originated from these smaller companies. Sears pointed out that the sector has been underperforming over the past couple of years. This underperformance is largely due to the inverse correlation between healthcare stocks and interest rates and yields. However, she noted that the sector is now starting to see a favorable shift. Clinical advancements have continued unabated, and the pipeline of new treatments and drugs remains robust. Large pharmaceutical companies are facing a patent cliff, estimated to be around $30 billion by the end of this decade as their drugs become generic. Small and emerging biotechnology companies are seen as key sources for filling this pipeline. This situation is creating a potential M&A tailwind, as larger companies look to acquire innovative smaller firms to bolster their drug pipelines. The biotechnology sector presents a unique investment opportunity, driven by favorable interest rates, ongoing clinical advancements, and increased M&A activity. Small and emerging biotech firms, in particular, are poised to play a critical role in addressing unmet medical needs and fueling innovation in the healthcare space.

A close-up of a laboratory technician in a laboratory, measuring a newly developed biopharmaceutical drug. Geron Corp. (NASDAQ:GERN) Biotechnology company Geron Corp. (GERN) saw its share price increase by 1.52 percent on Friday to end at $3.35 apiece. Investors resorted to bargain hunting following a drop in its valuation on Thursday. Albeit booking a lower net loss in the third quarter of the year, the company reported last month that net loss in the first nine months of the year was higher at $149.2 million as compared with the $132.2 million registered year-on-year. Geron (GERN) recently announced that the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has recommended approval of its drug Rytelo for treating specific types of myelodysplastic syndromes. The European Commission will now review this recommendation, with a final decision on market authorization expected in the coming months. Overall GERN ranks 4th on our list of the firms that ended the trading week defying market bloodbath.

(GERN) the Biggest Loser of This Week? Angelica Ballesteros Thu, Dec 26, 2024, 4:17 PM 2 min read In This Article: 002722.SZ -0.97% We recently compiled a list of the 10 Biggest Losers of This Week . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Geron Corp. (NASDAQ:GERN) stands against the other stocks. Wall Street's main indices all finished in the green during a shortened trading session this week, yet 10 companies--mainly technology stocks-- still booked significant losses in their valuations. Let's take a look at the extent of each company's losses and the potential factors that could have dampened investor sentiment. To come up with the biggest losers this week, we considered only the stocks that have at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. A close-up of a laboratory technician in a laboratory, measuring a newly developed biopharmaceutical drug. Geron Corp. (NASDAQ:GERN) Geron Corp. (GERN) saw its shares drop by 4.3 percent to $3.34 from $3.49 apiece. Geron (GERN) is a biopharmaceutical company. Geron recently announced that the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has recommended approval of its drug Rytelo for treating specific types of myelodysplastic syndromes. The European Commission will now review this recommendation, with a final decision on market authorization expected in the coming months. According to analysts, the company continues to ingest news of the company\u2019s earnings performance, with the firm still booking a net loss in the third quarter of the year\u2014$26.4 million, albeit lower than the $44.8 million reported in the same period last year. However, the first nine months of the year saw a higher net loss of $149.2 million as compared with the $132.2 million registered year-on-year. Overall GERN ranks 5th on our list of the biggest losers of this week. While we acknowledge the potential of GERN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GERN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock .

If you\u2019re worried you\u2019ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it\u2019s too late.

See 3 \u201cDouble Down\u201d stocks \u00bb *Stock Advisor returns as of November 4, 2024 Before we begin, please note that during the course of this presentation and question-and-answer session, we will be making forward-looking statements regarding future events, performance, plans, expectations, and other projections, including those relating to the launch, commercial opportunity, and therapeutic potential of Rytelo, anticipated clinical and commercial events and related timelines, the sufficiency of Geron's financial resources and other statements that are not historical facts. Actual events or results could differ materially. Therefore, I refer you to the discussion under the heading Risk Factors in Geron's most recent periodic report filed with the SEC, which identifies important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements and our future updates to those risk factors. Geron undertakes no duty or obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Story Continues With that, I'll turn the call over to Chip. Chip? Chip Scarlett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Aaron. Good morning to everybody on the call. Thanks for joining us today. Following FDA approval and the commercial launch of Rytelo, our first-in-class telomerase inhibitor, this has been a transformative year for Geron. As a result, we believe we're well-positioned to build long-term commercial value with this product. In our first full quarter on the market in the United States, we achieved $28.2 million in Rytelo net product revenue, which exceeded our expectations. The initial quarter of product revenue speaks to our execution as a commercial company, as well as the high unmet need in lower-risk MDS and the compelling value proposition of Rytelo for hematologists and patients. This gives us confidence in future continued demand and momentum for Rytelo. Our strong IP position underlies the long-term commercial value proposition for Rytelo. We believe this IP position, including specific claims in our patents covering the indication that's in our FDA label and buttressed by the FDA's grant of orphan drug exclusivity for lower-risk MDS into June of 2031, will provide exclusivity in the United States through August of 2037. Today, our primary focus is on continuing to deliver on the initial success we achieved in the third quarter, getting Rytelo to more eligible lower-risk MDS patients, and maximizing our opportunity in the U.S. market. In Europe, we believe that the CHMP review of our Rytelo marketing authorization application in lower-risk MDS could be completed in late 2024 or early 2025, with potential EU approval in the first half of 2025. Subject to receiving this approval, we're continuing to prepare for the potential launch of Rytelo in the EU and are planning to commercialize Rytelo in select EU markets beginning in 2026. As all of you know, Jim Ziegler joined us as chief commercial officer in early September. Jim hit the ground running, and on this call, we'll provide more color on the Q3 U.S. Commercial launch performance, key imperatives for our continued success and our next steps in preparing for potential EU commercialization. In addition to this quarter's strong commercial performance, we were pleased to announce this morning a completion of both the synthetic royalty transaction and a debt financing transaction that together generated $250 million in gross proceeds. These transactions were comprised of $125 million capped synthetic royalty with Royalty Pharma and a $250 million committed senior secured debt facility with funds managed by Pharmakon Advisors, under which we've borrowed $125 million allowing us to retire existing debt. With this new debt facility, we also have access to an additional $125 million. We believe that the favorable terms we achieved in these transactions reflect the significant commercial potential of Rytelo and coming off a successful Q1 of commercial launch, provide us with critical flexibility to fuel continued growth and investment in our future. Michelle will provide more details on these transactions and on our Q3 results later on this call. Let's move on to our commercial development programs. Starting with our pivotal imetelstat phase 3 IMpactMF trial and JAK inhibitor relapsed/refractory myelofibrosis. This trial was approximately 70% enrolled as of August 2024. Based on the most recent planning assumptions for enrollment and death rates in the trial, we continue to expect an interim analysis in early 2026 as well as a final analysis in early '27. As the first myelofibrosis phase 3 trial with overall survival is the primary endpoint, we believe that if the trial is positive imetelstat could transform the treatment landscape from this high unmet need patient population with dismal survival, representing a substantial commercial opportunity. In addition to IMpactMF, we are exploring the potential of imetelstat across multiple different myeloid hematologic malignancies, which were highlighted in ASH abstracts that were released earlier this week. Faye will speak to the new data and to our earlier clinical programs later in the call. Finally, I'd like to highlight the very significant contributions from our colleagues across the company in these first four months of our launch. They executed against our key business objectives with focus and a sense of urgency to deliver Rytelo to the patients we're committed to help. We deeply appreciate this commitment, as we continue our evolution as a commercial company looking forward to the future. With that, I'll hand the call over to Jim for a commercial update. Jim? Jim Ziegler -- Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer Thank you, Chip, and good morning, everyone. I am honored to join Geron at this important time for the company. With the U.S. launch of Rytelo, we have an exciting opportunity to improve the lives of patients with lower-risk MDS, with transfusion-dependent anemia. As Chip highlighted, we achieved $28.2 million in Rytelo net product revenues in our first full quarter of U.S. sales. In the first few months of launch, demand has increased month-over-month with Q3 performance exceeding our expectations. Demand from launch through Q3 has come from 388 ordering centers, which represents approximately 45% of our key targeted accounts. This strong start reinforces the high unmet need in Rytelo's clinical profile in first-line ESA ineligible and second-line plus lower-risk MDS. Our market research indicates treating physicians appreciate Rytelo's differentiated clinical profile in 24-week and one-year red blood cell transfusion independent rates, median duration of red blood cell transfusion independence and hemoglobin rise. We believe Rytelo's strong clinical data support broad utilization across treatment eligible patient sub-groups in both community and academic settings. Patient access is also critical for adoption and update, and we have achieved significant payer coverage since approval. Payers responsible for approximately 70% of U.S. covered lives have implemented medical coverage policies for Rytelo that are consistent with its FDA label, clinical trials and/or NCCN guidelines. Additionally, our Permanent J-code was issued in October 2024 and becomes effective on 1st January 2025. We believe the Permanent J-code will streamline billing and reimbursement for centers treating patients with Rytelo. I also want to acknowledge questions from investors regarding the trajectory of weekly Rytelo sales as reflected in third-party claims data. We believe that, while these claims data may reflect trends and demand that are directionally consistent with what we see internally, there are caveats around this data, when we compare them to our own insights, including incomplete weekly data capture. Also, we remain in the early stages of launch and continue to expect week-to-week fluctuations regardless of the source of sales data. We believe, HCPs will continue to utilize Rytelo based on our strong label and NCCN guidelines, positive payer coverage, observations from the field, and ongoing market research including chart reviews. To deliver steady growth, we must execute on several key imperatives, including driving new patients across all eligible segments, particularly in second line, reinforcing the value of an appropriate duration of treatment with HCPs, educating HCPs on appropriate cytopenia management and leveraging strong payer access supported by the NCCN guideline and the newly approved J-code. From our own internal demand sales data, so far the Rytelo sales growth trajectory in the Q4 continues to be promising. Overall, we remain confident in our launch progress to date, continued demand for Rytelo, expected momentum into 2025, and the projected long-term growth of the brand. Our No. 1 commercial priority is to deliver a strong U.S. launch. We are committed to keeping laser focused on that objective. We plan to leverage our U.S. launch experience to also prepare for commercialization in select EU countries in 2026 and beyond. Our goal in Europe is to optimize patient access and revenues for imetelstat in prioritized countries. As Chip mentioned, subject to receiving regulatory approval, we are preparing to commercialize Rytelo in select EU countries in 2026. This includes working with experienced third parties who can provide contracted services including essential critical path activities such as reimbursement, HTA assessments, market access, and distribution. In summary, I want to acknowledge the dedicated cross functional teams at Geron for all their hard work to ensure that eligible U.S. patients have broad and timely access to Rytelo. I am inspired by how we have remained focused during this time of transition and I am optimistic in the future. We are very pleased with the strong demand for Rytelo across community and academic settings, favorable payer coverage policies, and broad utilization across patient segments. These early launch dynamics reinforce our expectations for continued demand and promising growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Michelle for a financial update. Michelle? Michelle Robertson -- Executive Vice President, Finance, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For detailed Q3 2024 financial results, please refer to the press release we issued this morning, which is available on our website. We are pleased with our commercial performance this quarter and with securing the synthetic royalty and debt financing announced this morning. I'll bring your attention to key Q3 financial results and then discuss the new royalty and senior term loan agreement. As of September 30th, 2024, we had approximately $378.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities on a pro forma basis including gross proceeds from the upfront payment under the Royalty Pharma agreement and the first tranche of the Pharmakon loan and after repayment of our existing debt, we had approximately $542.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024. Total product revenue net for the three and nine months ended September 30th was $28.2 million and $29 million respectively. Total net revenue for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $28.3 million and $29.5 million respectively, compared to $164,000 and $214,000 for the same period in 2023. The increase in revenue is due to product revenue from U.S. sales of Rytelo, which was available for prescribers to order from specialty distributors as of June 27th, 2024. Total operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, were $56.5 million and $183.1 million respectively, compared to $47.8 million and $139.9 million for the same period in 2023. Cost of goods sold was approximately $450,000 and $473,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30th, 2024 respectively, which consisted of cost to manufacture and distribute Rytelo. Research and development expenses for the three months and nine months ended September 30th, 2024 were $20.2 million and $80.3 million respectively, and $29.4 million and $92.1 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily due to manufacturing and quality costs that were capitalized in the current period due to FDA approval of Rytelo compared to being expensed in the prior period. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30th, 2024 were $35.9 million and $102.4 million respectively, and $18.4 million and $47.7 million for the same periods in 2023. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily reflects higher commercial launch expenses, increases in headcount and related expenses in connection with the U.S. launch of Rytelo. For fiscal year 2024, we expect total operating expenses to be in the range of approximately $260 million to $270 million. Finally, we are pleased to announce this morning the closing of synthetic royalty and debt financing with two exceptional long-term partners, Royalty Pharma and Pharmakon Advisors that provide us with access up to $375 million in capital, of which we have received $250 million in gross proceeds. For a detailed overview of the terms of these financing, please review the press release and the Form 8-K we issued this morning available on our website. These financing strengthen our cash position and further solidify our balance sheet. It provide flexibility to invest in our future and reduce considerably our dependence on the equity capital markets. First, we have entered into a synthetic royalty agreement with Royalty Pharma, which we believe prioritizes cost of capital and maximizes operating flexibility. Importantly, our royalties to Royalty Pharma are capped at 1.65x the closing payment of $125 million, if Royalty Pharma receives that amount by June 30, 2031 or at two times after that date. In other words, we retain all sales after the hard cap is reached. Our royalty payments will be 7.75% of net annual U.S. sales of Rytelo up to $500 million dropping to 3% for sales between $500 million and $1 billion and 1% over $1 billion, which we believe are competitive terms for a capped royalty agreement. Additionally, the agreement allows for optional prepayment of the royalties upon a change in control. We believe, this royalty agreement is a very clean and flexible structure with no-maturity date, mandatory repayments or economic ratchets. In addition to the transaction with Royalty Pharma, we have entered into a five-year senior secured term loan with funds managed by Pharmakon Advisors for up to $250 million. At closing, we drew $125 million under this loan, of which we used $86.5 million to fully repay our existing loan with Hercules and Silicon Valley Bank, which has now been terminated. We have the ability to draw another $125 million by the end of 2025, of which $75 million will be available at our option and the remaining $50 million available at our option subject to reaching a specified revenue threshold. The facility contains no scheduled amortization payments with all outstanding principal due at maturity in 2029, and there are no financial covenants. The loan bears interest at a variable rate per year equals 5.75% plus the three-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate or SOFR, subject to a SOFR floor of 3%. We are very pleased with the completion of these non-equity financing transactions on favorable terms. Based on our current operating plans and assumptions, we believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including the upfront payments received under these agreements and the anticipated revenues from U.S. sales of Rytelo will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12-months from today, allowing us to continue supporting commercial launch of Rytelo in the U.S. and potential launch in the EU, complete the phase 3 IMpactMF trial and relapsed/refractory MF, invest in supply chain redundancy for Rytelo and fund our general working capital requirements. We believe there are scenarios where these financing can take us to profitability without raising future equity capital. Overall, we believe we are in a very strong capital position to fuel continued growth of U.S. sales and support critical value drivers for our business. With that, I'll turn the call over to Faye for a medical and clinical update. Faye? Faye Feller -- Executive Vice President, Chief Medical Officer Thanks, Michelle. And hello, everyone. I'd like to start by sharing how meaningful it has been for me and my entire team to hear feedback about the impact of Rytelo in the commercial setting. This further motivates our team to develop and deliver imetelstat for patients with myeloid hematologic malignancies. The field medical team has been responding to information requests that support HCPs as they use Rytelo in the commercial setting, in particular around education on cytopenia management and sequencing with other lower-risk MDS treatment. Today, I will focus on our ASH abstracts released earlier this week, which we believe continue to highlight telomerase inhibition with imetelstat as an important and powerful approach to treating myeloid hematologic malignancies. For detailed information on the data abstract, please view the press release we issued on Tuesday, available on our website or visit the ASH website to view the abstract. First, I will cover new analyses in the IMerge clinical trial, suggesting that imetelstat demonstrates clinical activity in patients with lower-risk MDS with transfusion dependent anemia, regardless of cryotherapy. Abstract 352, accepted as an oral presentation, pooled thea from IMerge phase 2, phase 3, and the QTc substudy and evaluates the effect of prior treatment, including ESAs, luspatercept, lenalidomide and HMA on the clinical activity across these patients. Although we have small numbers in some cases and limited data on outcomes in later lines of treatment, we believe these data have important clinical implications suggesting that these patients experience an RBC transfusion related clinical benefit and improvements in hemoglobin with imetelstat, regardless of their prior treatment history. Abstract 4590, accepted as a poster presentation, reports the first efficacy and safety results from the ventricular repolarization IMerge QTc substudy conducted per FDA guidance. As of the data cutoff on May 10, 2024, no clinically meaningful effects of imetelstat on cardiac repolarization or other ECG parameters were observed and no new safety signals emerged. In this QTc substudy, efficacy and safety of imetelstat were comparable to that shown in the overall population of the IMerge phase 3 trial. And notably, response to imetelstat were seen in patients receiving prior treatments, including luspatercept, lenalidomide, and HMA. The third, IMerge Abstract 3210, accepted as a poster presentation, reports on post hoc analyses of the patient-reported outcomes, or PRO, population as assessed by validated measures, the functional assessment of chronic illness therapy or facet fatigue, functional assessment of cancer therapy anemia or FACT-An, and the Quality of Life in Myelodysplasia Scale or QUALMS questionnaires. The sustained improvement in fatigue and maintenance of quality of life and anemia symptoms within the telstat shown in these analyses are meaningful and very encouraging as we aim to improve outcomes for these patients. Abstract 998, accepted as an oral presentation, reports the first safety results from the dose escalation Part 1 of the phase 1 IMproveMF clinical trial, in which 13 patients were enrolled as of July 10, 2024. At least three patients received each dose level of imetelstat and doses of ruxolitinib were individualized per patient. No dose limiting toxicities were observed and adverse events were consistent with those observed in other clinical trials of imetelstat. The pharmacokinetic profiles of imetelstat and ruxolitinib in this combination study was similar to previous monotherapy studies. These early results support the potential tolerability of imetelstat as a combination therapy and could inform our future development efforts. Also with regards to IMproveMF, based on the study's safety evaluation team review of the dose finding data from Part 1 of the study, we adopted the best unanimous recommendation and progressed the Part 2 of the study, which is designed to confirm the safety profile of imetelstat 9.4 milligram per kilogram in combination with ruxolitinib. Abstract 3222 submitted by Geron collaborators and accepted as a poster presentation, provides an interim analysis from the phase 2 IMpress trial, evaluating imetelstat in patients with high risk MDS or AML, refractory relapsing or intolerance to either azacitidine or decitabine or venetoclax plus azacitidine. In the first part of the trial, none of the six high risk MDS or 17 AML treated patients reached the primary endpoint visit, which was scheduled after four cycles of treatment. Short-term transient improvement in hematological value was observed in individual cases. In patients on the lower-risk MDS dosing schedule of every four weeks, imetelstat showed some anti-proliferative effects, including a decline in blasts and leukocytes. Overall, no new safety signals occurred beyond those already known for imetelstat. Based on the observations in this first cohort, the protocol was amended to a more frequent dosing schedule for a second cohort of patients that is now being enrolled and treated with a modified schedule, starting in August 2024. Lastly, Abstract 52, submitted by Geron Collaborators and accepted as an oral presentation, shares preclinical data identifying imetelstat mediated keratosis associated lipidomic alterations in AML cells that correlate with imetelstat treatment responses in vivo. These mechanistic insights may be leveraged to develop and optimize therapeutic strategies using the imetelstat to target venetoclax in cytosine resistant AML subclones. I look forward to keeping you updated on our clinical development progress. And I will now turn the call back over to Chip. Chip Scarlett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Fay. To close, we're obviously very pleased with this quarter's performance and the feedback we're receiving from customers and payers. We're confident in our launch trajectory and opportunity for long-term growth, while recognizing we're only four months into this launch. We have conviction that Rytelo can become part of the standard-of-care for eligible patients in this high unmet-need, lower-risk MDS treatment paradigm and that it can bring differentiated benefits to patients both in the U.S. And subject to regulatory approval in the EU. In addition to lower-risk MDS, we're also looking forward to the readout of our pivotal phase 3 IMpactMF trial in relapsed/refractory MF. We believe that approval of Rytelo in lower-risk MDS in the EU and a positive outcome in this MF trial are key milestones that could contribute very significantly to the commercial value proposition for Rytelo in the future. We'll now open the line for questions. Operator? Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tara Bancroft with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Tara Bancroft -- TD Cowen -- Analyst Hi. Good morning and congrats on the great quarter. So given what you have seen this quarter, we were hoping you could give us a better idea of how you think growth cadence could look over the next few quarters or over the next year. But I'm especially curious how your growth assumptions and even the ultimate market for Rytelo factored into the terms of the royalty deal? Chip Scarlett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tara, this is Chip. Could you explain a little bit more what you mean by what factored into the royalty due just for the royalty [Inaudible] Tara Bancroft -- TD Cowen -- Analyst Like, when you were negotiating the deal, how were your assumptions for the ultimate market and or growth over the next couple of years kind of factored into that? Chip Scarlett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. Michelle, would you like to take that? Michelle Robertson -- Executive Vice President, Finance, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer Sure. Well, I think Jim why don't we have Jim answer her first question, which is just about how we're thinking about growth over the coming quarters, and then I can comment on the structure. Jim Ziegler -- Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer OK. Good morning, Tara. Jim Ziegler here. So what we're looking at is and expecting is steady consistent growth across all of the patient segments, specifically second line, in both, RS negative and RS positive, first line ESA ineligible, and then, of course, the relapsed refractory third line plus patients. We're not giving guidance at this point, but we are expecting steady and consistent growth going forward. Michelle Robertson -- Executive Vice President, Finance, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer And I'll take the second one. First of all, I just want to say that this was an extremely competitive process, and we're very happy with the outcome. We used our current internal forecast and, to determine, and negotiate the terms, which we, which we're very, again, just very pleased with. Tara Bancroft -- TD Cowen -- Analyst OK. Thanks so much. Operator Your next question is from Faisal Khurshid with Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Faisal Khurshid -- Leerink Partners -- Analyst Hey, guys. Just two questions, if you don't mind. 1st, just on the royalty percentage rates. Can you just clarify sort of how you think investors should be thinking about the royalty rate as well as the kind of cap multiplier on that? I think the rate seems like it starts out a little bit higher than your typical royalty deals then kind of comes lower. And then if you could just clarify your cash runway expectations? Michelle Robertson -- Executive Vice President, Finance, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer So I mean, I'm not going to comment on other transactions that have been done with Royalty Pharma. Again, very competitive. We're very happy that it is a capped royalty deal at the 1.65. It's achieved, by a certain date. And so we think that the rate is competitive, from what we've seen. But, again, I think that our focus, is on that cap of 1.65. And based on our current plans and meeting our internal revenue projections, we feel pretty confident, that we can reach that, prior to peak sales. Faisal Khurshid -- Leerink Partners -- Analyst Got it. Understood. Michelle Robertson -- Executive Vice President, Finance, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer On the cash runway, as I mentioned in my script, there are scenarios, where we feel that these two transactions, can take us to breakeven. Again, based on our current plan, that would mean meeting our internal revenue, our opex projections over the next several years. We feel that, we could reach breakeven without needing additional equity financing. One of our goals of these transactions was to not fall below 12 months of cash, as I said in Q2. Just to clarify, these two transactions allow us to maintain 12 months of cash going forward, again, based on our current revenue expectations, and opex projections. So we're not saying, we have 12 months of cash, because I know previously we talked about cash into Q2 of 2026. What we're saying is that, we can maintain that 12 months of cash, which has always been one of our goals not to fall below 12 months. Faisal Khurshid -- Leerink Partners -- Analyst Yes. It makes sense. And then just to clarify your comments, so you're saying that your kind of internal assumptions are that you kind of tripped the multiple on like on the earlier side? Michelle Robertson -- Executive Vice President, Finance, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer Yes. If we meet our current internal revenue projections, yes. Faisal Khurshid -- Leerink Partners -- Analyst Sounds good. Thank you. Operator Your next question is from Corinne Johnson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Corinne Johnson -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Hey. Thanks. Good morning. You did mention that you expect to see kind of steady growth over the coming quarters. But could you clarify a little bit about what that means to you? Is that in terms of like absolute number of patient growth or the growth rate? Just a little clarification would be helpful there. And then, in terms of the patients that you're seeing come on to therapy, are these primarily second-line or third-line patients? And what portion of them have previously seen Revlimid at this stage? Chip Scarlett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Go ahead, Jim. Jim Ziegler -- Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer Hi, Corinne. This is Jim Ziegler. Again, we're not providing guidance, but in terms of our growth, what we expect is growth across all patient segments in both the academic and community setting. And what we provided on this earnings call is that, 388 of our targeted accounts have ordered. So that's the breadth. Over time, what we're expecting is, obviously to increase the breadth and depth of prescriptions, our prescribing, Rytelo for patients across these accounts. So I'll just reinforce that we're seeing, uptake in utilization across all patient segments, including first-line ESA ineligible, second line and then third-line patients at this point. Corinne Johnson -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst OK. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is open. Carter Gould -- Analyst Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. May I start off just one or two housekeeping questions? Can you spell out any impacts from inventory in the quarter, and as well as you're providing patient starts numbers? That would be helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up on the prior question. The breadth of centers with ordering is impressive. I guess what I'm -- but I guess with our back of the envelope math it does suggest that, the depth of prescribing is still very much in its early stages. Can you talk a little bit about what this implies around how centers are sort of experimenting with the product and then adopting and maybe if that argues against bolus and any commentary there would be helpful? Jim Ziegler -- Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer Great. Thanks, Carter. Jim Ziegler again. So in terms of inventory, typically in buy and bill what we see is between two and four weeks of inventory and we're right in that range. So that's consistent with what we would expect. In terms of the breadth and depth questions, we're still relatively early in launch. This is our first full quarter. And so, your observations are correct. Early on, we're seeing the breadth, physicians are getting experience. And then over time, we expect to see depth in these accounts and continued breadth going forward. In terms of bolus, the way we think about it is, there's still a high unmet need, Rytelo gives patients another treatment option. We expect consistent steady growth. We within Geron did not model a bolus. We expected steady and consistent growth. And early in launch, that's what we're seeing. Carter Gould -- Analyst And the patient start number, are you guys providing that? Jim Ziegler -- Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer Yeah. I'm not, as you know, Carter, on the patient starts, in the buy and bill market, we don't get that hard data, in the way you might with other markets. So the way to think about it is if you take the total milligrams that were sold divided by your assumption on average patient wait times 7.1 starting dose, that would give you the range of patients. But it doesn't account for specifically is new patients versus continuing patients or dose interruptions or, dose reductions. So that's why we're not gonna give that going forward because it's not a clean number, it's a calculated number. Carter Gould -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Your next question is from Emily Bodnar with H.C. Wainwright. Your line is open. Emily Bodnar -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on a good quarter. I guess maybe if you can discuss some of the initial real world experience in terms of benefit on transfusion reductions and also on the safety profile. Are you kind of seeing the data in line with the IMerge study? And then curious how luspatercept kind of transitioning more into the first line setting has, impacted the launch, if at all, and if you're seeing more patients previously treated with luspatercept in the first line? Jim Ziegler -- Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer Hi. It's Jim again. I'll take the first part of the question and maybe Faye can also jump in. It's still relatively early in launch and, much of the insights that we get are from the field and from, market research like our patient chart audits. What I would share right now is that, performance and real world sort of experiences are consistent with clinical trials. But again, it's still relatively early on, in launch. And then in terms of, luspatercept in the first line, yes. Based upon their label and the commands, I expect that trial that they will, compete and, compete for that first-line patient against ESA as you know, and regardless of whether that first-line patient, is on ESA or luspatercept, we expect that our differentiated product profile will allow us to become standard of care in second line and we still have that first line ESA ineligible patient population, which is about 10% that, we expect to, compete for as well. Faye Feller -- Executive Vice President, Chief Medical Officer Yes. And -- Hi this is Faye. Just to add and reinforce what Jim was saying. It's still early, but anecdotally, what we are hearing from the field is that, this the community of providers are comfortable managing, these cytopenias and are -- it's -- overall enthusiastic and excited to use, Rytelo for their and have this option for their patients. Emily Bodnar -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator Your next question is from Stephen Willey with Stifel. Your line is open. Stephen Willey -- Analyst Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on the progress. I was wondering if you could just maybe talk a little bit about the split that you're seeing. I know, it's early in terms of data that you guys are getting, but just in terms of the utilization split between academics and community prescribers. And then, you mentioned your review of chart audits, in terms of informing how current utilization trends are looking. Can you talk about just how the dose management, to address the cytopenias that occurred typically during the first few cycles is playing out, in the real world data, just relative to IMerge. And then I just have a follow-up for Michelle. Jim Ziegler -- Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer Sure. Hi, Steven. Jim Ziegler again. The split between community and academic is 65/35 or roughly two-thirds, one-third. And then right now, what we're hearing from our physicians in both field observations as well as our market research is that, cytopenia management is well understood. There aren't major concerns. I would expect that, the real world cytopenia management is at least as good as it is in the clinical trials. We have a lot of personal, non-personal efforts to help support appropriate cytopenia management associated with Rytelo. Stephen Willey -- Analyst OK. And then, maybe for Michelle. I know you've kind of given kind of longer-term gross to net guidance in the mid-teens range. Just curious if you could give us a gross-to-net number for the quarter. And then also, obviously, the royalty transaction will impact cost of goods going forward, but just curious, if you can kind of give us, a steady state cost of goods assumption that, excludes the impact of the royalty. Michelle Robertson -- Executive Vice President, Finance, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer Yes, sure. So we have continued to guide on the gross-to-net in kind of the mid-double-digits, and that's what it was that's what we ended in the third quarter. I believe it was -- you can do the math, around 14%. So we expect that to slightly go up as we -- the volume increases, and we review the mix, the 340B mix. But we continue to guide on the mid double-digits. And then, on COGS, I mean, obviously, we're not guiding on specific COGS. But, once we get out of sort of this inventory that had already been expensed, we anticipate our fully loaded COGS to be mid-single-digits going forward. Stephen Willey -- Analyst All right, very helpful. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator Next question is from Kalpit Patel with B. Riley Securities. Kalpit Patel -- B. Riley Financial -- Analyst Yes. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Maybe first for Michelle, I guess, can you elaborate on why the royalty and debt structure was chosen over maybe a simpler equity raise, especially given the current market cap of the company? What specific considerations made this approach more preferable? Michelle Robertson -- Executive Vice President, Finance, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer So again, the transaction, this is a result of an extremely competitive process. We had options across both debt and royalty structures and those ranged in various sizes and terms. Based on the terms that were available to us, we thought carefully about how much debt to take on so that we could pay-off our current debt that we have with Hercules, SVB that had unfavorable terms, which we did pay-off, once we received the funds from Pharmakon. And then just the amount of sales to retain in the early launch period and we felt that this struck the right balance. And again, this reduces our dependency on the equity markets, which was a goal of ours was to not further dilute the stock. Kalpit Patel -- B. Riley Financial -- Analyst OK. Got it. And then maybe in the data that you're seeing so far, do we have an early sense of what the month-over-month adherence rates or continuation rates are for these patients who started treatment? How consistent is that with the clinical trials? Jim Ziegler -- Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer Hi, Kalpit, this is Jim again. It's still relatively early. I'm not comfortable given any data at this point, but obviously it's something that we're trying to assess through a number of different mechanisms. But for right now anecdotally what I would say is that we expect month-over-month treatment to be more consistent with clinical trials and that over time, we're obviously aspiring to have better management over time. Kalpit Patel -- B. Riley Financial -- Analyst OK. Got it. Thank you very much. Operator The next question comes from Gil Blum with Needham and Company. Your line is open. Gil Blum -- Analyst Good morning, and thanks for squeezing our question in, and congrats on a very impressive first quarter of sales. So just a couple from us. Now that you have the additional capital, is there a plan on further investing on expanding sales in the U.S., for example or really this is just about keeping that 12-month buffer? And my other question is regarding assumptions on profitability, which you've mentioned. Do you think that includes potential in myelofibrosis? Chip Scarlett -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Michelle, why don't you go ahead and restart? Michelle Robertson -- Executive Vice President, Finance, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer Sure. Yeah. Thanks, Gil. So the reason why we chose this hybrid structure is for the flexibility. So as you recall, we took down the first $250 million, we still have access to another $125 million, really we looked at our strategy around redundancy and second supplier for Rytelo, and that has always been extremely important to us. This now allows us to invest and get ready for a second supplier and for redundancy on our drug substance.

Best NASDAQ Penny Stock to Buy Right Now? Mashaid Ahmed Wed, Dec 11, 2024, 10:15 AM 5 min read In This Article: 002722.SZ -0.97% ^RUT -1.28% ^GSPC -0.76% We recently published a list of 11 Best NASDAQ Penny Stocks To Buy Right Now . In this article, we are going to look at where\u00a0Geron Corporation (NASDAQ: GERN ) stands against other best NASDAQ penny stocks to buy right now. The NASDAQ Stock Market is home to some of the world\u2019s largest companies in the world and also hosts several hundred penny stocks. These companies must meet certain requirements to remain listed on the NASDAQ exchange, including the $1 per share minimum share price thresholds, revenue standards, and market capitalization thresholds. If a company fails to meet these requirements, it may receive noncompliance notifications and eventually be delisted. According to a report by Bloomberg, this year\u2019s market rally has boosted many of the struggling stocks, helping some companies regain compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements. Optimism in U.S. Markets On December 3, Bloomberg reported that Fed Governor Christopher Waller, while addressing a conference in Washington, indicated that he is inclined to vote for a rate cut at the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting on December 17-18. However, Waller emphasized that his decision will depend on the economic data released before the meeting, particularly if it shows an unexpected uptick in inflation. According to Bloomberg, New York Fed President John Williams in a speech in New York said that the economy is continuing to look strong and inflation is likely moving down toward the Fed\u2019s target. However, he emphasized that the path for monetary policy will be contingent upon incoming economic data. He underscored the uncertainty of the economic outlook, noting, \u201cIf we\u2019ve learned anything over the past five years, it\u2019s that the outlook remains highly uncertain.\u201d READ ALSO: 10 Oil Stocks with Biggest Upside Potential According to Analysts and 7 Best Emerging Markets Stocks To Buy Now . In an interview with CNBC on November 15, Nicholas Colas, Co-founder of DataTrek Research, discussed his views on the US stocks and the potential of small caps. Colas recalled how U.S. stocks outperformed global markets during the first Trump administration. Colas acknowledged that current multiples are high, but he is optimistic and believes that multiples can hold or even rise, given the high level of confidence in the US market.\u00a0Regarding small caps, Colas suggested that they are a great trade for the year-end. The Russell 2000, which tracks small-cap performance, has been flat and lagged significantly behind the S&P 500 over the past three years, and presents an amazing opportunity, given that it typically sees a 20% increase. This underperformance makes small caps reasonable holds for the longer term, as they are due for a rebound. Story Continues While the broader market is showing signs of overvaluation, small-cap, and penny stocks have lagged significantly behind over the past few years, creating a compelling opportunity for investors.

is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 72% editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Wed, Dec 18, 2024, 9:19 PM 4 min read In This Article: GERN -0.70% Key Insights Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Geron's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions 51% of the business is held by the top 10 shareholders Ownership research along with analyst forecasts data help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock A look at the shareholders of Geron Corporation ( NASDAQ:GERN ) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 72% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Geron. View our latest analysis for Geron NasdaqGS:GERN Ownership Breakdown December 18th 2024 What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Geron? Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. Geron already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Geron's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. NasdaqGS:GERN Earnings and Revenue Growth December 18th 2024 Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. It would appear that 7.3% of Geron shares are controlled by hedge funds. That's interesting, because hedge funds can be quite active and activist. Many look for medium term catalysts that will drive the share price higher. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.3% and 5.4% of the stock. We also observed that the top 10 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent. Story Continues While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too. Insider Ownership Of Geron While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Geron Corporation. It is a pretty big company, so it would be possible for board members to own a meaningful interest in the company, without owning much of a proportional interest. In this case, they own around US$2.0m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public Ownership The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 15% stake in Geron. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders. Private Equity Ownership Private equity firms hold a 5.3% stake in Geron. This suggests they can be influential in key policy decisions. Some investors might be encouraged by this, since private equity are sometimes able to encourage strategies that help the market see the value in the company. Alternatively, those holders might be exiting the investment after taking it public. Next Steps: While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

Opinion for RYTELO\u2122 (imetelstat) for the Treatment of Adults with Transfusion-Dependent Anemia due to Lower-Risk MDS Business Wire Fri, Dec 13, 2024, 2:36 PM 10 min read In This Article: GERN -0.70% FOSTER CITY, Calif., December 13, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Geron Corporation (Nasdaq: GERN), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company aiming to change lives by changing the course of blood cancer, today announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has adopted a positive opinion recommending the approval of RYTELO (imetelstat) for the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent (TD) anemia due to very low, low or intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes (LR-MDS) without an isolated deletion 5q cytogenetic (non-del 5q) abnormality and who had an unsatisfactory response to or are ineligible for erythropoietin-based therapy. The European Commission (EC), which has the authority to approve medicines in the European Union (EU), will review the CHMP\u2019s recommendation and is expected to make a final decision on the marketing authorization application (MAA) in the following months. \"The positive CHMP opinion is an important step towards our goal to optimize value and patient access to RYTELO in the European Union, where we look forward to the opportunity to make this important new treatment option for LR-MDS patients available in select markets. If approved, RYTELO would be the first and only telomerase inhibitor available in Europe,\" said John A. Scarlett, M.D., Geron\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"We are deeply appreciative to the patients, caregivers, advocates and investigators across the EU who contributed to the clinical development of RYTELO.\" As part of its review of the marketing authorization application (MAA), the CHMP looked at the results from the IMerge Phase 3 clinical trial and assessed that the benefit of RYTELO in patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to very low, low or intermediate risk MDS is a reduction in the need for red blood cell transfusions in the first 24 weeks of treatment compared to placebo, as observed in the double-blind controlled study. The most common side effects were thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP), asthenia and headache. If approved by the EC, RYTELO will be available as 47 mg and 188 mg lyophilized powder for reconstitution in a solution that is administered as an intravenous infusion. Treatment with RYTELO should be administered and monitored under the supervision of physicians and healthcare professionals who are experienced in hematologic diseases and their treatment. Story Continues About Lower-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes (LR-MDS) Lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (LR-MDS) is a blood cancer that often progresses to require increasingly intensified management of key symptoms such as anemia and resulting fatigue 1 . These symptomatic LR-MDS patients frequently become red blood cell transfusion dependent, which has been shown to be associated with short- and long-term clinical consequences that reduce quality of life and shorten survival 2,3 . There is a high unmet need for many LR-MDS patients, particularly those with characteristics having poorer prognosis. Current treatment options for those failing ESA are limited to select sub-populations and there is an unmet need for treatments that can provide extended and continuous red blood cell transfusion independence. About RYTELO\u2122 (imetelstat) A marketing authorization application for RYTELO\u2122 (imetelstat) is under review by the European Commission as a monotherapy treatment for adult patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to very low, low or intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) without an isolated deletion 5q cytogenetic (non-del 5q) abnormality and who had an unsatisfactory response to or are ineligible for erythropoietin-based therapy. RYTELO is an FDA-approved oligonucleotide telomerase inhibitor for the treatment of adult patients with low-to-intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes (LR-MDS) with transfusion-dependent anemia requiring four or more red blood cell units over eight weeks who have not responded to or have lost response to or are ineligible for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). It is indicated to be administered as an intravenous infusion over two hours every four weeks. RYTELO is a first-in-class treatment that works by inhibiting telomerase enzymatic activity. Telomeres are protective caps at the end of chromosomes that naturally shorten each time a cell divides. In LR-MDS, abnormal bone marrow cells often express the enzyme telomerase, which rebuilds those telomeres, allowing for uncontrolled cell division. Developed and exclusively owned by Geron, RYTELO is the first and only telomerase inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thrombocytopenia RYTELO can cause thrombocytopenia based on laboratory values. In the clinical trial, new or worsening Grade 3 or 4 decreased platelets occurred in 65% of patients with MDS treated with RYTELO. Monitor patients with thrombocytopenia for bleeding. Monitor complete blood cell counts prior to initiation of RYTELO, weekly for the first two cycles, prior to each cycle thereafter, and as clinically indicated. Administer platelet transfusions as appropriate. Delay the next cycle and resume at the same or reduced dose, or discontinue as recommended. Neutropenia RYTELO can cause neutropenia based on laboratory values. In the clinical trial, new or worsening Grade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophils occurred in 72% of patients with MDS treated with RYTELO. Monitor patients with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia for infections, including sepsis. Monitor complete blood cell counts prior to initiation of RYTELO, weekly for the first two cycles, prior to each cycle thereafter, and as clinically indicated. Administer growth factors and anti-infective therapies for treatment or prophylaxis as appropriate. Delay the next cycle and resume at the same or reduced dose, or discontinue as recommended. Infusion-Related Reactions RYTELO can cause infusion-related reactions. In the clinical trial, infusion-related reactions occurred in 8% of patients with MDS treated with RYTELO; Grade 3 or 4 infusion-related reactions occurred in 1.7%, including hypertensive crisis (0.8%). The most common infusion-related reaction was headache (4.2%). Infusion-related reactions usually occur during or shortly after the end of the infusion. Premedicate patients at least 30 minutes prior to infusion with diphenhydramine and hydrocortisone as recommended and monitor patients for one hour following the infusion as recommended. Manage symptoms of infusion-related reactions with supportive care and infusion interruptions, decrease infusion rate, or permanently discontinue as recommended. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity RYTELO can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with RYTELO and for 1 week after the last dose. ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious adverse reactions occurred in 32% of patients who received RYTELO. Serious adverse reactions in >2% of patients included sepsis (4.2%) and fracture (3.4%), cardiac failure (2.5%), and hemorrhage (2.5%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 0.8% of patients who received RYTELO, including sepsis (0.8%). Most common adverse reactions (\u226510% with a difference between arms of >5% compared to placebo), including laboratory abnormalities, were decreased platelets, decreased white blood cells, decreased neutrophils, increased AST, increased alkaline phosphatase, increased ALT, fatigue, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, arthralgia/myalgia, COVID-19 infections, and headache.
