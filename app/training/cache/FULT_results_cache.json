Positive Points Fulton Financial Corp ( NASDAQ:FULT ) achieved a record $1.2 billion in total revenue for 2024, marking a significant milestone for the company. The company successfully completed and integrated the Republic transaction, realizing cost savings and financial contributions as expected. FULT's non-interest income grew by $31 million or 13.4% to $259 million, with all non-interest income generating businesses showing growth. The company declared dividends of $0.69 per share, representing a 6% increase year over year. FULT maintained a stable net interest margin of 3.42% despite a volatile interest rate environment, which is seen as a positive outcome. Negative Points Total loans declined by $131 million in the fourth quarter due to portfolio repositioning and a planned decline in the indirect auto portfolio. The provision for credit losses was $16.7 million, with the ratio of ACL to total loans increasing to 1.58%, indicating caution as the company enters 2025. Net interest income on a non-FTE basis decreased by $4 million linked quarter, with the net interest margin declining by eight basis points to 3.41%. The company faces ongoing pressure from higher rates and costs, impacting its performance in 2024. FULT's tangible capital ratio was flat despite being impacted by an additional OCI reserve of $44.5 million, ending the year at a negative $288 million. Story Continues Q & A Highlights Q : Can you clarify the guidance on average earning asset growth? Is it based on the annual number or a decline from the fourth quarter number? A : We didn't provide guidance on average earning assets. Our focus is on net interest income guidance, and we expect low to mid-single digit growth on both sides of the balance sheet in the current operating environment. - Curtis Myers, CEO Q : Could you discuss the provision guidance and how you see loss rates evolving? Are we in a normalization process or approaching a peak? A : For 2024, we were in line with expectations, and for 2025, we expect a similar year with a provision range of $60 million to $80 million. We have a bigger reserve going into the year, and we see things as stable relative to past experiences. - Curtis Myers, CEO Q : Regarding the net interest income guidance, how should we think about the margin's cadence throughout the year? A : We are avoiding specific margin guidance due to potential dynamics. However, we expect to start the year slightly lower in Q1 and gradually drift higher over the course of the year. - Richard Kraemer, CFO Q : What is the status of the Fulton First initiative in terms of realized cost savings? A : In the fourth quarter, we realized just under $5 million in cost savings on a quarterly basis. For 2025, we estimate $25 million in total savings for the year. - Richard Kraemer, CFO Q : Can you provide an update on the retention of Republic Bank deposits and any trends affecting margin expansion? A : The deposit portfolio is stable, and we are ahead of our initial assumptions on potential runoff. The team is managing it well, and we continue to see stability in the deposit base. - Curtis Myers, CEO For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .

Non-interest expense decreased $9.5 million to $216.6 million compared to $226.1 million in the prior quarter. Operating non-interest expense decreased $5.5 million to $190.7 million (1) compared to $196.2 million in the prior quarter. Provision for credit losses was $16.7 million resulting in an allowance for credit losses attributable to net loans of $379.2 million , or 1.58% of total net loans at December 31, 2024 . Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $62.2 million compared to the prior quarter.

FultonFirst implementation and asset disposal costs of $10.0 million , including $8.5 million in connection with the Corporation's plan to consolidate fifteen financial centers in early 2025. Story Continues The following items highlight notable changes in the components of net income in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2024: Net interest income totaled $253.7 million , a decrease of $4.4 million , which was largely due to a decline in short-term interest rates. A decrease in interest income on net loans of $15.4 million was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities of $8.9 million . An increase in interest income on investment securities of $6.8 million was partially offset by a decrease in interest income on other interest-earning assets of $4.6 million . $1.1 million in fees were realized during the quarter due to early payoffs in the leasing portfolio. Purchase loan mark accretion from loans acquired in the Acquisition was $13.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $14.5 million in the prior quarter. Non-interest income before investment securities gains (losses) was $65.9 million compared to $59.7 million in the prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to a $5.0 million change in the gain on acquisition (net of tax). A $2.7 million reduction in the gain on acquisition (net of tax) was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024. Non-interest expense was $216.6 million compared to $226.1 million in the prior quarter. The decrease was largely due to a $10.9 million decrease in employee salaries and benefits expense, a $4.6 million decrease in acquisition-related expense and a $2.6 million decrease in net occupancy expense, partially offset by $7.8 million of fixed asset and disposal costs in connection with planned FultonFirst financial center consolidations. The decrease in employee salaries and benefits expense was driven by a $4.9 million decrease in employee severance costs related to the FultonFirst initiative, a $3.4 million decrease due to cost savings realized related to the Acquisition and a $2.5 million decrease in employee incentive compensation costs. Balance Sheet Summary Net loans totaled $24.0 billion , a decrease of $131.2 million , compared to $24.2 billion as of September 30, 2024 . The decline in balance was due to a net decrease of $168.1 million in commercial and other loans (4) , partially offset by an increase of $36.9 million in consumer loans (4) . Deposits totaled $26.1 billion , a decrease of $22.7 million , compared to $26.2 billion as of September 30, 2024 . The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $136.8 million in time deposits, partially offset by increases of $64.1 million in interest-bearing demand deposits and $51.5 million in savings deposits. Provision for Credit Losses and Asset Quality The provision for credit losses was $16.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, resulting in an allowance for credit losses attributable to net loans of $379.2 million , or 1.58% of total net loans at December 31, 2024 , compared to $376.0 million , or 1.56% of total net loans at September 30, 2024 . Non-performing assets were $222.7 million , or 0.69% of total assets, at December 31, 2024 , in comparison to $205.0 million , or 0.64% of total assets, at September 30, 2024 .

These forward-looking statements may include projections of, or guidance on, the Corporation's future financial performance, expected levels of future expenses, including future credit losses, anticipated growth strategies, descriptions of new business initiatives and anticipated trends in the Corporation's business or financial results. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts, nor assurance of future performance. Instead, the statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of the Corporation's business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Corporation's control, and actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not unduly rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement is based only on information currently available and speaks only as of the date when made. The Corporation undertakes no obligation, other than as required by law, to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A discussion of certain risks and uncertainties affecting the Corporation, and some of the factors that could cause the Corporation's actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, can be found in the sections entitled \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 , Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 , June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024 and other current and periodic reports, which have been, or will be, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") and are, or will be, available in the Investor Relations section of the Corporation's website ( www.fultonbank.com ) and on the SEC's website ( www.sec.gov ). Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Corporation uses certain financial measures in this press release that have been derived from methods other than GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in tables at the end of this press release.

FULTON FINANCIAL CORPORATION RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES (UNAUDITED) (dollars in thousands, except per share and share data) Explanatory note: This press release contains supplemental financial information, as detailed below, that has been derived by methods other than GAAP. The Corporation has presented these non-GAAP financial measures because it believes that these measures provide useful and comparative information to assess trends in the Corporation's results of operations and financial condition. Presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is consistent with how the Corporation evaluates its performance internally and these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the Corporation's industry. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP measures, are also useful to investors to evaluate the Corporation's results.

I'll be providing a summary of the operating highlights for the fourth quarter and for the year. In addition, I'll provide the status of a few key strategic initiatives. Then Rick will review our financial results in more detail and step through our 2025 operating guidance. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take any questions. You may have Fulton's results for the fourth quarter and for the year were driven by the extraordinary effort of our team. We worked together to deliver a very successful year, both operationally and strategically. For the year we delivered on our strategy and focused on our corporate mission to change lives for the better. As a result, we grew to more than 750,000 customers reached $1.2 billion in total revenue. A record for the company. We delivered strong operating earnings per share, which was also a record performance, and we made tremendous impact in the communities that we serve. We completed and fully integrated the Republic transaction, delivering strong financial results on an aggressive timeline. We made significant progress on our Fulton first transformation. This strategic initiative simplifies our operating model focuses on key strengths and enhances productivity across the bank. We strengthened our balance sheet by completing a sale lease back transaction. We restructured our investment portfolio, and we improved our liquidity and enhanced our earnings power. Our capital position grew throughout the year as we generated solid internal capital and supplemented that position with a successful capital raise. As a result, we delivered a strong year and positioned the company for continued success in 2025 and beyond our 2024 financial results were strong, especially considering the backdrop of a volatile interest rate environment, operating earnings per share of a dollar 85 was driven by strong fundamentals, the impact of the Republic transaction and the initial positive impact of our Fulton first initiative in 2024 total deposit growth was solid. Legacy Fulton deposits grew $878 million or 4.1%. And when including Republic deposits, total deposit growth was $4.6 billion or 21.3% for the year. Total loan growth was meaningful. While Legacy Fulton loans grew $16 million or 1.5%. Total loan growth for the year was $2.7 billion or 12.6%. When including Republic, our net interest margin was consistent with last year at 3.42%. Given the volatile interest rate environment. We feel that this was a positive outcome. Our non-interest income growth was strong excluding the impact of the gain on acquisition and the loss on the securities restructuring. Non-interest income grew $31 million or 13.4% to $259 million. All non-interest income generating businesses grew led by wealth management at $9.2 million or 12.2% growth. Non-interest income continues to be a meaningful contributor to total revenue at over 20%. We declared dividends of $0.69 per share. A 6% increase year over year and we continue to actively manage through the credit environment, working with borrowers and managing relationships for long term performance. While we see pressure due to the ongoing impact of higher rates and higher cost performance in 2024 was in line with our expectations overall, we were pleased with our performance and the results our team generated throughout the year. Now let me turn to our quarterly results. Operating earnings for the quarter was $0.48 per share. A stable balance sheet and noticeable improvement in expenses drove the quarter total deposits were relatively flat with deposit costs down 10 basis points length, quarter, total loans declined $131 million linked quarter. We generated a consistent level of originations. However, organic growth was offset by portfolio repositioning of selected Republic loans as well as the planned decline in our indirect auto portfolio. Our loan to deposit ratio ended the year at 92% slightly below our long-term operating target of 95 to 105. This position continues to provide balance sheet flexibility. Non-interest income for the quarter was $68.6 million. Up $1.2 million linked quarter. When excluding the adjustment to the bargain purchase gain, the provision for credit losses was $16.7 million and our ratio of ACL to total loans increased to 1.58% overall asset quality end of the year in line with our expectations and we remain cautious as we enter 2025. Now, I'll provide updates on two key initiatives. First, let me comment on the status of the Republic transaction during the quarter. We completed the systems conversion, finalized our integration efforts and are now realizing cost savings in line with our initial assumptions, we saw noticeable financial contributions to the fourth quarter results and are excited to see the full benefits impact our results in 2025. Finally, I'll provide you with our progress on Fulton first. As a reminder, Fulton first is an important initiative designed to enhance growth, improve operating effectiveness and create sustainability, positive operating leverage over time. We are encouraged by the progress we've made to date and we're looking forward to the full benefit realization over the next year and beyond. For 2025 we expect the initiative will improve our operating efficiency and allow us to keep our expenses flat on a year over year basis. We feel this is a significant accomplishment in the current operating environment. Now I'll turn the call over to Rick to discuss our financial performance and our 2025 operating guidance in more detail. Richard Kraemer Thank you, Curt and good morning. Unless I note otherwise, the quarterly comparisons I discuss are with the third quarter of 2024 loan and deposit road numbers. I may reference our annualized percentages on a linked quarter basis. Starting on slide. Five operating earnings per diluted share was $0.48 or$ 88.9 million of operating net income available to common shareholders. Deposit growth was relatively flat for the quarter growth and interest-bearing demand and savings account products were offset by a decline in time deposits. Our non-interest-bearing DD. Balances were flat in quarter at $5.5 billion and remained at 21% of total deposits. As previously mentioned, total loans declined $131 million during the quarter. Due to the portfolio dynamics. We discussed on hand balance sheet liquidity remains strong at over 19% of liabilities and included an increase of securities of $261 million offset by a decline in cash of $380 million. Some of the decline in cash balances can be attributed to the maturity and subsequent repayment of $168 million of subordinated debt in the quarter impacts of these balance sheet. Trends are shown on slide. Six net interest income on a non-FTE basis was $254 million. A $4 million decrease linked quarter while net interest margin declined by eight basis points to 3.41%. The linked quarter decline was primarily driven by the effects of 100 basis points of easing by the fed from September through December. In addition, we added $900 million to receive fixed hedges to support a more neutral interest rate. Risk profile loan yields declined 23 basis points linked quarter to 5.97% included in the loan yield is $13.9 million of accretion attributable to the purchase. Accounting marks on the acquired Republic loan portfolio. Our average cost of total deposits decreased 10 basis points to 2.14% link quarter. This decline was primarily due to the deposit pricing actions taken in tandem with the fed monetary policy. Turning to noninterest income on slide, seven noninterest incomes for the quarter was $65.9 million. This included a fair value adjustment to the bargain purchase gain attributable to the Republic transaction of 2.7 million. Excluding this adjustment, the income increased $1.2 million or 7% linked quarter. Moving to slide 8 non-interest expense on an operating basis was $190.6 million. A decrease of $5.5 million link quarter or 3% on a linked quarter annualized basis. As of December 2024, we are achieving our projected annualized cost save estimate of 40% from the acquisition of Republic and are realizing the efficiency benefits of Fulton first material items excluded from operating expenses as listed on slide. Eight were charges of $10 million of Fulton first implementation and asset disposal expense. $9.6 million of acquisition related expenses and $6.2 million a core deposit intangible amortization. Turning your attention to slide 9, you'll see a reminder of the expected benefits of the Fulton per initiative and financial assumptions. According to asset quality, the net charge off ratio was up modestly to 22 basis points. While nonperforming assets to total assets increased five basis points to 69 basis points. Our AC L to total loans remains near historical highs at 1.58%. While the AC L for nonperforming loans came in at 172%. Slide11 shows a snapshot of our capital base. As of 31st, December we maintained solid cushions over the regulatory minimums. Our tangible capital ratio was flat one quarter despite being impacted by additional OC I reserve of $44.5 million. OC, I ended the year at a negative $288 million. On slide 12, we are providing our operating guidance for 2025. Our guidance incorporates the projected decrease in fed funds of 25 basis points in March and 25 basis points in June of 2025 for 2025. Our operating guidance is as follows. We expect our net interest income on a non-FTE basis to be in the range of $995 million to $1.02 billion. We expect our provision for credit losses to be in the range of $60million to $80 million. We expect our non-interest income to be in the range of $265 million to $280 million and we expect our non-interest expense on an operating basis to be in the range of $755 million to $775 million for the year. Our operating estimate excludes potential quote, first charges of $14 million and CDI amortization estimated to be $22.5 million. $7 and lastly, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18% for the year. With that. We'll now turn the call back over to Victor for questions. Question and Answer Session Operator Thank you. And as a reminder to ask a question, (operator Instructions) Our first question comes line of Danny Tamayo from Raymond James. Your line is open. Daniel Tamayo Thank you. Good morning, guys. Maybe just start with a clarification question if I can on the average earning asset guidance, the growth, the low single digits that's off of the annual number, the 28,595 number I'm assuming. And if so is that what's it's, it's a decline from the fourth quarter number? Just curious, what's driving it? Richard Kraemer Sorry. Can, can you clarify? We didn't provide guidance on average earning assets. Daniel Tamayo I apologize. I'm not sure if I'm looking at the wrong thing here. Well, why don't we just talk a little bit about, what you're thinking in terms of, of balance sheet growth for the year and kind of where you may see that in terms of loans and on the deposit side as well. Curtis Myers Yeah, Danny, it current so we're really focused on giving an I guidance which you can see in the information and then on asset growth, you know, we continue in this operating environment to expect low to mid single digit growth on both sides of the balance sheet as we move forward. Daniel Tamayo Okay? Alright, fair enough. And then maybe you can just talk a little bit about the provision guidance. You know, curious how you guys are, you're thinking about like loss rates going forward if the are we in a normalization process? Are we approaching a peak? You know, just curious where you guys see normal reserves given that the little bit of movement we've seen there as well. Curtis Myers Yeah, so for, for 2024 we had given guidance in $40 million to $60 million and the provision excluding the day one Cecil double count was just under $50 million. So, we're right in line with expectations last year. The guidance going forward, the balance sheet's a little bigger this year based on the acquisition. So, looking at that and looking at where we're positioned right now, you know, we expect a similar year as we did last year and that's why we have that operating range on provision. We have a bigger reserve you know, going into the year. And that's kind of how we see things right now pretty stable. You know, relative to what we've experienced. Daniel Tamayo Got you. So, what I was looking at the just to clarify the first question, I was looking at your comment on the operating guidance slide, low single digit interest earning asset growth. So, you're saying that's period end and not average? Richard Kraemer Yeah, that would be period end. Daniel Tamayo Got it. Okay. I think that answers my question then. All right, that's all I had. Thanks for taking my questions. Curtis Myers Thanks, David. Operator Thank you one moment for our next question. Next question come from the line of Chris McGtatty from KBW. Your line is open. Christopher McGratty Hey, how's it going? This is Angela on for Chris McGtatty morning just on the NI guide. It looks like with you know, the growth you gave in the guidance, it implies a relatively stable margin. Possibly be thinking about the cadence of the margin as we move throughout the year. Thanks. Richard Kraemer Yeah, look, I think we're going to try to stay away from specific margin guidance just given the potential for, several dynamics. When we think about NIII would tend to think cadence over the year would be, starting the year, slightly lower in one Q given some growth and also day count adjustments and then gradually drifting higher over the course of the year. Christopher McGratty Okay, thank you. And I know you've said in the past that buybacks have been third in line for capital use. Has the environment or your appetite changed to start thinking about buying back shares here in 2020 five. Curtis Myers You know, our priority for capital utilization would be the same and that that would remain third on the list that we do have an approved authorization. So, we have that, that corporate flexibility to, to do that. But our priorities remain the same. Christopher McGratty Okay, great. Thank you. Operator I'll step back. Thank you one moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of David Bishop from Hovde group. Your line is open. David Bishop Hey, good morning, gentlemen. Curtis Myers Good morning. Hey. David Bishop Just curious in terms of the fault and first initiative, I appreciate the guidance. Just curious, I mean, to date, I don't know if there's a way to quantify maybe, realize cost saves or cost saves that are already sort of in the run rate. Richard Kraemer Yeah. So, I in fourth quarter, we look at about just under $5 million in the run rate. So, on a quarterly basis. David Bishop Got it. And then I think the 25 is estimated to be $25 million, correct in terms of the whole year. Richard Kraemer Yeah. So, I think that the simplistic view is, you take that obviously multiply the five by four that's 20 you get incremental quarterly saves over the course of the year, getting your $20. David Bishop Got it. And then in terms of the maybe you know, shifting gears there, but the retention of the Republic Bank deposits, just curious, you know, what you're seeing there in trends and, are you seeing any sort of makeshift there? That's, either, aiding or a betting margin expansion. Thanks. Curtis Myers Yeah, overall, the deposit portfolio, the team's managing it well and it's stable. So, we had initial run off, I think we talked last quarter about its stabilizing that continued through throughout this quarter. That, deposit base has been pretty stable, and we continue to be ahead of our initial assumptions on potential runoff. David Bishop Got it. And then maybe just a housekeeping question, I know sometimes tough to predict but, purchase accounting a Christian income about $13.9 million. Any sense, maybe where that, that average is per quarter into 2025. Thanks. Richard Kraemer Yeah, on a quarterly basis, you should be looking somewhere in that $13.5million to $14 million. Perfect. Thank you. Curtis Myers Okay, thank you. Operator Thank you one moment for our next question. Our next question will come. The line of Matthew Breese from Stevens. Your line is open. Curtis Myers Hey, good morning. Matthew Breese Or, you know, first off, I was just hoping for maybe a reminder on the breakout between floating adjustable and fixed rate loans and kind of what drove loan yields this quarter. I'm assuming it was just all floating and, then the other thing I was hoping for along the same lines, you know, given some of your, your fed outlook expectations, where do you expect loan yields to bottom during the year yields were down 23 BPS this quarter. I was thinking you have another quarter or two of down yields, but to a lesser extent, I was hoping you could walk me through that a little bit. Thanks. Richard Kraemer Yeah, sure, Matt. So, on, just to put your attention slide 14 of us of our earnings supplement. We did; we did put a little bit more detail in there on the bottom left corner in terms of the actual dollar breakout of variable versus fixed versus adjustable. And then, did provide some awa the weighted average contractual repricing date in terms of periods of years. So that'll give you a little bit of a of a look in terms of obviously the variable component is just under $10 billion is relatively short called sub one month in terms of repricing. But the adjustable piece at $5.7 billion reprices on average at 4.48 years, right? So, it certainly acts more fixed in the short term. I would also lead you to, the coupons on that book x purchase accounting or closer to 5%. So, you get, you do get a tailwind in the current environment of those were pricing over the call at the next, at least the foreseeable future with where rates are great. Matthew Breese I appreciate that. And then, and then the second part of the question was just, given your fed rate outlook expectations, walk me through kind of loan yield expectations. And where do you expect, where do you expect to hit the bottom on loan yields with two cuts this year? You know, feels like the NIM is going to be down and to the right or NII is going to be down into the right beginning of the year, but up into the right as we kind of get past the fed cuts. Richard Kraemer Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, I'm a little hesitant to give a number on loan yields, but directionally in the cadence, you're right, assuming we get the fed to pause, you should start to see a fairly nice rebound because of that repricing dynamic I mentioned on the adjustable piece, right? So a little bit, probably similar type of maybe we got 100 basis points effectively September through December. So, I wouldn't expect quite the same amount of pressure on mons but directionally and timing wise, I think you're right. Matthew Breese Appreciate that. And then, Rick last quarter, we talked a little bit about the deposit rate environment. I think you had said something to the effect of, near term around the 10% be a longer term, 30%. You know, just give us some colour on the deposit competitive environment and how you're faring relative to those goals. And when do you think you can hit kind of that 30% debate? Beta goal? Richard Kraemer Yeah, I think Matt, if we look at as I look at least on spot rates, we are approaching on MNDs cycle, which is obviously a short cycle, call it 20% plus mid 20s. So, I think, I think we're probably going to get close there hopefully in the next couple quarters. Certainly, the pricing dynamics have been beneficial. I would also point on the total deposits on that same page by 14, you'll recognize that we have a substantial amount of time deposits that mature over the course of 2025. And some of the pricing on those at least on average is call it 436 retail CDS makes up, make up about 85% of that. And those have seen fairly substantial downward repricing. So similar rate calls it 435 I would expect to see 5,080 basis points potentially more of benefit over the course of the year assuming a stable competitive market. Matthew Breese Great and then last one before I hop back in the queue, you know, low to mid-single digit loan growth for the year was hoping for some clarity on where you expect to grow and where you, where you do not expect to grow. The last couple of quarters C&I has been weak, but it's been, other areas have kind of helped out and I'm curious if we continue to see that trend in 25. Curtis Myers Yeah, we're in a position to really focus on growth in all categories. You know, so we feel good about where our CRE position is. C&I is always a focus, consumer is always a focus for us. So, we're going to continue to be focused on the diversification of the balance sheet and trying to grow. You know, in all categories. You know, we do have two the headwind that we had in this past quarter around the consumer, indirect auto run off and some repositioning of acquired loans. So, we might continue to have some of those headwinds and that's why we're looking at the low to mid-single digit loan growth. Matthew Breese Great. Thank you. I appreciate that. Operator Thank you one moment for our next question. We have a follow up from the line of Danny Tamayo from Raymond James. Your line is open. Daniel Tamayo Oh, great. Well, again, the just a couple of quick ones here first. I know you guys aren't talking about margin but just curious if you have an expectation or, how you're thinking about the accretion income expected this year. Richard Kraemer Yeah, it should be fairly stable kind of in the $13.5million to $14 million a quarter. So, you're looking at 4.5 to 4.6 or 4.7 a month. It tends to, it'll drip slightly lower as the year goes on, but that's a good range. Daniel Tamayo Okay? And, and hearing you say that I think you, you've said that already. So, I apologize for the second question. Hopefully this one is also not a repeat but just curious on, the guidance where you talked about the line items impacted by lower rates. I'm sorry, by rates in terms of fee income. Curious, specifically where, where those might show up and then your thoughts on mortgage banking within the fee income guidance overall. Richard Kraemer Yeah, I look, I think on rates depending on what happens like the more volatile business lines or the more exposed business lines to rates are going to be mortgage banking, as you mentioned, commercial swaps, certainly. And then also wealth management, I think, look at depending on where rates move, equity market movement, obviously, you know, correlates to the revenues of that business. So those, those are the primary pieces. Daniel Tamayo You think some of those line items could actually be down in 2025 versus 24 or just a slower growth rate. Richard Kraemer We're coming off of historic record growth in our wealth management. You've had two years consecutive of 20% plus returns on the S&P. So, I think we're being appropriately conservative in some of the forecast there. And then again, commercial swaps if we, if we're expecting low to bid single loan growth, it likely won't be a huge year there. Okay. Alright. Daniel Tamayo Thanks. Thanks for taking my follow up. I appreciate it. Operator And thank you one moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Frank Schiraldi from Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Frank Schiraldi Hey, good morning. All right, just wanted to ask about, you got the systems conversion that RBK completed, and you obviously still have work you're going through with the Fulton first initiative, but just curious where potential M&A fits in terms of priorities. Is that something more likely to be looked at after Fulton first, is that something that you could do incrementally? In the nearer term, just curious your thoughts and, maybe guideposts around what you would be looking for in potential deals. Curtis Myers Yeah, Frank, it's correct. You know, our strategy is the same on M&A we look at you know, $1 billion to $5 billion community banks in market really, really have a, consistent culture and operating model and provide, and accelerate our growth. And then more strategic, larger ones, we look at them really in two different buckets. That strategy is the same to being to your question of being in position to look at M&A. We feel we are back in position to look at M&A right now and we would weigh the various corporate initiatives that we have going on to make sure that it's appropriate thing for us to do. And that we can handle all the different activities. So, we are engaged as we always are in that activity and it's a possibility, but again, we will make sure we have the operating capability to, to make sure we execute effectively. Frank Schiraldi Okay. And then then sorry if I'm, you've probably clarified this in the past, but just in the full and first initiative, the $50 million kind of run rate through 2026. Is that on the fully on the expense side, is there any additional pick up there on the revenue side anticipated from the initiative? Richard Kraemer Yeah, all that guidance Frank is expense based. Okay. Frank Schiraldi So is that, yeah, sorry. Manuel Navas Go ahead and. Curtis Myers Frank just to add there are growth initiatives as well, pretty significant growth initiatives. But we aren't building those into the numbers and they're going to be in our run rate as we execute, going forward there to drive corporate growth. But you know, we won't line, them, We're just going to generate and execute on those strategies. Matthew Jozwiak Got you. Okay. Frank Schiraldi Do you think the timeline is sort of the same in terms of fully integrated by, 2026 not to put too fine a point on it? Curtis Myers Yeah, so the strategy implementation will be on the same timeline, but with any revenue growth, it takes time to build a customer base and build that revenue. So that that is over time and again will be included in, our overall growth forecast and expectations. Got it. Okay. Frank Schiraldi Makes sense. Thank you. Operator Thank you one moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Manuel Navas from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Manuel Navas Maybe just to follow up on that. Can you go into more detail about some of the revenue initiatives? I guess some of them are definitely year out for another quarter along the process to see if you could give any more update on that kind of commercial growth initiatives. Curtis Myers Yeah, just because some overall comments, you know, a lot of the initiatives are to focus on our core strengths. So, where we are currently performing well, add value, clients have a strong strategy to further enhance that growth and focus on that. And then specifically on the business, banking, small business, we've done well. And in our marketplace, it is a significant opportunity around number of customers and revenue growth. So that is the specific line item or customer segment that we focus on even more than we already do. We have a significant customer base now. But we think we can have a transformative growth in the small business category. Manuel Navas Should we expect kind of more updates as the year goes on? Or maybe a year from now would be the update. What, how should we think about that revenue generating opportunity? Curtis Myers Yeah, over time, we're going to talk about those business segments and growth o over time. So you will, we'll hear more about it. We probably through the, through this year you'll hear it in the construct of Fulton first but long term you know, you'll hear about it just as we operate and, and drive value and growth. Manuel Navas Great, great. Just shift over loan growth for a second. Did you give an update on commercial loan pipelines? II apologize that I missed that, and I just wanted to hear if there's is that loan reposition FRBK side? Is, is that kind of done? Are there any more headwinds from that? And the indirect auto anticipated? Just kind of thoughts on near term loan growth with those in mind. Richard Kraemer Yeah, yeah, specifically to the headwind. So, on the indirect side, we the portfolio is around $390 million in balances remaining and it's got an average duration of about 2.6 years. So, I think you can all see you, you'd expect to see a similar type of run off for a quarter, call it, in that $40 million range. But in terms of the Republic repositioning, I think you know, we're integrated in the fourth quarter. So that was probably the largest actions you'll see. But I, let Curt kind of elaborate more on some other details. Curtis Myers Yeah, I just want to go back to the first part of your question. So those are the headwinds that in direct auto and then, as you work through, through an acquisition. You know, you're going to have some of that, that will moderate as we move forward and again on Republic. You know, we want to get to stability and deposit stability and loans and then grow from there. So, the team is really focused on growing that strategic marketplace in the greater Philadelphia metro area. So, we think we have a really strong base to grow from, I think you'll see that pivot throughout this year as we work through those transitions. And did we get the first part of your question. Manuel Navas Commercial pipelines? I don't believe so unless, unless I missed it somewhere else. Curtis Myers Yeah. So, on commercial pipeline, the pipeline is relatively flat, so pretty consistent and we've really been focused on the pull through rate. So, you know, our borrowers you know, moving forward, are they expanding? Are they buying that equipment? And we really haven't seen much of a change there, but we're hoping that the environment improves and that our underlying business customers become more confident to move forward on projects. So, we really don't think we have to grow the pipeline as much as ha have borrowers be confident in this environment to move forward with projects. Manuel Navas I appreciate that commentary and that kind of matches what many have said may. So maybe loan growth kind of grows across the year as folks become more certain on the economy and our policy, is that kind of the main thought process, correct? I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this moment. I would like to turn it back over to Curt Myers for closing remarks. Curtis Myers Well, thank you again for joining us today. We hope you'll be able to be with us when we discuss first quarter results in April. Thank you. Operator Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect everyone. Have a great day.

Fulton Financial Simply Wall St Dividend Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Overview: Fulton Financial Corporation is a financial holding company offering consumer and commercial banking products and services across Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and Virginia, with a market cap of approximately $3.47 billion. Operations: Fulton Financial Corporation generates revenue primarily through its banking segment, which reported $1.08 billion. Dividend Yield: 3.7% Fulton Financial offers a stable dividend history, with dividends reliably growing over the past 10 years and currently covered by earnings at a 42.4% payout ratio. The recent increase in its quarterly common stock dividend to $0.18 per share reflects confidence in its financial health, despite shareholder dilution last year. Trading below estimated fair value and initiating a $100 million share buyback program may enhance future shareholder returns, though current yield remains modest compared to top-tier U.S. dividend payers. Unlock comprehensive insights into our analysis of Fulton Financial stock in this dividend report. In light of our recent valuation report, it seems possible that Fulton Financial is trading behind its estimated value. NasdaqGS:FULT Dividend History as at Jan 2025 Buckle Simply Wall St Dividend Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Overview: The Buckle, Inc. is a U.S.-based retailer specializing in casual apparel, footwear, and accessories for young men and women, with a market cap of approximately $2.51 billion. Operations: The Buckle, Inc.'s revenue is primarily derived from its casual apparel, footwear, and accessories segment, totaling approximately $1.22 billion. Story Continues Dividend Yield: 7.6% Buckle's dividend profile is mixed, with a high yield of 7.6% placing it among the top U.S. payers, but payments have been volatile and not consistently covered by free cash flows, evidenced by a 103% cash payout ratio. Recent announcements include a $2.85 per share combined special and quarterly dividend payable in January 2025, yet significant insider selling raises concerns about long-term sustainability despite trading below estimated fair value. Get an in-depth perspective on Buckle's performance by reading our dividend report here. Insights from our recent valuation report point to the potential undervaluation of Buckle shares in the market. NYSE:BKE Dividend History as at Jan 2025 Copa Holdings Simply Wall St Dividend Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Overview: Copa Holdings, S.A. operates through its subsidiaries to offer airline passenger and cargo services, with a market cap of $3.62 billion. Operations: Copa Holdings generates revenue primarily from its air transportation segment, which amounts to $3.48 billion. Dividend Yield: 7.3% Copa Holdings offers a high dividend yield of 7.3%, ranking it among the top U.S. dividend payers, but its payments have been volatile and not consistently covered by free cash flows, with a cash payout ratio of 243.4%.

Earnings Report? Zacks Equity Research Fri, Jan 3, 2025, 8:10 PM 3 min read In This Article: FULT -2.90% Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Fulton Financial (FULT), which belongs to the Zacks Banks - Northeast industry, could be a great candidate to consider. When looking at the last two reports, this financial holding company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 50.82%, on average, in the last two quarters. For the most recent quarter, Fulton Financial was expected to post earnings of $0.44 per share, but it reported $0.50 per share instead, representing a surprise of 13.64%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.25 per share, while it actually produced $0.47 per share, a surprise of 88%. For Fulton Financial, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank. Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Fulton Financial has an Earnings ESP of +2.38% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. Investors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric. Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate. Story Continues Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
