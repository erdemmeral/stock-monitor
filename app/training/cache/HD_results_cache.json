[{"text": "Bill Holdings and Baidu have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day Zacks Equity Research Tue, Jan 28, 2025, 4:36 PM 10 min read In this article: BIDU +2.55% WMT +0.55% HD -0.16% COST -0.22% For Immediate Release Chicago, IL \u2013 January 28, 2025 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares Bill Holdings BILL as the Bull of the Day and Baidu BIDU as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Walmart Inc. WMT, Costco Wholesale Corp. COST and The Home Depot, Inc. HD. Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: Bull of the Day: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock Bill Holdings is a cloud-based software firm that leverages AI to help customers automate and streamline back-office financial operations for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). The California-based company's vast umbrella of products includes software-as-as-service solutions for accounts payable, accounts receivable, supply management, and client management. BILL Bolsters Offering through M&A Bill Holdings is growing organically and through acquisition. In 2022, Bill Acquired Finmark, \"a leading financial planning software provider that simplifies financial planning and cash flow insights for SMBs.\" Bill also made strategic acquisitions in Divvy (spend & expense software) and Invoice2go. Robust Sales & Earnings Growth History BILL's niche market, a vast array of products, and aggressive acquisition strategy are working. The company has achieved double-digit top-and-bottom-line growth for five consecutive quarters. In addition, BILL tends to smash Wall Street EPS expectations. The company has delivered positive earnings surprises in the past four quarters, with an average EPS surprise of 29.84% (versus Zacks Consensus Estimates). DeepSeek Rattles US Equity Markets, but is it Bullish for Software? \"DeepSeek,\" an open-source Chinese AI model, is the buzzword currently among Wall Street circles. According to DeepSeek, its \"DeepSeek-R1\" model can outperform the most popular large language models (LLMs), such as Meta Platform's\"Llama\" and OpenAI and Microsoft'sChatGPT. In addition, DeepSeek claims that its large language model was could be trained with a fraction of the expensive NvidiaGPUs used in other LLMs, sending shockwaves through Wall Street. Though investors are still analyzing the fallout from DeepSeek and waiting for the smoke to clear, many wonder if AI will be commoditized. Software companies that leverage AI, like Bill Holdings, should benefit dramatically if this is the case. Currently, the software group ranks an impressive 47 out of the 250 industries tracked by Zacks (top 19%). Meanwhile, software stocks such as Twilio and Snowflake exhibited standout relative strength during Monday's equity bloodbath \u2013 a bullish sign. Story continues Bullish Chart Pattern In addition to robust relative strength, BILL shares are breaking out of a bull flag pattern after finding support at the rising 50-day moving average. Bottom Line Software is a rare bright spot in an otherwise weak tech sector. As a result, stocks like BILL Holdings may benefit as money flows out of chip stocks. Bear of the Day: Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock Baidu is a Chinese technology company that offers multiple internet services. With a focus on mainland China users, Baidu is best known for its search engine dominance (owns ~54% market share in China). However, the company has branched out into several other offerings. Baidu also offers cloud computing, artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, and online services like video streaming (iQIYI), an online encyclopedia (Baidu Baike), and even a popular discussion forum (Baidu Tieba). Like America's Alphabet,Baidu strikes to be a one-stop destination for Chinese and global internet users. BIDU's Slowing Earnings Growth Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest that Wall Street analysts expect BIDU to produce negative earnings growth until at least 2026 Advertising, Baidu's \"bread and butter,\" has been falling precipitously in recent quarters, and that decline is expected to continue. Below are some of the reasons for the company's tepid earnings growth, including: 1. Macroeconomic Challenges: China's economy has been plagued by a devasting recession for several years, intensified by COVID-19, declining population growth, and an unprecedented real estate bear market. 2. Changing Online Consumption: A trend has emerged where global internet users prefer short-form video content over long-form content. China's ByteDance (owner of TikTok, known as Douyin in China), is dominating the short-form video market domestically. Presently, Baidu does not have an answer to this competition, and its search-based advertising has taken a hit as a result. In the US, Meta Platforms has unveiled its \"Reels,\" while Google has debuted \"YouTube Shorts.\" 3. AI and Cloud Computing: Though Baidu has invested many resources in these businesses, the company has yet to bear fruit. Baidu's Troubling Price Action DeepSeek, China's alleged \"ChatGPT killer,\" threw cold water on US equities Monday. Though US stocks like Nvidiaand Microsoftplunged on the news, the action in Chinese equities was less than inspiring. For example, the iShares China Large Cap ETFgained less than a percent Monday \u2013 a tepid response if you believe China has flipped the AI game on its head overnight. In addition, BIDU is exhibiting relative weakness compared to other Chinese tech juggernauts like Alibabaand JD.com. Bottom Line Baidu faces significant challenges, from macro pressures in China to increasing competition in key markets like short-form video and AI. Slowing earnings growth and relative weakness in the tech sector underscore the uphill battle it faces in maintaining relevance.

While the promise of quick profits can be alluring, it is equally important to anchor your portfolio with stable, long-term investments. Rather than chasing after high-risk, high-reward stocks that often make headlines, investors should meticulously assess market dynamics and develop a well-thought-out investment strategy. The emphasis should be on well-established companies with a proven record and resilience to weather economic downturns.
