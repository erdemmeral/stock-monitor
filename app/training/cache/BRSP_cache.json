[{"text": "Salesforce upgraded, Southwest downgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls The Fly Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 5:33 PM 4 min read In This Article: SPOT Salesforce upgraded, Southwest downgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly. Top 5 Upgrades: BofA upgraded American Airlines (AAL) to Neutral from Underperform with a price target of $20, up from $12. American should benefit from the strong trends discussed by Delta (DAL) last week, including solid premium revenues, a build back of corporate travel, and growth on Atlantic route, BofA says. Citi upgraded Cloudflare (NET) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $145, up from $95. While there is \"clearly ample optimism already embedded in the stock,\" Citi has higher conviction on Cloudflare's ability to sustainably deliver 27%-30% annual revenue growth, the analyst tells investors in a research note. KeyBanc upgraded Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) to Overweight from Sector Weight. The firm is positioning itself for names leveraged to artificial intelligence-related devices and leading edge transitions like gate-all-around and technologies that support improving device performance, including backside power delivery and advanced packaging. TD Cowen upgraded Salesforce (CRM) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $400, up from $380. Following an end of 2024 rally amid Agentforce excitement,\" the shares have pulled back, \"creating a compelling entry point,\" the analyst tells investors in a research note. Barclays double upgraded Lumentum (LITE) to Overweight from Underweight with a price target of $125, up from $80. The firm says the combination of \"massive\" port count increases, combined with a strong desire to use a U.S. supply chain, have driven hyperscalers to \"qualify at an alarmingly fast rate.\" Top 5 Downgrades: Wolfe Research downgraded Spotify (SPOT) to Peer Perform from Outperform and removed the firm's prior $560 price target. Spotify offers a highly durable growth story with an improving ROIC profile and \"plenty of optionality,\" but revenue forecasts \"look full\" following price hikes, marketing cuts and developed markets beginning to saturate, the firm says. Given less exposure to corporate, premium, and international routes, BofA downgraded both Southwest (LUV) and JetBlue (JBLU) to Underperform from Neutral, arguing that both airlines trade at the high end of historical valuation ranges despite less exposure to \"the strongest industry trends.\" Evercore ISI downgraded Warby Parker (WRBY) to In Line from Outperform with a $23 price target. Shares have surged nearly 100% over the last four months and the firm finds the risk reward outlook to be \"less compelling at current levels,\" the analyst tells investors. Williams Trading downgraded Crocs (CROX) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $112, down from $127. Crocs trends are weakening and HEYDUDE trends remain weak and show \"no signs of improving,\" the analyst says. UBS downgraded Charles River (CRL) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $185, down from $250. The Neutral rating reflects a view that the company's mid-term sales growth has \"structurally decelerated,\" the analyst tells investors in a research note. Story Continues Top 5 Initiations: TD Cowen initiated coverage of ConocoPhillips (COP) with a Buy rating and $125 price target. The company's \"unique\" scale, inventory depth and synergy targets following the Marathon Oil acquisition close set the stage for ongoing sustainable improvements in capital efficiency, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Cantor Fitzgerald last night initiated coverage of 18 names in infrastructure and artificial intelligence software, with discussions suggesting that the value proposition of infrastructure software will increase, driven by the ongoing secular expansion of AI and generative AI, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Cantor's top ideas are MongoDB (MDB) , Oracle (ORCL) , and Monday.com (MNDY) . Alliance Global Partners initiated coverage of BrightSpire Capital (BRSP) with a Buy rating and $7.25 price target. The Buy rating is based on restart of new loan originations, a balance sheet with \"ample liquidity,\" a dividend yield of 11.2% and risk/reward the firm views as \"skewed to the upside\" at the current valuation, the analyst tells investors. UBS initiated coverage of Semtech (SMTC) with a Buy rating and $85 price target. UBS says the company's recent refinancing is not yet reflected in consensus and a possible portfolio rationalization \"could be the impetus for the market to reconsider Semtech's valuation.\" Stifel initiated coverage of Flutter Entertainment (FLUT) with a Buy rating and $320 price target. Consensus \"appears reasonable\" approaching initial FY25 guidance, says the firm.

\u2014 they\u2019re attractively valued and provide growth upside to boot TipRanks Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 8:46 AM 7 min read In This Article: FBRT BRSP After two years of strong stock market performance, Wall Street is generally optimistic about 2025. But there is always a contrarian view \u2013 and in this case, it\u2019s laid out by hedge manager Bill Smead, who points out that the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds remains high and continues to edge back toward 5% \u2013 a move he believes will dampen enthusiasm for stocks. Invest with Confidence: Follow TipRanks' Top Wall Street Analysts to uncover their success rate and average return. Join thousands of data-driven investors \u2013 Build your Smart Portfolio for personalized insights. Smead argues that this reflects the market\u2019s anticipation of persistent inflation and higher interest rates. In the second half of 2024, the Fed reduced interest rates by 1% to counter easing inflationary pressures. Yet, as Smead observes, inflation remains stubbornly high, with annualized rates creeping back toward 3%. While inflation may not surge as it did three years ago, its persistence above the Fed\u2019s 2% target creates pressure to maintain higher interest rates. Historically, elevated rates have weighed on stock performance, and Smead suggests this dynamic could disrupt the ongoing bull market. So, how should investors respond? While stocks remain resilient for now, there are prudent strategies to hedge against potential downturns. Dividend stocks, for instance, are a classic defensive play and a smart way to diversify a portfolio. Their regular payments provide a reliable income stream, while the best dividend payers offer power yields capable of boosting the overall return. Against this backdrop, we\u2019ve opened up the TipRanks database to uncover details on two dividend payers with yields of about 11%, which have recently garnered praise from analysts. What\u2019s more, according to the analysts, these stocks also offer double-digit upside potential. Here\u2019s a closer look at these income-generating opportunities. Franklin BSP Realty Trust (FBRT) We\u2019ll start with Franklin BSP Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust, or REIT. These companies exist to invest in real properties of all sorts, either through direct funding of loans or through the purchase of mortgage-backed securities. Franklin BSP works on the former model, providing or servicing loans in the commercial real estate sector. The company has built up a portfolio primarily composed of first mortgage loans on multifamily residential properties \u2013 that is, the company is a mortgage lender for apartment complexes. As of the end of last September, Franklin BSP\u2019s portfolio included 157 loans, with an average loan size of $33 million. Of this, 74% was collateralized by multifamily properties. The remainder was secured by other types of commercial real estate, although the company has minimal exposure to office properties, which make up only 4% of the portfolio. Franklin BSP\u2019s investments are mainly in senior mortgage loans, which account for 99% of the total; 95% of the portfolio loans are set at floating rates. The core portfolio principal balance at the end of 3Q24 was $5.2 billion. Story Continues This makes for big business. In the third quarter of 2024, the last period reported, Franklin BSP closed $380 million in new loan commitments and funded $325 million of principal balance. At the same time, the company received $510 million in loan payments. The company\u2019s approach to loan origination is to tailor loans to specific properties \u2013 although it does stick to a profile on first mortgage loans. That profile includes loan sizes between $10 million and $250 million; up to an 80% loan-to-value ratio; a 3- to 5-year term for transitional loans; and a 10-year term for stabilized loans. Franklin BSP will consider any commercial property type, although, as noted, the company does lean toward multifamily residential properties. A primary aim in Franklin BSP\u2019s activity is to generate a stable income for investors. Which brings us to the dividend. Franklin BSP last declared its dividend on December 16 and paid it out on January 10. The common share dividend was set at $0.355, marking the twelfth payment in a row at that rate. The dividend annualizes to $1.42 per common share and gives a robust forward yield of 11.2%. The company backs up its dividend with strong liquidity. Franklin BSP reported $1.1 billion in total liquidity at the end of 3Q24, of which $346 million was in cash and cash equivalents. This REIT has caught the eye of Janney analyst Jason Stewart, who is impressed by Franklin BSP\u2019s overall position. Stewart says of the company, describing that position: \u201cFBRT operates one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector, has world-class sponsorship, and a peer-leading track record through a challenging CRE lending market. The company\u2019s origination platform has led the sector in activity and sets the company apart from peers. Current vintage loans will produce cyclically high ROEs, and with 36% of the portfolio in 2023/2024 vintage originations, the company is in a unique position to capitalize on the dislocation in the CRE lending market. Over time, we expect required returns for best-in-class CRE mortgage REITs to trend back to historical averages in the 8% \u2013 9% range.\u201d These comments support the analyst\u2019s Buy rating, while his $16 price target implies a ~29% upside potential on the one-year horizon. Together with the dividend yield, the total one-year return here is potentially 40%. (To watch Stewart\u2019s track record, click here ) Overall, FBRT shares have a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 3 unanimously positive Wall Street reviews. The shares are priced at $12.44, and their $15.50 average price target price suggests that the stock will gain ~25% over the next 12 months. (See FBRT stock forecast ) BrightSpire Capital (BRSP) For the second stock on our list, we\u2019ll look at another REIT, BrightSpire Capital. This is an internally managed REIT, with a $739 million market cap and a focus on building a diverse portfolio of commercial real estate assets. The company believes in economies of scale, aiming to leverage that for a competitive advantage. Getting into details, BrightSpire has a portfolio worth approximately $3.9 billion, and comprised of 76 loans. The loan segment, consisting of senior and mezzanine loans, makes up 80% of the total portfolio. The remaining 20% is mainly composed of net lease and other real estate transactions. Of the properties in the portfolio, 41% are multifamily dwellings, and 38% are office properties. The remainder is mostly composed of industrial spaces, hotels, and mixed-use properties. Geographically, BrightSpire is active in the US, mainly in the West (43% of the portfolio) and Southwest (28% of the portfolio). The company has a presence in the Northeast, at 14% of the portfolio, and 6% of its properties are located in Europe. We should note that BrightSpire\u2019s revenues and earnings have been trending downward in recent quarters. In the last period reported, 3Q24, the company had a bottom line of $0.21 per share, by non-GAAP measures. While the year-ago figure was 28 cents per share, the 3Q24 number beat the forecast by 2 cents per share. Even though it was slipping, the company\u2019s earnings were sufficient to support the common share dividend. BrightSpire last declared the dividend payment on December 16, and paid it out on January 15. The 16-cent dividend annualizes to 11.2%. For analyst Gaurav Mehta, covering this REIT for Alliance Global, the key point here is potential. He believes that BrightSpire is well-positioned to deliver improved results going forward, and that the dividend is a clear advantage. Mehta writes of the company, \u201cOur Buy rating is based on restart of new loan originations, management\u2019s focus on resolving watch list loans and REO assets, balance sheet with ample liquidity and a dividend yield of 11.2%. At the current valuation, we believe that risk/reward is skewed to the upside.\u201d Quantifying his stance, Mehta puts a Buy rating on BRSP shares, with a $7.25 price target that suggests the stock will gain ~30% in the next 12 months. With the dividend yield added in, that upside can reach 41%. (To watch Mehta\u2019s track record, click here ) There are 6 recent analyst reviews on file for BRPS shares, with a 4-to-2 split favoring Buy over Hold to give the stock its Moderate Buy consensus rating. The shares are currently trading for $5.59, and their $7.60 average price target, even more bullish than the Alliance Global view, points toward a gain of ~36% by early next year.

BrightSpire Capital (NYSE:BRSP) have lost 32%, as stock drops 6.6% this past week editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Thu, Dec 19, 2024, 8:14 PM 3 min read In This Article: BRSP For many, the main point of investing is to generate higher returns than the overall market. But every investor is virtually certain to have both over-performing and under-performing stocks. So we wouldn't blame long term BrightSpire Capital, Inc. ( NYSE:BRSP ) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 56% over a half decade. And the share price decline continued over the last week, dropping some 6.6%. However, this move may have been influenced by the broader market, which fell 4.0% in that time. Since BrightSpire Capital has shed US$54m from its value in the past 7 days, let's see if the longer term decline has been driven by the business' economics. See our latest analysis for BrightSpire Capital Because BrightSpire Capital made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually desire strong revenue growth. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one would hope for good top-line growth to make up for the lack of earnings. In the last five years BrightSpire Capital saw its revenue shrink by 6.9% per year. While far from catastrophic that is not good. The share price decline of 9% compound, over five years, is understandable given the company is losing money, and revenue is moving in the wrong direction. We don't think anyone is rushing to buy this stock. Ultimately, it may be worth watching - should revenue pick up, the share price might follow. The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). NYSE:BRSP Earnings and Revenue Growth December 19th 2024 You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic . What About Dividends? As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, BrightSpire Capital's TSR for the last 5 years was -32%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return. A Different Perspective Investors in BrightSpire Capital had a tough year, with a total loss of 11% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 26%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 6% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should \"buy when there is blood on the streets\", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" or \"potential\" or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases which are predictions of or indicate future events or trends and which do not relate solely to historical matters. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, and may cause actual results to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. Among others, the following uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements: operating costs and business disruption may be greater than expected; uncertainties regarding the ongoing impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and its adverse impact on the real estate market, the economy and the Company\u2019s investments, financial condition and business operation; the Company's operating results may differ materially from the information presented in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as well as in the Company\u2019s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; the fair value of the Company's investments may be subject to uncertainties (including impacts associated with accelerating inflationary trends, recent and potential further interest rate increases, the volatility of interest rates, credit spreads and the transition from LIBOR to SOFR, increased market volatility affecting commercial real estate businesses and public securities); the Company's use of leverage and interest rate mismatches between the Company\u2019s assets and borrowings could hinder its ability to make distributions and may significantly impact its liquidity position; the ability to simplify the portfolio, realize substantial efficiencies as well as anticipated strategic and financial benefits, including, but not limited to expected cost savings through the internalization or expected returns on equity and/or yields on investments; the timing of and ability to generate additional liquidity and deploy available liquidity, including in senior mortgage loans; whether the Company will achieve its anticipated Distributable Earnings per share (as adjusted), or maintain or produce higher Distributable Earnings per share (as adjusted) in the near term or ever; the Company\u2019s ability to maintain or grow the dividend at all in the future; defaults by borrowers in paying debt service on outstanding indebtedness; borrowers\u2019 abilities to manage and stabilize properties; deterioration in the performance of the properties securing our investments (including the impact of higher interest expense, depletion of interest and other reserves or payment-in-kind concessions in lieu of current interest payment obligations, population shifts and migration, reduced demand for office, multifamily, hospitality or retail space) that may cause deterioration in the performance of our investments and, potentially, principal losses to us; adverse impacts on the Company's corporate revolver, including covenant compliance and borrowing base capacity; adverse impacts on the Company's liquidity, including available capacity under and margin calls on master repurchase facilities; lease payment defaults or deferrals, demands for protective advances and capital expenditures; the ability of the Company to refinance certain mortgage debt on similar terms to those currently existing or at all; the ability to execute CRE CLO\u2019s on a go forward basis, including at a reduced cost of capital; the impact of legislative, regulatory, tax and competitive changes, regime changes and the actions of government authorities and in particular those affecting the commercial real estate finance and mortgage industry or our business; and the impact of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, global trade tensions, and the implementation and expansion of economic and trade sanctions. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. Additional information about these and other factors can be found in Part I, Item 1A of the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as well as in BrightSpire Capital\u2019s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Moreover, each of the factors referenced above are likely to also be impacted directly or indirectly by the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and investors are cautioned to interpret substantially all of such statements and risks as being heightened as a result of the ongoing impact of the COVID-19.
