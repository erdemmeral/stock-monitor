Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our 9 Best Market-Beating Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

respectable 91% return over the last year editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 1:22 PM 2 min read In This Article: EHTH -2.82% Passive investing in index funds can generate returns that roughly match the overall market. But one can do better than that by picking better than average stocks (as part of a diversified portfolio). For example, the eHealth, Inc. ( NASDAQ:EHTH ) share price is up 91% in the last 1 year, clearly besting the market return of around 25% (not including dividends). If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term, investors will do very well! On the other hand, longer term shareholders have had a tougher run, with the stock falling 49% in three years. So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. See our latest analysis for eHealth Because eHealth made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit. eHealth grew its revenue by 16% last year. That's a fairly respectable growth rate. While the share price performed well, gaining 91% over twelve months, you could argue the revenue growth warranted it. If revenue stays on trend, there may be plenty more share price gains to come. But before deciding this growth stock is underappreciated, you might want to check out profitability trends (and cash flow) You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). NasdaqGS:EHTH Earnings and Revenue Growth January 24th 2025 We consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free report showing analyst forecasts should help you form a view on eHealth A Different Perspective It's good to see that eHealth has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 91% in the last twelve months. Notably the five-year annualised TSR loss of 14% per year compares very unfavourably with the recent share price performance. The long term loss makes us cautious, but the short term TSR gain certainly hints at a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the 3 warning signs we've spotted with eHealth . Story Continues eHealth is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find lesser know companies this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.

Inc. (NASDAQ:EHTH) institutional owners after losing 15% over the past year editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Tue, Dec 24, 2024, 5:12 PM 4 min read In This Article: EHTH -2.82% Key Insights Institutions' substantial holdings in eHealth implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price The top 16 shareholders own 51% of the company Insiders have sold recently Every investor in eHealth, Inc. ( NASDAQ:EHTH ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 39% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Institutional investors would appreciate the 45% increase in share price last week, given their one-year losses have totalled a disappointing 15%. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about eHealth. Check out our latest analysis for eHealth NasdaqGS:EHTH Ownership Breakdown December 24th 2024 What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About eHealth? Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in eHealth. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see eHealth's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. NasdaqGS:EHTH Earnings and Revenue Growth December 24th 2024 Our data indicates that hedge funds own 22% of eHealth. That catches my attention because hedge funds sometimes try to influence management, or bring about changes that will create near term value for shareholders. 8 Knots Management, LLC is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.1% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.9% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.5% by the third-largest shareholder. Additionally, the company's CEO Francis Soistman directly holds 1.9% of the total shares outstanding. A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 16 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too. Story Continues Insider Ownership Of eHealth While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. We can report that insiders do own shares in eHealth, Inc.. In their own names, insiders own US$12m worth of stock in the US$247m company. It is good to see some investment by insiders, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public Ownership With a 34% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over eHealth. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders. Next Steps: It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand eHealth better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - eHealth has 4 warning signs we think you should be aware of. If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

{"text": "eHealth, Inc. Updates Guidance for Fiscal Year 2024 Following Strong AEP Performance PR Newswire Tue, Dec 17, 2024, 4:00 PM 12 min read In This Article: EHTH -2.82% AUSTIN, Texas , Dec. 17, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- eHealth, Inc. (Nasdaq: EHTH), a leading private online health insurance marketplace, today provided commentary on its Annual Enrollment Period (AEP) performance and updated guidance ranges for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 . \"This dynamic enrollment period was marked by significant changes to Medicare Advantage and Part D plan offerings, creating an increased demand for the trusted, carrier-agnostic solutions that eHealth provides to help beneficiaries navigate their coverage options. eHealth's outperformance during this critical time is a testament to the success of our extensive transformation initiatives and the organization's tremendous AEP preparedness effort,\" said Fran Soistman , Chief Executive Officer of eHealth. Continued Fran Soistman , \"During the AEP, we drove strong consumer demand to our omnichannel platform coupled with conversion rates that exceeded our expectations, allowing us to deliver substantial enrollment growth at enhanced margins. Most importantly, we continued to execute on our mission, assisting hundreds of thousands of Medicare beneficiaries in evaluating their health coverage and either enrolling in a new plan or determining that their existing coverage remains the best option for their needs. I am proud of the eHealth team and believe we are in the early stages of capturing the exciting opportunities for scale, margin expansion and brand advancement in our Medicare business.\" AEP Operational Highlights Strong year-over-year growth in submitted Medicare applications including significant outperformance within direct marketing channels. All-time high AEP submitted application volume in the online unassisted category. Telephonic and online conversion rates above expectations and representing meaningful year-over-year improvement. Expansion in LTV-to-CAC ratio (1) in the Medicare business. Successful implementation of eHealth's new comprehensive member retention program driving consumers to return to the eHealth platform to review their coverage and shop for healthcare plans. Updated 2024 Guidance Based on information available as of December 17, 2024 , eHealth is revising its guidance ranges for the full year ending December 31, 2024 . Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $500.0 million to $520.0 million compared to the prior range of $470.0 million to $495.0 million . GAAP net income (loss) is expected to be in the range of $(12.0) million to $3.0 million compared to the prior range of $(36.5) million to $(22.0) million . Adjusted EBITDA (2) is expected to be in the range of $40.0 million to $55.0 million compared to the prior range of $7.5 million to $25.0 million . Story Continues The above guidance includes the expected impact of positive net adjustment revenue in the range of $14.0 million to $20.0 million . Operating cash flow is expected to be in the range of $(15.0) million to $(5.0) million compared to the prior range of $(10.0) million to $0.0 million . The change in operating cash flow outlook reflects eHealth's investment in profitable Medicare enrollment growth during the fourth quarter. Said John Dolan , Chief Financial Officer of eHealth, \"The mid-point of our updated guidance ranges implies a substantial expansion of our margins \u2013 an important accomplishment for the company. We also believe the\u00a0AEP cohort we enrolled this year will drive attractive cash ROI. Our revised operating cash flow guidance reflects greater than expected\u00a0AEP enrollment volume and associated acquisition spend. As a reminder, we recognize revenue upon plan approval, and member acquisition costs are expensed and paid upfront, while we do not receive initial commission payments for most new policies until the first quarter. Our guidance is reflective of this timing dynamic within our Medicare agency fulfillment model.\" These expectations are forward-looking statements, and\u00a0eHealth assumes no obligation to update these statements. Actual results may be materially different and are affected by the risks and uncertainties identified in this press release and in eHealth's annual and quarterly reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Footnotes to Certain Operational and Non -GAAP Financial Information (1) LTV-to-CAC ratio is calculated as constrained lifetime value of commissions per Medicare Advantage (\"MA\")-equivalent approved member for which we are the broker of record divided by total acquisition cost (including customer care and enrollment and variable marketing costs) per MA-equivalent approved member. The number of MA-equivalent approved members is calculated by adding the total number of approved Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement members and 25% of the total number of approved Medicare Part D members during the period presented. (2) This press release includes Adjusted EBITDA, a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding dividends for preferred stock and change in preferred stock redemption value (together the \"impact from preferred stock\"), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, impairment, restructuring and other charges, interest expense, other income (expense), net, and other non-recurring charges from GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders. Other non-recurring charges to GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders may include transaction expenses in connection with capital raising transactions (whether debt, equity or equity-linked) and acquisitions, whether or not consummated, purchase price adjustments and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles. eHealth believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to eHealth's financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that the use of Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency and comparability with eHealth's past financial reports. Management also believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional measure of eHealth's operating results and facilitates comparisons of eHealth's core operating performance against prior periods and business model objectives. This information is provided to investors in order to facilitate additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate eHealth's ongoing operations. eHealth believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in their assessment of eHealth's operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, and should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations in that it does not reflect all of the revenue and costs associated with the operations of eHealth's business and does not reflect income tax as determined in accordance with GAAP. As a result, you should not consider this measure in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of eHealth's results as reported under GAAP. eHealth expects to continue to incur the stock-based compensation costs, depreciation and amortization and interest expense as described above, and exclusion of these costs, and their related income tax benefits, from Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual or infrequent. eHealth compensates for these limitations by prominently disclosing GAAP net income (loss) and providing investors with a reconciliation from eHealth's GAAP net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the relevant periods. The accompanying table provides more details on guidance GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, and the related reconciliation between these financial measures.

Reports Q3 Loss, Tops Revenue Estimates Zacks Equity Research Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 4:45 PM 3 min read In This Article: EHTH -2.82% EHealth (EHTH) came out with a quarterly loss of $1.86 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.13. This compares to loss of $1.54 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -64.60%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this provider of internet-based heath insurance agency services would post a loss of $0.71 per share when it actually produced a loss of $1.09, delivering a surprise of -53.52%. Over the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates. eHealth , which belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry, posted revenues of $58.41 million for the quarter ended September 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.13%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $64.72 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. EHealth shares have lost about 41.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 21.2%. What's Next for eHealth? While eHealth has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for eHealth: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.05 on $266.48 million in revenues for the coming quarter and -$0.87 on $483.64 million in revenues for the current fiscal year. Story Continues Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Insurance - Brokerage is currently in the top 34% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

(NASDAQ:EHTH) Misses Q3 Revenue Estimates, But Stock Soars 7.8% Online health insurance comparison site eHealth (NASDAQ:EHTH) met Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q3 CY2024, but sales fell 9.7% year on year to $58.41 million. On the other hand, the company\u2019s outlook for the full year was close to analysts\u2019 estimates with revenue guided to $482.5 million at the midpoint. Its GAAP loss of $1.83 per share was 20.3% below analysts\u2019 consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy eHealth? Find out in our full research report . eHealth (EHTH) Q3 CY2024 Highlights: Revenue: $58.41 million vs analyst estimates of $58.86 million (in line) EPS: -$1.83 vs analyst expectations of -$1.52 (20.3% miss) EBITDA: -$34.83 million vs analyst estimates of -$34.99 million (small beat) The company reconfirmed its revenue guidance for the full year of $482.5 million at the midpoint EBITDA guidance for the full year is $16.25 million at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $17.14 million Operating Margin: -74%, down from -60.9% in the same quarter last year EBITDA Margin: -59.6%, down from -43.4% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow was -$33.47 million compared to -$35.04 million in the previous quarter Estimated Membership: 1.16 million Market Capitalization: $149.7 million Company Overview Aiming to address a high-stakes and often confusing decision, eHealth (NASDAQ:EHTH) guides consumers through health insurance enrollment and related topics. Online Marketplace Marketplaces have existed for centuries. Where once it was a main street in a small town or a mall in the suburbs, sellers benefitted from proximity to one another because they could draw customers by offering convenience and selection. Today, a myriad of online marketplaces fulfill that same role, aggregating large customer bases, which attracts commission-paying sellers, generating flywheel scale effects that feed back into further customer acquisition. Sales Growth A company\u2019s long-term performance can indicate its business quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Over the last three years, eHealth\u2019s revenue declined by 7.5% per year. This shows demand was weak, a rough starting point for our analysis. eHealth Total Revenue This quarter, eHealth reported a rather uninspiring 9.7% year-on-year revenue decline to $58.41 million of revenue, in line with Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 3.2% over the next 12 months, an acceleration versus the last three years. Although this projection illustrates the market thinks its newer products and services will catalyze better performance, it is still below the sector average. Story Continues Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link . Revenue Per User Average revenue per user (ARPU) is a critical metric to track for consumer internet businesses like eHealth because it measures how much the company earns in transaction fees from each user. ARPU also gives us unique insights into a user\u2019s average order size and eHealth\u2019s take rate, or \"cut\", on each order. eHealth\u2019s ARPU fell over the last two years, averaging 18.9% annual declines. This raises questions about its ability to engage users and signals its platform\u2019s value is eroding. eHealth ARPU Key Takeaways from eHealth\u2019s Q3 Results We struggled to find many strong positives in these results as its EPS missed analysts' expectations and its full-year EBITDA guidance fell short. Overall, this quarter could have been better, but the stock traded up 7.8% to $5.50 immediately after reporting. This could be due to Donald Trump winning the presidential election and investors making speculative bets on small-cap companies as they go \"risk-on\". Should you buy the stock or not? When making that decision, it\u2019s important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

(Nasdaq: EHTH) (ehealth.com), a leading online private health insurance marketplace, announced today that the company's new brand identity, which is transforming how the industry markets to Medicare beneficiaries, has been selected by Modern Healthcare and Ad Age as a winner of a 2024 Silver Healthcare Marketing Impact Award for Integrated Campaign of the Year. The Healthcare Marketing Impact Awards recognizes outstanding marketing, advertising, and communication campaigns across all media platforms. These campaigns advance the goals of healthcare organizations, promoting individual and community health. \"From the outset, consumers told us that industry advertising, which featured similar spokespeople and urgent sales pitches, was unhelpful, confusing and stressful,\" said Michelle Barbeau , Chief Revenue Officer for eHealth. \"We realized there was an opportunity to demonstrate how eHealth\u00a0could be the light at end of the tunnel as beneficiaries' remarkably transparent advisor and licensed agency because we're a free service with no obligation to enroll that compares plans from top insurers either online or\u00a0with unbiased advisors, who are paid the same no matter what Medicare plan beneficiaries select.\u00a0That's how 'eHealth, Your Medicare Matchmaker' was born.\" A key highlight of eHealth's rebranding efforts, developed in collaboration with Shinebox , is the use of real-life beneficiaries in entirely unscripted television advertisements using eHealth's services with the company's real licensed advisors and ecommerce site to compare Medicare plans in one place and save on premiums and out-of-pocket costs. \"A year later, our bold risk to stand out from the Medicare marketing crowd has paid off, as we've doubled brand awareness and driven significant growth in calls and website traffic, and lowered acquisition costs,\" Barbeau said. \"It is safe to say eHealth has changed the industry narrative from focusing on fear, uncertainty, and doubt to a focus on doing what's best for customers.\" About eHealth (NASDAQ: EHTH) We're Matchmakers. For over 25 years, eHealth has helped millions of Americans find the healthcare coverage that fits their needs at a price they can afford. As a leading independent licensed insurance agency and advisor, eHealth offers access to over 180 health insurers, including national and regional companies.

In the third quarter, eHealth achieved our revenue and profitability targets, delivered significant growth in Medicare application volume and completed final preparations for the annual enrollment period. We successfully scaled and trained our agent force, finalized our brand driven marketing materials and made further enhancements to the online consumer experience. We also entered this critical selling season with a pipeline of appointments for new and existing members that was materially larger than it was at the same time last year, we maintained a strong momentum in the first weeks of the AP with call volume and online visits to our platform up meaningfully year over year. The early indicators also point to increased effectiveness of our Telesales Organization as we are converting demand at greater rates compared to a year ago, we stand ready to assist our existing members to ensure they continue to be enrolled in plans that best fit their needs. We are pleased with these early results while recognizing that much of our AEP performance rides in the final weeks and even days of AEP before I review our third quarter operational highlights. It is worth reemphasizing the differentiated value proposition that E health brings to our carrier partners and beneficiaries on the carrier side. E health delivers quality enrollment volume at scale across our agency and amplify fulfillment models. We supplement these standout capabilities with local market focus and access to actionable data on how carrier plans perform against their peers and which plan features are especially important to beneficiaries as they select coverage for beneficiaries we offer among the broadest selection of plans relative to our peers. While remaining truly carrier agnostic. We are also differentiated in our delivery of exceptional customer experience. E health expert teams of licensed benefit advisers and rich suite of omni channel enrollment tools including our unique end to end online enrollment engine, provide our customers guidance through a complex and high stakes plan selection process in a pressure free environment with respect to the broader Medicare advantage environment. Some of the key trends we have highlighted over the course of this year are clearly materializing. We've seen meaningful changes in plan benefits and star ratings as well as changes in carrier strategies that are becoming increasingly market and product specific. Our choice model is especially important during a dynamic enrollment period such as this one e health performance is not tied to any specific carrier. And our key objective is to match each customer with the best possible coverage from the wide selection of national and regional plans. We offer our value proposition as a trusted unbiased advisor is resonating with beneficiaries as they evaluate their coverage options as a with an expected increase in consumer shopping. We believe we are well positioned to take market share in an industry with decreasing competitive capacity. At the same time, this environment also necessitates a focus on protecting our existing Book of Business. To that end, we have introduced several adviser and technology driven retention initiatives which I will describe shortly moving now to our annual enrollment period preparations. In 2023 we launched our rebranding strategy and the integrated marketing campaign. Your Medicare matchmaker. These initiatives centered around our customers and delivered significant uplift to our direct channels. Last AP this year, we have built on this initial success across every touch point. Our materials reinforce our value proposition while also layering in new messaging that acknowledges the specifics of this enrollment period and highlights our real advisers as consumers unbiased transparent Medicare matchmakers. During the AP, we plan to continue growing our key direct branded channels while remaining agile in terms of geographic and channel based marketing dollar deployments. We're also placing increased emphasis on lead nurturing to better monetize the significant call volume and online traffic that we are seeing on our platform. We expect this integrated marketing strategy to drive better quality and higher converting leads as well as greater brand recognition and loyalty from the members. We enroll further. Our local market approach is especially relevant to say as carriers have telegraphed, they will be precise in the marketing and benefit structure strategies. In support of that, we have launched messaging targeting areas that are experiencing the most planned disruption year over year. Another important area of focus ahead of the AP was positioning ourselves for greater conversion rates across our omni channel enrollment platform. The call center side, we successfully reached our hiring goals with an adviser mix that is more tenured relative to last year. Additionally, in Q3, our 1st year license advisers performed better than the equivalent classes in Q3 of last year driven by enhanced training protocols and new agent facing sales tools. This AP we're employing a larger number of screeners than we have in the past. Screeners conduct a preliminary needs assessment and ensure callers are routed to an appropriate licensed agent or our customer service team dedicated to helping existing members. This function improves customer experience by reducing hold times and enhances the efficiency of our licensed advisers to screen calls, convert a significantly higher rates than on screen calls on our online platform. We continue to advance the personalization and simplicity of the E health digital consumer experience with a EP we expect to benefit from our differentiated tech enabled features such as match monitor, live advise, which is our one way video enrollment experience, license, agent chat, co browsing our proprietary plan recommendation tool and others. Ehealth was a pioneer and remains a leader in digital consumer experience when it comes to shopping for and enrolling into health insurance. Given the significant amount of shopping that we anticipate and the back end loaded nature of the A EP. Our end to end online capabilities represent a significant advantage in absorbing peaks and consumer demand. Instead of waiting on hold an industry wide phenomenon that is typical during the last days of any AP what could be especially pronounced this year, customers can transact on our platform right away using the same plan recommendation engine available to our licensed agents. Ultimately, we are ready to serve customers through the enrollment channel that best matches their preference, whether by phone or online or hybrid and believe we are well positioned to efficiently convert within a wide range of demand patterns. I also want to highlight our retention strategy with significant plan changes underway. We are laser focused on engaging ehealth customers to ensure their plans fit their individual health and financial needs. In addition to carrying a dedicated team of agents to take calls from existing e health members. We are proactively reaching out to current members whose coverage might be changing. Our goal is for beneficiaries to feel supported, heard and empowered to make the right decision for their unique circumstances. Using our data models, we identify members who will be impacted by the upcoming changes and invite them to use our self service tool match monitor. This new tool summarizes lengthy and often confusing annual notice of change or an to create a concise summary of key plan changes and features match monitor also provides a short list of alternative plans recommended by our proprietary algorithm and compares these plans side by side versus the beneficiary's current coverage to date. We've seen a strong response to the outreach. We have done turning to amplify our new and growing carrier dedicated fulfillment model and an important area of diversification. We expect amplify will play an important role during a ep supplementing our core agency business with attractive margin and cash payback cycles. Carriers choose amplify because of our high level of service, strong conversion rates and the deep expertise of our adviser base in the lead up to the fourth quarter. We implemented learnings from last AP to deliver even better performance for our carrier partners and their customers. We believe this model offers broad potential for expansion in 2025 and 26 as we continue to add new partners and grow within our existing dedicated arrangements. Last month, we reached an important milestone, obtaining high trust certification, a globally recognized certification that demonstrates an organization's compliance with rigorous security and privacy requirements. Many carriers require that their BP O partners are high trust certified in order to serve as an extension of their internal telesales operations. And this achievement widens the universal potential amplify customers. Furthermore, last month, we also announced our certification from great place to work. A global leader in workplace culture recognition. This certification was based entirely on information gathered from our current employees about their experience working for. We see it as a key indicator of the success of our completed business transformation. We know that company culture supports business performance and are deeply proud of this important achievement as a whole. We are seeing the fruits of the operational cultural and technological improvements. I've been discussing in the third quarter. Medicare Advantage submitted applications across both of our fulfillment models grew 46% year over year total. Medicare submitted applications including medsup and prescription drug plans grew 43% excluding tail revenue in both periods. Third quarter revenue grew 9% year over year accompanied by improvement in adjusted EBITA and GAAP earnings on the same basis. Outside of the Medicare supplement market represents an important option for seniors in areas without robust ma plan offerings as well as for specific socioeconomic audiences. Medicare supplement could also gain greater adoption in markets where carriers have scaled back their benefits this year. As ehealth has focused broadly on Medicare advantage distribution over the past several years, we've not made corresponding investments in our medsup business. This is now changing. Given that medsup can be sold year round. We believe it to be an attractive complementary business area for us. This year, we've introduced a dedicated medsup sales team, expanded our carrier options and are optimizing our marketing strategies to reach this distinct audience more effectively. During the third quarter, we also launched an end to end online enrollment experience for medsup customers and offering that we plan to expand next year with respect to our balance sheet. We recently reached an agreement with our term lender blue torch to extend the maturity of our $70 million loan by one year under slightly more favorable terms which could further improve depending on the interest rate environment. We continue to work with our advisers towards improving the overall capital structure of our business. In our view, the company has more than sufficient liquidity to continue executing on our strategy in 2025 and 2026 which provides us leverage as we assess our options. In conclusion, I believe this team has positioned e help for another successful. I am proud of all the effort and cross functional collaboration, which went into this process. Last day, we returned to enrollment growth on a profitable foundation after rebuilding our sales and marketing functions and enacting a comprehensive cost transformation program. We are now prepared to build on these achievements by delivering above market ma enrollment growth while maintaining enterprise wide cost discipline and focus on cash flow generation. With three weeks of AP completed. We've gotten off to a strong start both in terms of enrollment volume and with respect to our multi faceted plan to serve e health existing members. We look forward to updating you on our full AP performance during our Q4 earnings call. We will also be meeting with investors at the upcoming U BS health care conference in Southern California. Next week. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO John Stelbon, John. Story Continues John Stelben Thank you, Francis and good morning everyone. I'm excited to have my first earnings call be one where we discuss our continued strong momentum which is reflected in our third quarter results. Our third quarter, financial results were driven by strong execution in our Medicare business and continued improvements in our cost structure. They also reflect our investments in a preparedness a major part of our third quarter operations. Third quarter revenue excluding net adjustment revenue or tail was $57.2 million. An increase of 9% year over year triggered primarily by strong Medicare enrollments and partially offset by a decline in our employer and individual revenue. Third quarter tail revenue was $1.2 million as compared to $12.2 million in Q3 of 2023 including tail revenue. Third quarter revenue was $58.4 million or a 10% decrease year over year. Medicare segment revenue excluding sale revenue grew 13% year over year including tail revenue. Our Medicare segment generated $53.2 million in revenue compared to $55.5 million in Q3 of 2023. During the quarter, we recognized $1.1 million in positive sale revenue from our Medicare segment compared to $9.3 million a year ago. We also saw a year over year improvement of $5.6 million in Medicare submit profitability excluding sale revenue driven primarily by increased application volume and favorable member acquisition costs including sale revenue. Medicare segment loss was $17.9 million. Reflecting our investment in hiring and training Medicare advisors for our agency and carrier dedicated platforms ahead of the significant shopping volume. We anticipate this AEP as a reminder within our Medicare segment, we generate two different types of enrollments between agency and amplified fulfillment models for virtually all of our agency enrollments. Ehealth is the broker of record resulting in commission revenue that is booked based on constrained lifetime value estimates at the time of approval and cash collected over the lifetime of the policy. Amplify our carrier dedicated model, generates a combination of broker record and fee based enrollments for fee based enrollment. E health does not become the broker record. Instead carriers pay us a one time success fee for each enrollment. In addition to ongoing payments to support dedicated sales teams as we ramp our fee based business, it is expected to drive growth in other revenues but will not impact our approved membership metrics across both fulfillment platforms. Ehealth drove a 22% increase in Medicare submissions year over year. Medicare advantage submissions grew 26%. Medicare supplement submitted applications grew 5% year over year. While standalone prescription drug plan volume continued to decline reflecting broader market dynamics. As I mentioned, some of that volume is reflected in our reported approved members. While enrollments transacted under fee based arrangements within amplify flow through other revenue, which grew 36% year over year. Total acquisition costs per approved Medicare member improved 16% year over year, reflecting a 24% decrease in aging costs and a 4% decrease in marketing costs per approved member as a reminder. 2nd and 3rd quarters are characterized by higher variable costs per approved member relative to Q4 and Q1. As we start to prepare our sales and marketing organization for the upcoming annual enrollment period. This investment is spread over seasonally low enrollment volumes but is already yielding an attractive return for us in the fourth quarter. Medicare advantage lifetime value $909 roughly flat with last year's persistency on our Medicare Advantage book of business on a trailing 12 month basis was in line with our expectations and also in line with last year's observations. As Fran describes member retention is an important area of our operations and is especially critical during this AEP when some beneficiaries will experience significant changes to their coverage in this environment. We remain confident in our commissions receivable assets. As mentioned on previous calls, we regularly assess whether changes in assumptions or evolving trends will result in a change in the estimate of expected cash collections. We only recognize positive adjustments to revenue when it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur as such. There are significant positive adjustments that have not yet been recognized, including but not limited to our initial constraints in our employer and individual segment revenue was $5.2 million with a segment loss of 800,000. This compares to segment revenue of $9.2 million and a segment of profit of $4.8 million in Q3 of 2023. The year over year decline in segment revenue and profit primarily reflect $2.8 million in lower tail revenue. Group members also decline off a low base as this business unit continues to undergo transformation. Moving to our operating expenses, Non GAAP technology and content expense declined 4% and Non-GAAP general administrative expense declined 8% compared to Q3 2023. This was driven by our targeted cost reduction including additional office closures in the first half of the year in line with our remote first model with respect to variable costs. Nongaap customer care and enrollment increased 2% year over year and Nongaap marketing and advertising increased 3% year over year. Well below the rate of growth in our Medicare submissions, Q3 GAAP net loss $42.5 million compared to $37 million in Q3 of 2023 adjusted EBITA excluding T revenue with negative $36 million, an improvement of $4.3 million compared to Q3 a year ago, including sale revenue adjusted even though was negative $34.8 million compared to negative $28.1 million last year operating cash flow was negative $29.3 million compared to negative $24.7 million in Q3 of 2023. Driven by the timing of certain cash receipts and cash compensation dynamics. As we carried a larger advisor account this quarter than a year ago, moving to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $117.8 million in cash equivalents and short term marketable securities. This compares to $160.6 million. At the end of Q3 2023. His friend mentioned we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operational needs for 2025 and 2026. We ended the quarter with total commissions receivable balance of $814 million, which compares to $780.6 million at the same time last year, this year, over year increase reflects the continued growth we have generated in our broker of record application volume, as well as the positive adjustments we have recognized over the past year net cash collections as a reminder fee based enrollments transacted on our Amplify platform, do not increase our conditions receivable balance. Given that we are paid a one time success fee. These enrollments are characterized by more favorable cash flow timing relative to our agency business. As grand noted, we continue to work with our advisers towards the longer term solution for improving our overall capital structure of our business. In conclusion, we are pleased with our third quarter financial results and the early read of the AEP data. While we've had a very strong start to the AP the most critical weeks of the selling season remain ahead of us as such. We are reiterating the 2024 Dods ranges that we provided as part of second quarter earnings. You can reference our guidance for the third quarter earnings release and slides posted on the industrial relations section of our website. I look forward to connecting with our investors and analysts during the follow up calls and now operator, please open the line to questions. Question and Answer Session Operator Certainly at this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press Star one on your telephone keypad. You may withdraw your question at any time by pressing Star Two. Once again, that is star one for your questions. We'll pause a moment to allow any questions to queue and we will take our first question from George Sutton with Craig Hallum. Please go ahead. George Sutton Thank you John, welcome to your first call and your first AP. So I'm curious Fran, if you could quantify a little bit, what you're referencing in terms of the larger pipeline early in the AP and also your ability or what you're seeing in terms of the converting that demand. It, what you're saying is a greater rate than a year ago. Just curious if we can get a little more detail on those. Francis Soistman Good morning George. Thanks for the question, the pipeline, we built the pipeline in 2023 but we put it on steroids this year and we have greater visibility obviously with the degree of changes that are occurring where either beneficiaries were losing their current Medicare Advantage organization because of a market exit or service area reduction. Or their plan was withdrawn. We saw, you know, a number of PPO plans that have been withdrawn in, in different parts of the country. So we know those folks have to make change, they don't have an option and we, we certainly don't want them to enter January without having health insurance coverage. So we went on offense. We, you know, to the extent that we had email addresses, phone numbers we started a very robust outreach program. And we didn't give up on the first call, the second call, third call, we continued to dial and make other efforts to, to outreach that has provided us with an opportunity to hit the ground running on October 15th. So we were able to begin taking care of those needs right out of the gate. So I applaud the team for outstanding execution. As far as more specifics on, I'm not going to provide you a metric. We'll have to, you'll have to bear with us until we complete the A EP and prepare to announce Q4 earnings. But, you know, we had a very significant growth last year. And in the first three weeks of the A EP, we have not only surpassed our internal forecast in a meaningful way but certainly also a very high base. So again, we're looking at this holistically in terms of our retention and new opportunities, you know, millions of people, current Medicare advantage members were affected by plan withdrawals and service area reduction. So I think there is a greater sense of urgency, higher motivation for Medicare advantage, beneficiaries to shop this year. So we're being opportunistic in meeting those needs, both for retention and with new opportunities. George Sutton So it's particularly encouraging, given what I would have thought early in the season was going to be limited ability to get in front of people, given all the political advertising. I'm just curious the rest of the season relative to changes in advertising you might be doing. I'm curious if I'll see a lot more of ease for the rest of the season. And, would you expect that the AP could get extended? Francis Soistman Okay, let me break those down. You have three very good questions there. As far as the concerns with the national election that we, you know, the industry would have difficulty getting that message through. We've not experienced that particularly with our Dr TV. People have been glued to the TV. S over the last few weeks and, you know, leading up to last night's conclusions or August to say early this morning's conclusions. We buy our Dr TV on a national basis. A lot of the political messaging advertisements are done on a local market basis. So we were able to get our message across if you tuned into, you know, CNN box you know we make sure we represent both sides of the aisle and our outreach is you would have seen us those messages. We, we all get calls from our family members when they see us on TV. So we know people are watching all of our channels right now are performing above our expectations leading to lower coas a higher conversion rate. So we're generating quality leads. That's really, you know, it, it's success to get success and it invokes more confidence with particularly our less tenured agents. You know they're enjoying success in closing customers which I think is going to serve us well for the balance of AP and into January is always, I can't tell you anything new as far as whether, you know, C MS will grant an extension or offer a special enrollment period. I stayed reasonably close contact with a few people at C MS. I'll be outreaching to them in a follow up to a meeting we had in person a few weeks back, just giving them some, some metrics in terms of what we're observing. And we have a very transparent relationship with C MS and it's not uncommon for them to either confirm that they're seeing similar kinds of higher volumes with their calls, call center. So, my guess though, George and I don't have any inside information, but my prediction would be if there is to be a special enrollment period CM SS would not likely communicate that until after Thanks giving as we get closer to the end of December 7th. George Sutton Got you just one other thing for John, if I could. We saw, you had reduced the constraint recently and you saw your tail revenues come in much more limited than in the past, is this. Do we feel really good about the constraint change we made? Is are we going to see relatively small tail revenues ahead? John Stelben Thanks George. You know, I think we, you know, we continue to analyze our performance volatility and the LTB trends that we've seen over time and we remain confident the change that we made was the right change. Yeah, we, you know, when we analyzed it, we did have a range of various outcomes and we actually, you know, we chose the conservative route and booked more at the lower end. So there was opportunity to actually take the constraint down lower. You know, we considered the current environment, how we chose our constraint and we maintain the appropriate level of conservatism in our process. You know, when we look at our first tail, we, you know, we have over $200 million accumulated, accumulated positive tail over the, since the adoption of 606 and we've seen 26 out of the last 27 quarters since the adoption that we said positive tail adjustments. Again, we, we do feel very confident and we make sure that we're you know, staying compliant with our 6 to 6 guidance. George Sutton Beautiful. Thank you guys. Appreciate it. Francis Soistman Thank you. Operator Thank you. And again, as a reminder to ask a question today, that is star one, you may withdraw your question at any time by pressing Star two. Again, that's star one. We'll pause another moment to allow any further questions to queue and there appear to be no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call to Francis for any closing remarks. Francis Soistman Thank you, operator. Well, I imagine many on the call this morning had a very late night. So thank you for joining. I really appreciate that as we close out this third quarter, I'd like to reiterate our commitment to delivering long term value and navigating this dynamic environment with resilience and focus e health transformation journey and business performance progress has been nothing short of remarkable and I remain optimistic about our ability to sustain this momentum through the end of this year. And throughout 2025 none of this would be possible without strong management team and our employees who have contributed to achieving a healthy and vibrant workplace. We're laser focused on achieving a successful a further enhancing the capital structure and unlocking shareholder value. The stage is set for continued success in 2025 to core strength and our exciting diversification initiatives. So we appreciate the continued support of our shareholders partners, our employees as we drive forward on our strategic priorities and we're confident in our path and remain committed to executing on our goals for sustained profitable growth. So, thank you. Once again, we look forward to updating on our progress in the quarters ahead.
