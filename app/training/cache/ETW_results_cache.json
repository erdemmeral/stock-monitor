[{"text": "Mandalay Intercepts 578 g/t Gold and 20% Antimony over 0.47 Metres at True Blue, a Potential Costerfield Mine Extension Mandalay Resources Corporation Tue, Jan 28, 2025, 3:00 PM 15 min read In This Article: MNDJF -0.58% Mandalay Resources Corporation TORONTO, Jan. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mandalay Resources Corporation (\"Mandalay\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: MND, OTCQB: MNDJF) is pleased to announce high-grade drill results at its True Blue prospect adjacent to the operating Costerfield gold-antimony mine in Victoria, Australia. Highlights of True Blue: High grades intercepted in upward extension of 2024\u2019s maiden Inferred Mineral Resource: 578.0 g/t gold and 20.5% antimony over 0.47 m (ETW 0.33 m) in TB031 16.8 g/t gold and 2.4 % antimony over 3.98 m (ETW 2.56 m) in TB027 Including 172.0 g/t gold and 19.2% antimony over 0.37 m 161.0 g/t gold over 0.19 m (ETW 0.15 m) in TB029 Drill testing and soil geochemistry indicate an extensive system with the potential to replicate Costerfield's Central Corridor which has sustained mining the past 15 years; Structural continuity interpreted on 600 m of strike, leaving 3.4 km of the system yet to be tested; and Follow-up drilling at True Blue has commenced with now two rigs mobilizing to further define mineralization and increase deposit confidence. Frazer Bourchier, President and CEO, commented: \u201cMandalay has been producing gold and antimony at Costerfield since we acquired the project 15 years ago. We are excited to see True Blue emerging as a potential new frontier for Costerfield, marking an exciting new chapter for Mandalay. This development reinforces our standing position as a growing gold producer and as the leading Western source of the strategic mineral antimony. Exploration continues to be a key strategic pillar for growth, with a minimum of $9 million allocated for the first half of 2025.\u201d Chris Davis, VP of Exploration and Operational Geology, commented: \"Exploration at True Blue has revealed geological similarities to the mined Central Corridor. These parallels in host lithology, structural setting, and fluid transport systems underscore the exceptional potential of True Blue. \"These results represent a significant breakthrough, intercepting high-grade mineralization with visible gold and stibnite (antimony mineral) veins. Mineralization extends 130 metres along strike with strong potential for expansion. The surface expression of the system lies 300 metres above these high-grade intercepts, highlighting its significant vertical extent. Encouragingly, drilling also confirmed down-dip mineralization at 590 metres depth with further potential. Step-out drilling of 600 metres to the south uncovered a wide anomalous mineralized zone of approximately 250 metres, with assays up to 3.8 g/t gold, highlighting the system's continuity and scale. Story Continues \"Mandalay is committed to unlocking the full potential of True Blue through an extensive extensional drilling program. Two rigs will commence follow-up drilling in the coming weeks, with results expected in the months ahead. Additional drill metres and drill rig intensity will be determined by staged assessments, as we work toward building a robust Mineral Resource to potentially extend Costerfield's mine life.\u201d Drill Program Details The True Blue prospect sits approximately 2 km to the west of the Youle and Shepherd deposits currently being mined by Mandalay. Mining of gold and antimony in the area began in 1861 and since Mandalay took ownership in December 2009, 577,000 ounces of gold and 65,000 tonnes of antimony have been mined at an overall grade of 9.1 g/t gold and 3.3 % antimony. This has been extracted from three major development areas along a 6 km mineralized \u201cCentral Corridor\u201d, from the Augusta mine in the south to the Youle mine in the north. True Blue has the potential to be another corridor of production with surface workings and soil geochemistry anomalism indicating a system spanning 4 kilometres in strike length (Figure 1). Map of Costerfield exploration tenements and mining licence Figure 1. Map of Costerfield exploration tenements and mining licence depicting the location of the main production areas within the central corridor and the True Blue prospect. Following the successful commencement of mining at Youle several years ago, Mandalay has completed a comprehensive assessment of the Costerfield mineral field. From this assessment, a number of targets were identified and drilled. With significant results coming from the initially prioritized Browns and Robinson deposits, the initial potential of True Blue was not realised until late 2022 when targeted drilling intercepted antimony mineralization. The next phase of drilling was undertaken through 2023-2024, confirming lower-grade southern structural continuity and an exceedingly high grade up-dip extension that displays not only continuity of high antimony endowment but also the introduction of coarse gold, occurring both within stibnite (antimony ore) and quartz. Highlights of this drilling include 16.8 g/t gold and 2.4 % antimony over 3.98 m (ETW 2.56 m) in TB027 and 578.0 g/t gold and 20.5% antimony over 0.47 m (ETW 0.33 m) in TB031 located 130m further north (Figure 2). Longitudinal section of the most continuous veinset interpreted from the True Blue drilling data. Figure 2. Longitudinal section of the most continuous veinset interpreted from the True Blue drilling data. Note that there is additional drilling of this system up dip, however this is in a parallel but separate veining network. The immediately up-dip extension of the vein set in this long section is untested. Drillholes are annotated with composites over 2.0 g/t AuEq when diluted to 1.8 m. The geometry of True Blue is similar to that of the Youle deposit, consisting of subvertical to west-dipping veins hosted by the western limb of an anticline (figure 3). Like Youle and Shepherd, structural continuity of the True Blue mineralized veins is remarkably consistent over the drill-tested area. This consistency is attributed to being hosted in the same lithology and the central corridor. Interacting fault structures, chiefly the west-dipping Bearded and Komodo Faults, also play an integral part in the formation of the typical Costerfield style mineralization identified at True Blue. Encouragingly the Bearded Fault has been found to be mineralized, with 161.0 g/t gold over 0.19 m (ETW 0.15 m) recovered in TB029. These west-dipping faults are interpreted to be contemporaneous with and genetically similar to the highly mineralized host fault of the Youle deposit. This correlation allows comparison of True Blue with observations already made during mining at Youle and enables the acceleration of predictive modelling for further exploration. Following predictions based on a Youle-like model applied to the current understanding of True Blue, a deeper hole (TB026) was drilled with the aim of testing the Komodo Fault down-dip of its modelled interaction with vertical mineralization. Sub-vertical stibnite veins were intercepted at a depth of 590m below surface with an intercept grading 1.6 g/t gold and 1.7 g/t gold over 1.16 m (ETW 0.82 m), an exciting result despite the Komodo Fault being intercepted further down hole than expected resulting in the targeted geological setting not being fully tested. Cross section at 7300N of the True Blue mineralization as interpreted by drilling to date. Figure 3. Cross section at 7300N of the True Blue mineralization as interpreted by drilling to date. Intercepts from TB027 and TB031 do align with the interpreted veining and appear to be east and west of the veining, however this is due to off section effects. The veining at True Blue is generally subvertical in nature, often consisting of a cluster of individual narrow veins concentrated within a 0.5 m-thick zone controlled by subtle anticline-parallel foliation, however in some areas parallel mineralized veinlets persist up to 5 m from the main veining (Figure 4). Mineralization within these intercepts range from quartz dominant to stibnite dominant, with gold occurring as visible grains often in clusters up to 0.4 cm diameter within both quartz and stibnite (Figure 5 inset). Gold has also been observed in the form of \u201cveinlets\u201d within stibnite of up to 3 cm in length and 0.2 mm in width, which is unusual for Costerfield (Figure 6 inset). Hydrothermal white-mica and carbonate alteration is widespread within the wall rock and provides further vectoring potential as exploration continues. Carbonate spotting in particular is observed at greater intensity than the bulk of other Costerfield deposits. Fine-grained pyrite and euhedral arsenopyrite is present proximal to the mineralized veins. Photograph of True Blue intercept from TB027 (16.8 g/t gold & 2.4 antimony over 3.98 m (ETW 2.43 m).

Applying Costerfield\u2019s Central Corridor as an analogous model (supported by the numerous structural and mineralogical similarities observed) to the geochemical footprint of the True Blue prospect, Mandalay expects that the 4 kilometre strike of the line has the potential to host several economic deposits in addition to the zone that is being currently drill tested. In 2024, Mandalay drilled 2 step-out holes south of the known True Blue vein system. One intercepted a very wide mineralized zone, containing arrays of mineralized veins over a down hole length of approximately 250 m, with individual assays reaching up to 3.8 g/t gold and 2.3% antimony. Although these results are lower grade and disseminated throughout the drill hole, such intercepts are unprecedented at Costerfield and the presence of this highly anomalous mineralization is strong evidence for the system being able to generate economic mineralization along the entire strike length of the anomaly corridor.

Illustrated on the map is the latest geological interpretation, Geochemical analysis of soils and location of recent drilling. Although still at an early stage of testing, True Blue has significant potential and exploration of the corridor is made easier by the observed structural and mineralogical similarity to Costerfield\u2019s highly profitable central corridor. Since 2022 exploration success at Costerfield has been achieved by effectively testing geological models based on knowledge gained through the past two decades of mining. During 2025 the extensional and step out drilling programmes will continue as we seek to confirm mineral resources along the corridor. Drilling and Assaying All diamond drill core was logged and sampled by Costerfield geologists or contracted geologists with significant industry experience who worked under Costerfield geologist\u2019s oversight. All samples were sent to On Site Laboratory Services (OSLS) in Bendigo, Victoria, Australia, for sample preparation and analysis by fire assay for gold, and Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) for antimony. Site geological and metallurgical personnel have implemented a QA/QC procedure that includes systematic submission of standard reference materials and blanks within batches of drill and face samples submitted for assay. Costerfield specific reference materials produced from Costerfield ore have been prepared and certified by Geostats Pty Ltd., a specialist laboratory quality control consultancy.

Regional KSP Property Featuring Consistent Mineralization of 0.71 gpt gold over 381.5 metres Skeena Resources Limited Thu, Jan 16, 2025, 3:08 PM 20 min read In This Article: SKE +0.92% Skeena Resources Limited (TSX:SKE)(NYSE:SKE) (\"Skeena Gold & Silver\", \"Skeena\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce drill results from the 2024 exploratory drilling program at the KSP Property in the Golden Triangle of British Columbia. The KSP Property is situated 24 kilometers southwest of Eskay Creek and 5 kilometers southeast of the Snip Project, positioned within a highly prospective region of the Company's expansive 178,901-hectare land package in the Golden Triangle. During the 2024 season, 22 drillholes totaling 9,182 metres were completed across various targets on the project, highlighted by the drill discovery of wide intervals of previously undocumented Au-Cu porphyry mineralization. Analytical results and reference images can be found at the end of this news release. Paul Geddes, Skeena's Senior Vice President of Exploration & Resource Development, commented \"We are very encouraged that our first drill program at KSP has yielded the discovery of a new Gold-Copper Porphyry system on the property. The headline intercept of 0.71 grams per tonne gold over 380 metres, is among many strong results and demonstrates a substantial volume of mineralized material in a potentially very large, essentially unexplored mineralized system.\" 2024 KSP Drilling Highlights 1,2 0.62 gpt Au, 2.84 gpt Ag, 0.14 % Cu over 121.50 metres ETW (CP-24-001) 4.56 gpt Au, 1.34 gpt Ag, 0.06 % Cu over 11.00 metres ETW, including 19.30 gpt Au, 2.30 gpt Ag, 0.08 % Cu over 2.50 metres ETW (CP-24-001) 0.71 gpt Au, 0.69 gpt Ag, 0.03 % Cu over 381.47 metres ETW, including 0.50 gpt Au, 0.78 gpt Ag, 0.03 % Cu over 117.47 metres ETW and 1.07 gpt Au, 0.68 gpt Ag, 0.03 % Cu over 139.00 metres ETW (CP-24-004) 6.44 gpt Au, 3.40 gpt Ag, 0.23 % Cu over 7.61 metres ETW (CP-24-008) 1.82 gpt Au, 2.85 gpt Ag, 0.11 % Cu over 25.00 metres ETW including: 9.79 gpt Au, 7.50 gpt Ag, 0.21 % Cu over 2.50 metres ETW (CP-24-008) 0.49 gpt Au, 2.15 gpt Ag, 0.02 % Cu over 75.15 metres ETW (CP-24-011) 0.72 gpt Au, 1.86 gpt Ag, 0.05 % Cu over 41.69 metres ETW (KP-24-004) Notes: Abbreviations include: gpt: grams per tonne; Au: gold; Ag: silver; Cu: copper; m: metre ETW: True widths cannot be estimated with any certainty at this time, as such, core lengths have been reported. New Gold-Copper Porphyry Mineralization Discovered Situated on the northwestern portion of the KSP Project and approximately 5 kilometers southeast of the Company's Snip Gold Project, the Camp Porphyry area is host to a large, previously unexplored porphyry body. Drilling by the Company in 2024 has intersected broad intervals of previously unrecognized Au-Cu porphyry mineralization featured by 381.47 metres averaging 0.71 gpt Au, 0.69 gpt Ag, 0.03 % Cu beginning at 50 metres below surface. This initial phase of widely spaced exploratory drilling has traced the new mineralization along a strike length of approximately 1,000 meters, with potential for further expansion through additional drilling. Reference images are available at the end of this release. Story Continues Although recognized by previous operators, this large porphyry body was never the focus of historical exploration programs as other areas of the KSP Project took priority at the time. During the 2024 surface mapping program however, a new, widespread gold and copper geochemical anomaly was delineated over this intrusion at surface. This new anomaly, corroborated by a resistivity target defined from the 2024 deep penetrating airborne ZTEM resistivity survey, prompted the Company to test this target with eleven widely spaced exploration drill holes totaling 4,235 metres. Numerous Au-Cu intervals were intersected in discovery drill hole CP-24-004 on the western flank of the intrusion which is coincident with the margin of a very large and discrete ZTEM resistivity anomaly. The extensive distribution of Au-Cu mineralization begins at 50 metres below surface over a drilled length of 381.47 metres averaging 0.71 gpt Au, 0.69 gpt Ag, 0.03 % Cu with subintervals grading 0.50 gpt Au, 0.78 gpt Ag, 0.03 % Cu over 117.47 metres and 1.07 gpt Au, 0.68 gpt Ag, 0.03 % Cu over 139.00 metres . These intersections display classical porphyry system alteration assemblages and elevated Au-Cu tenor is associated with potassic (biotite) alteration signatures. The Camp Porphyry is a polyphase intrusion in that at least two significant intrusive events have occurred during emplacement. Most importantly, the first intrusive pulse, which also interacted with the surrounding sediment package and deposited Au-Cu mineralization, has been partially digested by a second unmineralized pulse within the core of body. As such, mineralization at the Camp Porphyry is associated with the outermost first intrusive pulse particularly where it has interacted with the porous sediments (wackes), as opposed to the less porous siltstone horizons. Additional mineralization situated 140 metres along strike to the east was intersected by 2024 drill hole CP-24-011 in a broad interval averaging 0.49 gpt Au, 2.15 gpt Ag, 0.02 % Cu over 75.15 metres beginning at 273.35 metres downhole. The upper portion of this drill hole was dominated by the secondary unmineralized intrusive. discussed previously. Located 675 metres further to the east, drill holes CP-24-001 and CP-24-002 intersected 0.62 gpt Au, 2.84 gpt Ag, 0.14 % Cu over 121.50 metres and 0.52 gpt Au, 2.00 gpt Ag, 0.08 % Cu over 62.00 metres respectively with the same styles and controls of mineralization. Camp Porphyry ZTEM Resistivity Anomaly The 2024 drilling program was supplemented by an airborne ZTEM survey that covered the northern portion of the KSP Project. An airborne electromagnetic platform, the ZTEM system is deep penetrating and used to discriminate resistivity contrasts in the subsurface. The Camp Porphyry and associated mineralization possess a close spatial association and geometric similarity with a large ZTEM anomaly that occurs underneath the porphyry with a strike length in excess of ~6,000 metres. Khyber Pass Depth limited, small scale drill programs investigating porphyry style Au-Cu mineralization in the Khyber Pass area have been performed by previous operators since 1985. Historical 2017 drill hole KBDDH17-097 ended in Au-Cu mineralization but averaged 0.63 gpt Au, 2.08 gpt Ag, 0.08 % Cu over 34.00 metres . In 2024, a re-evaluation of the historic core from the Khyber Pass area prompted a program of exploratory drilling to follow up on the historic drilling that may not have completely tested this prospective area. Highlighted by 2024 drill hole KP-24-004, which averaged 0.72 gpt Au, 1.86 gpt Ag, 0.05 % Cu over 41.69 metres, drilling indicates that the Khyber Pass area may represent a higher-level expression of a larger porphyry system as evidenced by the volumetrically lower percentage of intrusive monzodiorites. The Khyber Pass mineralization is situated ~600 metres vertically above the Camp Porphyry and may represent a higher-level expression of the system. Tami Area Previous operators outlined low grade Cu-Au porphyry mineralization in the Tami area of the KSP Project via drilling in 2017. Occurring at surface with a flat dipping tabular geometry, Tami mineralization has been drill defined over an area measuring ~600 metres by ~150 metres. In 2024, the Company drilled three drill holes totaling 1,226 metres in this and the surrounding area to investigate untested geophysical targets with coincident geochemical anomalies. No significant results were returned from this drilling.

Results include 9.5 g/t gold-equivalent over 2 metres estimated true width VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Jan. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Prime Mining Corp. (\u201cPrime\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d)\u00a0(TSX: PRYM) (OTCQX: PRMNF) ( Frankfurt: 04V3) is reporting expansion drilling results and new \u201cTahonitas Footwall\u201d discovery from the Company\u2019s Los Reyes Project (the \u201cProject\u201d), located in Sinaloa State, Mexico. These results are from 2024 drilling at the Z-T Trend and are not included in the Company\u2019s October 15, 2024, Mineral Resource Estimate (\u201cMRE\u201d). Expansion Drilling Highlights at Z-T The Company is reporting 25 core holes at the Z-T Trend, 14 of which are from Tahonitas, located in the south-east end of the Z-T Trend, with the following highlights: 5.67 grams per tonne (\u201cg/t\u201d) gold-equivalent (\u201cAuEq\u201d) (2.23 g/t Au and 266.1 g/t Ag) over 4.2 metres (\u201cm\u201d) estimated true wide (\u201cetw\u201d) in hole 24TA-149, including: 9.49 g/t AuEq (3.94 g/t Au and 428.7 g/t Ag) over 2.1 m etw; 1.62 g/t AuEq (1.36 g/t Au and 19.9 g/t Ag) over 15.2 m etw in hole 24TA-144, including: 4.94 g/t AuEq (4.22 g/t Au and 55.3 g/t Ag) over 3.7 m etw; 4.93 g/t AuEq (2.55 g/t Au and 184.0 g/t Ag) over 3.3 m etw in hole 24TA-153, including: 14.09 g/t AuEq (7.09 g/t Au and 541.0 g/t Ag) over 1.1 m etw; And also, 0.92 g/t AuEq (0.72 g/t Au and 15.2 g/t Ag) over 19.2 m etw in hole 24TA-153. Prime Mining Corp. Chief Executive Officer Scott Hicks commented, \u201cThe quality of the high-grade results from the new Tahonitas Footwall Zone in Z-T demonstrates the continued resource expansion potential beyond what has been included in the updated underground and open pit Mineral Resource Estimate. The southern-most holes are over 650 metres south of the MRE pit crest and approximately 250 metres along strike from the southern-most stope. All intercepts in these highlight drill holes are less than 200 metres from surface and located south along strike and outside the resource pit crest, with potential for either open pit or underground extraction.\u201d Scott Smith, Executive Vice President of Exploration, added, \u201c24TA-144, -153, -155, and -156 delineate a newly discovered high-grade ore shoot at the southernmost end of Tahonitas on the Z-T Trend. The shoot, currently defined over 260 metres by 140 metres, remains open along strike in both directions and at depth and will be a key focus for follow-up drilling. It is great to see that our grassroots, boots on the ground field programs, such as mapping and soil sampling, have led to this exciting new discovery.\u201d Figure 1: Expansion drilling update Figure 1 - Los Reyes Drill Program Progress_Jan 2025 Z-T Trend Drill Hole Highlights \u2013 Tahonitas and Zapote 1 Story Continues Hole ID From (m) To (m) Interval (m) ETW (m) 2 Au (g/t) Ag (g/t) AuEq 3 (g/t) Au Cut- off 4 (g/t) 24TA-144 148.6 163.8 15.2 15.2 1.36 19.9 1.62 0.2 including 148.6 149.4 0.8 0.8 1.17 28.5 1.54 1.0 & including 155.0 158.6 3.7 3.7 4.22 55.3 4.94 1.0 24TA-149 212.3 216.5 4.2 4.2 2.23 266.1 5.67 0.2 including 212.3 214.4 2.1 2.1 3.94 428.7 9.49 1.0 24TA-153 170.5 174.5 4.1 3.3 2.55 184.0 4.93 0.2 including 170.5 171.8 1.4 1.1 7.09 541.0 14.09 1.0 24TA-153 178.5 201.9 23.5 19.2 0.72 15.2 0.92 0.2 including 183.0 185.9 2.9 2.4 2.23 45.9 2.82 1.0 24TA-156 211.8 227.7 15.9 11.3 0.72 30.4 1.11 0.2 including 215.1 217.6 2.5 1.8 1.97 77.9 2.98 1.0 including 221.1 223.0 1.9 1.4 1.06 65.5 1.91 1.0 24TA-156 231.0 237.0 6.0 4.2 1.16 14.1 1.34 0.2 including 235.2 235.9 0.8 0.6 4.69 23.3 4.99 1.0 24ZAP-130 277.7 288.9 11.2 10.8 1.07 19.8 1.33 0.2 including 284.6 288.9 4.4 4.2 1.99 31.7 2.40 1.0 24ZAP-131 275.5 286.2 10.7 10.7 1.06 16.3 1.27 0.2 including 276.2 277.3 1.1 1.1 3.44 24.8 3.76 0.2 including 284.2 285.2 1.0 1.0 4.60 53.0 5.29 0.2 24ZAP-134 234.0 243.7 9.7 9.4 1.20 5.6 1.27 0.2 including 239.3 240.6 1.3 1.3 6.27 12.9 6.44 1.0 24ZAP-136 226.5 228.2 1.7 1.7 4.32 23.2 4.62 0.2 24ZAP-137 311.6 320.0 8.5 8.5 1.21 17.1 1.43 0.2 including 314.0 315.3 1.3 1.3 5.81 44.3 6.38 1.0 24ZAP-138 224.5 228.4 3.9 3.4 1.35 14.7 1.54 0.2 including 224.5 225.8 1.3 1.1 3.28 35.0 3.73 1.0 24ZAP-138 231.0 238.3 7.3 6.3 0.82 7.4 0.92 0.2 including 232.7 234.0 1.3 1.2 2.77 10.8 2.91 1.0 Notes: A complete table of assay results from all deposits and all secondary zones intersected utilizing a 0.20 g/t Au cut-off is on the Company's website. Estimated True Widths (ETW) are estimated based on drill hole geology or comparisons with other on-section drill holes. Au Equivalent (AuEq) grade is calculated as Au g/t + (Ag g/t x ($25.24/$1950)) where $25.24 and $1950 are the price of one ounce of Ag and Au respectively (in US dollars). Composite assay grades presented in summary tables are calculated using a Au grade minimum average of 0.20 g/t or 1.0 g/t as indicated in \u201cAu Cut-off\u201d column of Summary Tables. Maximum internal waste included in any reported composite interval is 3.00 m. The 1.00 g/t Au cut-off is used to define higher-grade \u201ccores\u201d within the lower-grade halo. INTERPRETATION Tahonitas: New Footwall Structure Drilling at the southeast end of Tahonitas has resulted in the discovery of a newly identified mineralized quartz vein in the footwall of the main Z-T structure. This vein, defined by 24TA-144, -153, -154, -155, and -156, is host to a high-grade ore shoot which currently measures 260x140m and remains open at depth and along strike both to the southeast and to the northwest toward the 2024 MRE pit crest. Overall, the drill results released today reflect wide mineralized intervals and good grades which may be amenable to either open pit or underground mining methods. The target was initially identified by Prime's detailed surface mapping program in conjunction with soil geochemistry and shortwave infrared (SWIR) mineral analyses. This work delineated an overlapping zone of subtle gold-in-soil anomalism, northwest-striking quartz veinlets, and illite alteration, suggesting potential for Au-Ag mineralization at depth. This area will continue to be a focus for follow-up in 2025, with drilling planned to test extensions to this newly identified ore shoot in several directions. Priority targets include the nearly 500m gap between 24TA-144 and the 2024 MRE pit crest, and potential extensions along strike to the south of 24TA-155 and 24TA-156, which currently place the southernmost extent of the shoot at roughly 650m along strike from the 2024 MRE pit crest. Zapote: Expanding Underground Opportunities The Company is also releasing 11 holes from Zapote in the Z-T Trend. Drill holes completed in the Zapote target area continued to demonstrate grades greater than 1 g/t AuEq over significant thicknesses outside of the 2024 MRE\u2019s stopes and pits at depth. These drillholes, along with those previously released for Zapote in 2024, continue to confirm the potential for expanded underground opportunities previously demonstrated in the Company's October 15, 2024 MRE. Z-T Trend The ongoing discovery of mineralization hosted along strike and at depth continues to suggest the following: The Z-T structure continues to be mineralized for more than 600m along strike from the current south-east pit crest. The potential exists to discover more high-grade plunging shoots with continued drilling below the current resource pit bottom and within the new south-east strike extension. These high-grade shoots have the potential to support underground resource estimation. Several high-grade plunging shoots identified to-date remain open at depth and along strike in multiple areas along the Trend.

This evaluation will also include prioritization of targets based on probability of resource development and generative area discovery potential. Six drill rigs are currently active on site at Los Reyes, with exploration focused on: Extending the high-grade Z-T Area shoots that remain open at depth, as well as along strike, both north and south. Expanding the known high-grade mineralization at Guadalupe East . Increasing the Central Area resource through additions at Noche Buena and its connection to San Miguel East. Generative target drilling of high-grade intercepts at Las Primas, Mariposa, Fresnillo and others to further develop the resource potential at Los Reyes.

Refer to the Additional Notes section for the gold equivalent grade (\u201cAuEq\u201d) calculation method. Drilling is ongoing and suggests that the three known main deposit areas (Guadalupe, Central and Z-T) are larger than previously reported. Potential also exists for new discoveries where mineralized trends have been identified outside of the currently defined resource areas. Historic operating results indicate that an estimated 1 million ounces of gold and 60 million ounces of silver were recovered from five separate operations at Los Reyes between 1770 and 1990. Prior to Prime\u2019s acquisition, recent operators of Los Reyes had spent approximately US$20 million on exploration, engineering, and prefeasibility studies. QA/QC Protocols and Sampling Procedures Drill core at the Los Reyes project is drilled in predominately HQ size (63.5 millimetres \u201cmm\u201d), reducing to NQ (47.6 mm) when required. Drill core samples are generally 1.50 m long along the core axis with allowance for shorter or longer intervals if required to suit geological constraints. After logging intervals are identified to be sampled, the core is cut and one half is submitted for assay. RC drilling returns rock chips and fines from a 133.35 mm diameter tricone bit. The returns are homogenized and split into 2 halves, with one half submitted for analysis and the other half stored. Sample QA/QC measures include unmarked certified reference materials, blanks, and field duplicates as well as preparation duplicates are inserted into the sample sequence and make up approximately 8% of the samples submitted to the laboratory for each drill hole. Samples are picked up from the Project by the laboratory personnel and transported to their facilities in Durango or Hermosillo Mexico, for sample preparation. Sample analysis is carried out by Bureau Veritas and ALS Labs, with fire assay, including over limits fire assay re-analysis, completed at their respective Hermosillo, Mexico laboratories and multi-element analysis completed in North Vancouver, Canada. Drill core sample preparation includes fine crushing of the sample to at least 70% passing less than 2 mm, sample splitting using a riffle splitter, and pulverizing a 250-gram split to at least 85% passing 75 microns. Gold in diamond drill core is analyzed by fire assay and atomic absorption spectroscopy of a 30 g sample (code FA430 or Au-AA23). Multi-element chemistry is analyzed by 4-Acid digestion of a 0.25-gram sample split (code MA300 or ME-ICP61) with detection by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer for a full suite of elements. Gold assay techniques FA430 and Au-AA23 have an upper detection limit of 10 ppm. Any sample that produces an over-limit gold value via the initial assay technique is sent for gravimetric finish via method FA-530 or Au-GRA21. Silver analyses by MA300 and ME-ICP61 have an upper limit of 200 ppm and 100 ppm, respectively. Samples with over-limit silver values are re-analyzed by fire assay with gravimetric finish FA530 or Au-GRA21. Both Bureau Veritas and ALS Labs are ISO/IEC accredited assay laboratories. Additional Notes Prime\u2019s MRE as of October 15, 2024 is classified in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (\u201c CIM \u201d) \u201cCIM Definition Standards - For Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves\u201d adopted by the CIM Council (as amended, the \u201c CIM Definition Standards \u201d) and in accordance with the requirements of NI 43-101. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. Metres is represented by \u201cm\u201d; \u201cetw\u201d is Estimated\u00a0True Width and is based on drill hole geometry or comparisons with other on-section drill holes; \u201cAu\u201d refers to gold, and \u201cAg\u201d refers to silver; \u201cg/t\u201d is grams per metric tonne; some figures may not sum due to rounding; Composite assay grades presented in summary tables are calculated using a Au grade minimum average of 0.20 g/t or 1.0 g/t as indicated in \u201cAu Cut-off\u201d column of Summary Tables. Maximum internal waste included in any reported composite interval is 3.00 m. The 1.00 g/t Au cut-off is used to define higher-grade \u201ccores\u201d within the lower-grade halo. Gold equivalent grades are calculated based on an assumed gold price of US$1,950 per ounce and silver price of $25.24 per ounce, based on the formula AuEq grade (g/t) = Au grade + (Ag grade x $25.24 / $1,950).

In particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the terms \u201cmineral reserve\u201d, \u201cproven mineral reserve\u201d, \u201cprobable mineral reserve\u201d, \u201cinferred mineral resources,\u201d \u201cindicated mineral resources,\u201d \u201cmeasured mineral resources\u201d and \u201cmineral resources\u201d used or referenced in this presentation are Canadian mineral disclosure terms as defined in accordance with NI 43-101 under the guidelines set out in the CIM Standards. The CIM Standards differ from the mineral property disclosure requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201c SEC \u201d) in Regulation S-K Subpart 1300 (the \u201c SEC Modernization Rules \u201d) under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201c Securities Act \u201d).

Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts which address events, results, outcomes, or developments that the Company expects to occur. Forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs, estimates and opinions of the Company\u2019s management on the date the statements are made, and they involve several risks and uncertainties. Certain material assumptions regarding such forward-looking statements were made, including without limitation, assumptions regarding the price of gold, silver and copper; the accuracy of mineral resource estimations; that there will be no material adverse change affecting the Company or its properties; that all required approvals will be obtained, including concession renewals and permitting; that political and legal developments will be consistent with current expectations; that currency and exchange rates will be consistent with current levels; and that there will be no significant disruptions affecting the Company or its properties. Consequently, there can be no assurances that such statements will prove to be accurate and actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.

Valentine Remains on Track for Q2, 2025 Gold Production Tailings Management Facility is complete and receiving water; SAG and Ball Mill continue to advance towards pre-commissioning; Structural, mechanical and piping activities continue to advance in the Grinding, ADR, Reagents, and Gold Room areas; CIL leaching tanks construction is complete and mechanical/electrical work has commenced; Overland and coarse ore stockpile conveyor is progressing and reclaim tunnel is preparing for apron feeders; Primary crusher installation is complete and preparing for commissioning; Pre-commissioning is well underway; and Initial project capital costs, exclusive of sunk costs, remains at approximately C$744 million. Story Continues Darren Hall, President and Chief Executive Officer of Calibre, stated : \u201cCalibre achieved total gold production of 242,487 ounces in 2024. After addressing challenges in the third quarter, we delivered an exceptional fourth quarter, producing a record 76,269 ounces. Looking ahead, 2025 is shaping up to be a transformational year for Calibre with first gold production from Valentine on schedule for Q2. With Valentine fully operational, Calibre transitions into a robust, multi-asset, diversified mid-tier gold producer. Valentine is poised to become a long-life, cornerstone asset in Canada, initially delivering approximately 200,000 ounces of gold annually with significant exploration upside. We have made substantial progress on technical studies to increase Valentine\u2019s throughput in a phase two expansion. While the original design envisioned an increase in throughput from the currently planned 2.5 million tonnes per year to 4 million tonnes per year starting in 2029, we are now actively advancing plans to accelerate the timeline for scaling up production to as much as 5.4 million tonnes per year. In 2025, we will focus on detailed engineering and schedule with the intent of committing to long lead time items before year end. Considering these developments, Valentine has the potential to exceed the production levels outlined in the 2022 feasibility study, especially given the promising results emerging from our ongoing exploration efforts. This positions Calibre for substantial growth and value creation in the coming months and years. As previously announced, our exploration investment at Valentine has delivered very exciting results. November\u2019s discovery of broad widths of gold mineralization outside mineral resources at the Frank Zone, approximately 1 km south of the Valentine Gold Mine demonstrates the upside potential. Results included 2.43 g/t gold over 172.8 metres including 3.84 g/t gold over 90.9 metres, 2.12 g/t gold over 95.4 metres and 2.26 g/t gold over 78.3 metres from the initial discovery . Our 2024 drilling program wrapped up in mid December, and we anticipate providing additional results surrounding the Frank Zone discovery as assays become available. Exploration is ramping up and as construction activity progresses to completion, we expect to add drills to increase the Valentine exploration activity throughout the year. In 2025, we expect to execute the largest annual exploration drill program in the property\u2019s history. The geologic setting at Valentine is similar to the prolific Val d\u2019Or and Timmins camps in the Abitibi gold belt. This, in combination with the significant prospectivity of the 32-kilometre Valentine Lake Shear Zone (\u201cVLSZ\u201d), I am confident that we will continue to deliver strong exploration results, unlocking the potential of this highly prospective region. Additionally, we are very encouraged by the continued exploration success across our assets in Nicaragua. During 2024, we announced numerous high-grade results from the Talavera Gold Zone and the VTEM Gold Corridor within the Limon Mine Complex demonstrating the exceptional potential for rapid resource growth. During 2025, I anticipate additional success as we expand our exploration efforts and again advance a multi-rig 100,000 metre drill program.\u201d Significant Exploration Beyond Known Resources at the Valentine Gold Mine, Newfoundland & Labrador, Canada On July 15, 2024, Calibre announced an expanded 100,000 metre discovery and resource expansion program on high-priority targets across the exceptionally prospective 32-kilometre VLSZ. To date, diamond drilling has predominately occurred along 8 kilometres of the VLSZ which has outlined 64.6 Mt grading 1.90 g/t gold containing 3.95 Moz of Measured and Indicated Resources and 20.7 Mt grading 1.65 g/t gold containing 1.10 Moz of Inferred Resources ( see news release dated Nov 13, 2023 ). On November 25, 2024, Calibre announced the discovery of new broad zones of gold mineralization. The drill results included numerous intercepts with visible gold and both high grade intersections and broad zones of continuous mineralization in several holes, all of which are located outside of known mineral resources. Highlights from the Frank Zone drill program, southwest of the Leprechaun pit, include : 2.43 g/t Au over 172.8 metres Estimated True Width (\u201cETW\u201d) including 3.84 g/t Au over 90.9 metres ETW; 2.12 g/t Au over 95.4 metres ETW; 2.26 g/t Au over 78.3 metres ETW; 10.21 g/t Au over 2.9 metres ETW; 5.50 g/t Au over 6.0 metres ETW; 1.73 g/t Au over 11.0 metres ETW; 13.39 g/t Au over 0.9 metres; and 8.34 g/t Au over 1.0 metres ETW; and 11.15 g/t Au over 0.9 metres ETW. 2025 Guidance The 2025 guidance currently covers gold production, Total Cash Cost (\u201cTCC\u201d), All-In Sustaining Cost (\u201cAISC\u201d), and growth capital for operations in Nicaragua and Nevada. Additionally, the consolidated exploration guidance includes drilling activities in Newfoundland & Labrador, Canada. Guidance for Valentine, including production, TCC, AISC, growth capital, and full-year consolidated details, will be provided after the first gold is produced from Valentine, which is expected in Q2 2025.

Notes (1) NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES The Company believes that investors use certain non-IFRS measures as indicators to assess gold mining companies, specifically TCC per Ounce of Gold and AISC per Ounce of Gold. In the gold mining industry, these are common performance measures but do not have any standardized meaning. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company\u2019s performance and ability to generate cash flow. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. TCC per Ounce of Gold : TCC include mine site operating costs such as mining, processing, and local administrative costs (including stock-based compensation related to mine operations), royalties, production taxes, mine standby costs and current inventory write downs, if any.\u00a0 Production costs are exclusive of depreciation and depletion, reclamation, capital, and exploration costs.\u00a0 TCC per gold ounce are net of by-product silver sales and are divided by gold ounces sold to arrive at a per ounce figure. AISC per Ounce of Gold : A performance measure that reflects all of the expenditures that are required to produce an ounce of gold from current operations. While there is no standardized meaning of the measure across the industry, the Company\u2019s definition is derived from the AISC definition as set out by the World Gold Council in its guidance dated June 27, 2013, and November 16, 2018. The World Gold Council is a non-regulatory, non-profit organization established in 1987 whose members include global senior mining companies and the Company. The Company believes that this measure will be useful to external users in assessing operating performance and the ability to generate free cash flow from current operations. The Company defines AISC as the sum of TCC (per above), sustaining capital (capital required to maintain current operations at existing levels), capital lease repayments, corporate general and administrative expenses, exploration expenditures designed to increase resource confidence at producing mines, amortization of asset retirement costs and rehabilitation accretion related to current operations. AISC excludes capital expenditures for significant improvements at existing operations deemed to be expansionary in nature, exploration and evaluation related to resource growth, rehabilitation accretion and amortization not related to current operations, financing costs, debt repayments, and taxes. Total AISC are divided by gold ounces sold to arrive at a per ounce figure.

Bond Fund Right Now? Zacks Equity Research Mon, Dec 30, 2024, 3:00 PM 4 \u5206\u9418\u95b1\u8b80\u6642\u9593 \u5728\u9019\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\u4e2d: ETW -0.70% If you've been stuck searching for Muni - Bonds funds, you might want to consider passing on by Eaton Vance MA Municipals C (ECMMX) as a possibility. ECMMX bears a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 5 (Strong Sell), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance. Objective Zacks categorizes ECMMX as Muni - Bonds, which is a segment packed with options. Muni - Bonds funds invest in debt securities issued by states or local municipalities. These are generally used to finance construction of infrastructure, pay for schools, or other government functions. Some are backed by taxes (revenue bonds), while others are \" general obligation \" and may not be backed by a defined source. Investors usually appreciate the tax benefits that come with many municipal bonds, which are especially impressive for those in high tax brackets. History of Fund/Manager Eaton Vance is based in Boston, MA, and is the manager of ECMMX. Eaton Vance MA Municipals C debuted in July of 2006. Since then, ECMMX has accumulated assets of about $1.52 million, according to the most recently available information. The fund is currently managed by Craig Brandon who has been in charge of the fund since February of 2010. Performance Investors naturally seek funds with strong performance. This fund has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of -0.28%, and is in the bottom third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of -1.49%, which places it in the bottom third during this time-frame. It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower. When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Compared to the category average of 11.92%, the standard deviation of ECMMX over the past three years is 7.67%. Over the past 5 years, the standard deviation of the fund is 6.56% compared to the category average of 12.28%. This makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half-decade. ECMMX carries a beta of 0.8, meaning that the fund is less volatile than a broad market index of fixed income securities. With this in mind, it has a negative alpha of -1.58, which measures performance on a risk-adjusted basis. \u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80 Ratings Investors should also consider a bond's rating, which is a grade ( 'AAA' to 'D' ) given to a bond that indicates its credit quality. With this letter scale in mind, ECMMX has 69.7% in high quality bonds rated at least 'AA' or higher, while 23.9% are of medium quality, with ratings of 'A' to 'BBB'. The fund has an average quality of AA, and focuses on high quality securities. Expenses Costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing, and particularly as competition heats up in this market. And all things being equal, a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors. In terms of fees, ECMMX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 1.47% compared to the category average of 0.85%. From a cost perspective, ECMMX is actually more expensive than its peers. While the minimum initial investment for the product is $1,000, investors should also note that there is no minimum for each subsequent investment. Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included. Bottom Line Overall, Eaton Vance MA Municipals C ( ECMMX ) has a low Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively weak performance, better downside risk, and higher fees, Eaton Vance MA Municipals C ( ECMMX ) looks like a somewhat weak choice for investors right now.

read In This Article: MNDJF -0.58% TORONTO , Dec. 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Mandalay Resources Corporation (\"Mandalay\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: MND) (OTCQB: MNDJF) is pleased to provide an update on near mine exploration success at its Bj\u00f6rkdal operation in Sweden , highlighting the discovery of North Zone Below Marble \u2013 a new underground mineral domain 200 meters (\"m\") north of the current operations. This news release is the fourth in a series of updates on our 2024 exploration progress at Bj\u00f6rkdal. New Drilling Highlights: North Zone Below Marble Discovery: Identified 18 interpreted veins over a 400 m strike length and 250 m in height, located approximately 200 m from current development. A maiden Mineral Resource estimate expected in\u00a0Mandalay's year-end update (to be released February 2025 ), has the potential to add multiple years of mine life. Key intercepts include: 178.9 g/t gold over 1.15 m (Estimated True Width \"ETW\" 0.94 m ) and; 39.6 g/t gold over 3.90 m (ETW 2.76 m ) in MU24-010 and; 69.4 g/t gold over 0.80 m (ETW 0.69 m ) in MU24-024. Main Zone Infill Drilling: Continued success in Eastern Extension with intercepts: 115.8 g/t gold over 1.85 m (ETW 1.60 m ) in MU24-018 and; 43.0 g/t gold over 1.55 m (ETW 1.34 m ) in MU24-020. Aurora Zone Extension: Successful testing of a 200 m strike extension identified: 3.4 g/t gold over 7.40 m (ETW 3.70 m ) in MU24-004 and; 3.9 g/t gold over 2.70 m (ETW 1.70 m ) in MU24-001. Note: Further intercept details including significant intercepts within composite intervals can be found in the Appendix to this document. Chris Davis , VP of Exploration and Operational Geology, commented: \"Bj\u00f6rkdal's near-mine exploration primarily targets higher margin resources. The newly discovered North Zone Below Marble exhibits consistent, high-grade veining approximately 200 m north of the current underground mine. The veining architecture is similar to the Main Zone, known for its consistently higher-grade ore. This discovery remains open at depth and along strike. \"Additionally, infill drilling in the Eastern Extension of the Main Zone has continued to demonstrate consistent veining and gold endowment through the zone. The Main Zone remains unbound and further extension is expected as appropriate drill platforms become available as mining progresses into the area. \"Lastly, exploration in the larger Aurora Zone has successfully identified wide gold-bearing veins at depth and to the east, approximately 180 m along strike of current mining operations. These intercepts reinforce Aurora's potential for extended delivery of bulk tonnage.\" Story Continues 2024 Bj\u00f6rkdal Near Mine Focus Near mine exploration through 2024 has focused on three extension areas of the Bj\u00f6rkdal deposit. 2023 exploration focused on veining to the north of Aurora above the marble horizon however with some keen incites from Bj\u00f6rkdal geologists, the focus moved to below marble where, with targeting success, a significant portion of drilling through 2024 has continued. Further to the south and along the eastern flank of the mine, the eastern extension of Main Zone has been a major source of exploration success and Reserve growth over the past years. In 2024, drilling in this area continued with an infill program targeting previously identified Inferred resources. Additionally, and as appropriate drilling horizons became available, drilling continued to test the extensions of Aurora to the east and at depth. (see Figure 1). Figure 1. Perspective view of the Bj\u00f6rkdal Mine looking towards the SW highlighting the interaction of the veining (Red), marble (Blue) and Bj\u00f6rkdal fault (Yellow). Drilling from the 2024 near mine programs are displayed. (CNW Group/Mandalay Resources Corporation) North Zone Below Marble Since late 2023 a total of 14 holes have been drilled from underground workings to the northwest intercepting a series of quartz veins. We are very excited that these veins are interpreted to be largely continuous through the tested areas and, in many instances, exhibit visible gold. Above the marble horizon, to the south of this discovery, the Aurora system was the dominant feature and veining directly below Aurora was sparse. Through analytical work, and forward modelling of kinematic indicators, Mandalay geologists came to the understanding that further north should be a conducive environment for gold endowment within the Bj\u00f6rkdal deposit. This body of work also anticipates the presence of further fault structures at depth that mimic the important role in mineralisation that the Bj\u00f6rkdal shear plays through much of the deposit. This means that the veining with the North Zone Below Marble domain is likely to exhibit larger vertical extents. Within the 14 holes drilled, a total of 193 significant sample composites have been assayed across 18 veins currently interpreted. In addition to these stated drilling highlights, this program has also produced 43.9 grams per tonne gold over a length of 1.10 m (ETW 0.71 m in MU24-006, 6.1 grams per tonne gold over a length of 3.85 m (ETW 3.62 m in MU24-008 and 42.9 grams per tonne gold over a length of 0.80 m (ETW 0.69 m in MU24-024. (Figure 2.) Figure 2. Plan section of North Zone below marble showing 2024 drilling and newly located veining. Intercepts above 0.5 g/t Au when diluted to 1 m are denoted by dots. Drillholes are annotated with composites over 2.0 g/t Au when diluted to 1 m. (CNW Group/Mandalay Resources Corporation) Core drilled during the program has been oriented so that further structural analyses can be undertaken. Veining is shown to be largely vertical to northwest dipping in geometry and consists largely of quartz with varying amounts of scheelite, tsumoite and of course, visible gold (Figure 3). Figure 3. Photograph of core from MU24-010 (178.9 g/t gold over 1.15 m (ETW 0.94 m) with insert showing close-up of visible gold and Tsumoite at 518.75m down hole. (CNW Group/Mandalay Resources Corporation) Unfortunatly the drill rigs used for this campaign were limited in their drill capacity and many of the drill holes ended within the mineral domain, hence the domain is still open further to the northwest, southwest and at depth. As we progress underground development deeper within Aurora, more appropriate drilling platforms will be made available to ensure greater extent and ideal orientations maximised. Drilling to test the limits of this new domain is expected to commence in 2025. Main Zone Infill Drilling (part of Eastern Extension) The Bj\u00f6rkdal deposit is split into a number of domains based on mineralisation characteristics. Main Zone has been a consistent source of higher-grade ore since underground production commenced in 2008. Veining within the domain terminates at its upper extent at the Bj\u00f6rkdal shear however it is open down plunge to the east. Since 2021, Main Zone has been explored and extended to the east through a series of drilling campaigns. In 2024, an infill drilling program was executed targeting the Inferred resource discovered in 2023. The drilling confirmed gold bearing veins that are typical of the Main Zone with encouraging assay results returned. Some highlights, additional to the previously stated, are 16.8 grams per tonne gold over a length of 3.1 m (ETW 0.8 m in MU24-018 and 59.3 grams per tonne gold over a length of 0.40 m (ETW 0.35 m in MU24-022. (Figure 4) Figure 4. Plan section of the Main Zone infill drilling. Intercepts above 0.5 g/t Au when diluted to 1 m are denoted by dots. Drillholes are annotated with composites over 2.0 g/t Au when diluted to 1 m. (CNW Group/Mandalay Resources Corporation) The veining within the infill drilling presents as the characteristic sub vertical sheeted arrays with some crosscutting veining evident. Mineralization also looks typical of Main Zone with visible gold located in a number of intercepts alongside sulphide minerals such at pyrite and pyrrhotite with scheelite and bismuth telluride compounds also present. Figure 5. Photograph of core from MU24-018 (16.8 g/t gold over 3.10 m (ETW 0.80 m). (CNW Group/Mandalay Resources Corporation) Due to the eastward plunge of Main Zone and the positioning of mine development, the further testing of veining becomes difficult with less desirable angles of intercept when targeting above 250 metres from development, therefore further extension drilling awaits mine development progression and dedicated drilling positions. The deposit however does not show signs of lessening grade and it is still open down plunge to the east. Aurora Deeps Since production began from Aurora in 2018, the Aurora domain has been a significant source of bulk tonnage for Bj\u00f6rkdal with some stopes extending to over 10 metres in width. At the heart of the domain is the Aurora orebody itself which is hosted within a pre-existing shear and consists of a range mineralisation characteristics with gold bearing veinlet arrays grading to massive quartz veins. This orebody is accompanied both in the hanging and footwall by northwest dipping quartz veins that also carry gold. The 2024 drilling campaign looked to extend Aurora mineralisation to the east. This program was successful in finding eastward continuation approximately 200 metres from current development. Two intercepts standout as significant grades within this area and are likely to be the continuation of Aurora mineralisation. These are 3.4 grams per tonne gold over 7.40 m (ETW 3.70 m ) in MU24-004 and 3.9 grams per tonne gold over 2.70 m (ETW 1.70 m ) in MU24-001. (Figure 6.) Figure 6. Plan section of the Aurora Deeps Extension drilling. Intercepts above 0.5 g/t Au when diluted to 1 m are denoted by dots. Drillholes are annotated with composites over 2.0 g/t Au when diluted to 1 m. (CNW Group/Mandalay Resources Corporation) Consistent with Aurora, the veining is of greater width then other domains within Bj\u00f6rkdal and exhibits free gold within quartz (Figure 7). In general, however there is a lower amount of veining surrounding the Aurora intercepts at this point. Continued drilling will look to infill and further extend Aurora to the east. Figure 7. Photograph of core from MU24-004 (3.4 g/t gold over 7.40 m (ETW 3.70 m). (CNW Group/Mandalay Resources Corporation) In 2025 Mandalay will continue to explore both the underground northern and eastern extensions of the Bj\u00f6rkdal deposit into these areas of high potential as appropriate drill horizons become available. This near mine exploration will be accompanied by further surface drilling as Mandalay builds its knowledge around the exciting and expanding Storheden and Norrberget deposits (reported in April and May of 2024) that have the potential \u00a0to be significant additions to Bj\u00f6rkdal's future. Drilling and Assaying At Bj\u00f6rkdal, all diamond drill core was logged and sampled by Bj\u00f6rkdal geologists. Exploration drill hole samples were sent to CRS Laboratories Oy (\"CRS\") in Kempele, Finland for sample preparation and assaying. Assaying was conducted utilizing the Pal1000 cyanide leaching processes. Mandalay's rigorous QA/QC program included the use of standard reference samples, blanks, duplicates, repeats, and internal laboratory quality assurance procedures.

Metres @ 6.0 G/T Gold (Uncut) Traversing 8 High-Grade Veins in Down Dip Extension at Sunday Creek Mawson Gold Limited Wed, Dec 18, 2024, 2:30 PM 28 min read In This Article: MWSNF 0.00% Mawson Gold Limited (\"Mawson\" or the \"Company\") (TSXV:MAW)(Frankfurt:MXR)(OTC PINK:MWSNF) announces Southern Cross Gold Ltd. (\"Southern Cross Gold\" or \"SXG\") has released results from two drill holes from the Rising Sun prospect at its 100%-owned Sunday Creek Gold-Antimony Project in Victoria. High Level Take Away: Southern Cross Gold's latest drilling results from the Sunday Creek Project in Victoria demonstrate the project's expanding high-grade potential and size adding four new >100 g/t AuEq * m intercepts to the project within a single drill hole. Drill hole SDDSC144 delivered exceptional results with 242.1 m @ 6.0 g/t gold (uncut) , including multiple bonanza-grade intersections across eight distinct high-grade vein sets. Most notably, the hole produced one of the project's highest-grade intersections to date: 0.16 m at 3,352.0 g/t AuEq (3,330.0 g/t Au, 11.7% Sb), ranking as the seventh-best composite interval in project history and 3.6 m @ 117.3 g/t AuEq (114.6 g/t Au, 1.4% Sb). Of equal significance, SDDSC129, the deepest hole drilled to date at Sunday Creek (1,269.8 m), successfully extended known mineralisation and served as a crucial control hole for SDDSC144. The hole's high-grade intersection at 1,238.6 m (1.5 m @ 21.5 g/t AuEq) proves mineralisation extends 100 m down-dip from previous intersections. This depth extension, combined with the project's improving predictability of high-grade intersections, suggests significant exploration upside remains. The results reinforce the conclusion that Sunday Creek has become a very significant epizonal gold-antimony system, similar to other major Victorian deposits such as Fosterville and Costerfield. With antimony recognised as a critical mineral by major economies and China recently imposing export restrictions, Sunday Creek's antimony content (which represents approximately 20% of in-situ recoverable value) adds strategic importance to the project. The Company's systematic drill program, currently employing five rigs with plans to drill 60,000 m through Q3 2025, continues to expand the known mineralisation along strike and at depth. For Those Who Like the Details: SDDSC144 drilled 242.1 m @ 6.0 g/t gold (uncut) traversing eight high-grade vein sets and delivered the seventh best intercept on the Sunday Creek project, 0.16 m @ 3,352.0 g/t AuEq (3,330.0 g/t Au, 11.7% Sb) . The hole included 10 intervals >100 g/t Au (up to 3,330.0 g/t Au), four intervals >2% Sb (up to 11.7% Sb) and added four new >100 g/t AuEq x m intercepts to the project. Selected highlights include: 15.7 m @ 12.0 g/t AuEq (11.4 g/t Au, 0.3% Sb) from 567.1 m, including: 4.1 m @ 40.8 g/t AuEq (40.2 g/t Au, 0.3% Sb) from 568.9 m 0.7 m @ 193.5 g/t AuEq (193.4 g/t Au, 0.1% Sb) from 609.3 m 0.5 m @ 87.1 g/t AuEq (84.8 g/t Au, 1.2% Sb) from 632.5 m, including: 0.2 m @ 210.6 g/t AuEq (206.0 g/t Au, 2.5% Sb) from 632.5 m 5.8 m @ 4.8 g/t AuEq (4.3 g/t Au, 0.3% Sb) from 659.4 m, including: 0.4 m @ 56.8 g/t AuEq (56.1 g/t Au, 0.4% Sb) from 664.8 m 3.6 m @ 18.2 g/t AuEq (18.2 g/t Au, 0.0% Sb) from 697.4 m including: 1.2m @ 55.3 g/t AuEq (55.2 g/t Au, 0.1% Sb) from 697.4 m 3.6 m @ 117.3 g/t AuEq (114.6 g/t Au, 1.4% Sb) from 748.8 m, including: 0.6 m @ 653.6 g/t AuEq (639.8 g/t Au, 7.3% Sb) from 751.8 m 0.16 m @ 3,352.0 g/t AuEq (3,330.0 g/t Au, 11.7% Sb) from 776.6 m SDDSC129 is the deepest hole on the project at 1,269.8 m with high-grade mineralisation present at 1,238.6 m (1.5 m @ 21.5 g/t AuEq (21.5 g/t Au, 0.0% Sb). Selected highlights include: 0.8 m @ 8.4 g/t AuEq (8.4 g/t Au, 0.0% Sb) from 890.7 m 0.9 m @ 4.9 g/t AuEq (4.9 g/t Au, 0.0% Sb) from 1,079.2 m 1.5 m @ 21.5 g/t AuEq (21.5 g/t Au, 0.0% Sb) from 1,238.6 m, including: 0.8 m @ 36.6 g/t AuEq (36.6 g/t Au, 0.0% Sb) from 1,239.3 m Ongoing Exploration: Thirteen holes are currently being processed and analysed, with five holes in progress (Figures 1 and 2). Mawson owns 96,590,910 shares of SXG (48.7%), valuing its stake at A$379.6 million (C$344.3 million) based on SXG's closing price on December 17, 2024 AEDT. SDDSC129 is the deepest hole on the project at 1,269.8 m with high-grade mineralisation present at 1,238.6 m (1.5 m @ 21.5 g/t AuEq (21.5 g/t Au, 0.0% Sb). Selected highlights include: Story Continues Michael Hudson, Mawson Interim CEO and Executive Chairman, states : \"In a remarkable two-month span, SXG has hit the ultimate year-end quadrella at Sunday Creek, delivering extraordinary high-grade intersections across four distinct prospect areas. The sequential discoveries showcase the deposit's expansive high-grade nature over more than 1 km, starting with Christina's 1.7 m @ 254.0 g/t AuEq (9 th best intersection), followed by Golden Dyke's broad 5.5 m @ 26.1 g/t AuEq, then culminating in two bonanza-grade hits: Apollo's 0.5 m @ 2,544.0 g/t AuEq (4 th best) and Rising Sun's 0.16 m @ 3,352.0 g/t AuEq (7 th best) . This success across multiple prospect areas, yielding three top ten intersections in the project's history, validates the robust nature of the mineralisation system and highlights the effectiveness of the company's structural targeting methodology in this high-grade epizonal gold-antimony system. \"Today's results continue to demonstrate the exceptional high-grade nature and expanding scale of the Sunday Creek mineralised system. SDDSC144 has delivered outstanding results including 242.1 m at 6.0 g/t Au (uncut) , traversing eight distinct high-grade vein sets. Most notably, SDDSC144 produced one of our highest-grade intersections to date with 0.16 m @ 3,330 g/t Au intersected within a deep high-grade zone of this impressive epizonal system. Many of the other 8 vein sets in the same drill hole reported wide and high-grade results including 4.1 m @ 40.2 g/t Au and 3.6 m @ 114.6 g/t Au . In addition, SDDSC129, our deepest hole to date at 1,270 m, successfully extended known mineralisation with significant high-grade gold intersections up to 100 m below previously drilled mineralisation. \"With five drill rigs currently operating and plans to drill 60,000 m through to Q3 2025, we are well-positioned to continue expanding this remarkable epizonal gold-antimony system, which grows more impressive with each new result.\" Drill Hole Discussion Results from drill holes SDDSC129 and SDDSC144 (Figures 1 and 2) are announced here from the Rising Sun prospect at the 100%-owned Sunday Creek Gold-Antimony Project in Victoria (Figure 4). Drill hole SDDSC144 delivered outstanding results at Sunday Creek, intercepting multiple high-grade gold-antimony veins across a 270 m prospective corridor. The hole, which was strategically drilled parallel to the dyke/breccia/altered sediment host and at a high angle to the mineralised vein sets, returned a 242.1 m @ 6.0 g/t gold (uncut) traversing eight distinct high-grade vein sets. Five vein sets represent down-dip extensions of 25 m to 55 m and three are infill intersections. Highlights included 3.6 m @ 117.3 g/t AuEq (114.6 g/t Au, 1.4% Sb) from 748.8 m (Photo 1) and most notably, the hole produced one of the project's highest-grade intersections to date, returning 0.16 m at 3,352.0 g/t AuEq (3,330.0 g/t Au, 11.7% Sb) from 776.6 m (Photo 2), ranking as the seventh-best composite interval and containing the fourth-highest gold assay in the project's history. The high-grade nature of mineralisation is further demonstrated by ten intervals exceeding 100 g/t Au , with values up to 3,330.0 g/t Au, and four intervals containing more than 2% antimony, reaching a maximum of 11.7% Sb. The hole has significantly contributed to the project's high-grade inventory, adding four new >100 g/t AuEq * m intercepts and one intersection in the 50 to 100 g/t AuEq * m range (at a 2.0 m @ 1.0 g/t AuEq cutoff), bringing the project total to fifty-four high-grade intersections. These results continue to demonstrate the high-grade nature and expanding scale of the Sunday Creek mineralised system, with successful extensions of known mineralised shapes and the discovery of new high-grade vein sets within the exploration target area. Extended highlights for SDDSC144 include: 3.4 m @ 1.8 g/t AuEq (1.1 g/t Au, 0.3% Sb) from 545.3 m 6.3 m @ 2.5 g/t AuEq (1.7 g/t Au, 0.4% Sb) from 554.0 m 15.7 m @ 12.0 g/t AuEq (11.4 g/t Au, 0.3% Sb) from 567.1 m, including: 4.1 m @ 40.8 g/t AuEq (40.2 g/t Au, 0.3% Sb) from 568.9 m 1.9 m @ 2.4 g/t AuEq (1.8 g/t Au, 0.3% Sb) from 591.7 m 1.0 m @ 4.0 g/t AuEq (3.9 g/t Au, 0.0% Sb) from 596.6 m 0.7 m @ 193.5 g/t AuEq (193.4 g/t Au, 0.1% Sb) from 609.3 m 0.5 m @ 87.1 g/t AuEq (84.8 g/t Au, 1.2% Sb) from 632.5 m, including: 0.2 m @ 210.6 g/t AuEq (206.0 g/t Au, 2.5% Sb) from 632.5 m 3.7 m @ 1.5 g/t AuEq (0.9 g/t Au, 0.3% Sb) from 638.0 m 0.5 m @ 7.7 g/t AuEq (7.6 g/t Au, 0.1% Sb) from 650.0 m 1.0 m @ 4.2 g/t AuEq (3.9 g/t Au, 0.2% Sb) from 656.0 m 5.8 m @ 4.8 g/t AuEq (4.3 g/t Au, 0.3% Sb) from 659.4 m, including: 0.4 m @ 56.8 g/t AuEq (56.1 g/t Au, 0.4% Sb) from 664.8 m 3.6 m @ 18.2 g/t AuEq (18.2 g/t Au, 0.0% Sb) from 697.4 m, including: 1.2 m @ 55.3 g/t AuEq (55.2 g/t Au, 0.1% Sb) from 697.4 m 1.2 m @ 2.7 g/t AuEq (2.5 g/t Au, 0.1% Sb) from 719.5 m 2.2 m @ 1.4 g/t AuEq (1.3 g/t Au, 0.0% Sb) from 733.9 m 2.8 m @ 0.8 g/t AuEq (0.7 g/t Au, 0.1% Sb) from 743.5 m 3.6 m @ 117.3 g/t AuEq (114.6 g/t Au, 1.4% Sb) from 748.8 m, including: 0.6 m @ 653.6 g/t AuEq (639.8 g/t Au, 7.3% Sb) from 751.8 m 0.16 m @ 3,352.0 g/t AuEq (3,330.0 g/t Au, 11.7% Sb) from 776.6 m Drill hole SDDSC129 is the deepest hole (1,269.8 m) drilled to date at Sunday Creek, successfully extended known mineralisation. The hole served as a crucial control hole for SDDSC144, effectively defining the system's southern margins and leading to the discovery of high-grade mineralisation 30 m north of the subsequently drilled SDDSC144. Mineralisation remains open to the north of SDDSC144. SDDSC129 intercepted three distinct high-grade vein sets. The most significant intersection returned 1.5 m @ 21.5 g/t AuEq (21.5 g/t Au, 0.0% Sb) from 1,238.6 m, representing the equal-deepest high-grade intercept on the project to date. This intersection is significant, extending mineralization 100 m down-dip from previous drilling. The hole extended known mineralisation by 52 m below SDDSC118 (which returned 3.6 m @ 124.8 g/t AuEq from 1,120.4 m). The high-grade nature of the mineralisation is demonstrated by six intervals exceeding 5 g/t Au, with values reaching up to 56.3 g/t Au. Extended highlights include: 1.1 m @ 2.8 g/t AuEq (2.8 g/t Au, 0.0% Sb) from 826.1 m 1.6 m @ 1.3 g/t AuEq (1.3 g/t Au, 0.0% Sb) from 830.2 m 0.8 m @ 8.4 g/t AuEq (8.4 g/t Au, 0.0% Sb) from 890.7 m 0.9 m @ 4.9 g/t AuEq (4.9 g/t Au, 0.0% Sb) from 1,079.2 m 1.5 m @ 21.5 g/t AuEq (21.5 g/t Au, 0.0% Sb) from 1,238.6 m, including: 0.8 m @ 36.6 g/t AuEq (36.6 g/t Au, 0.0% Sb) from 1,239.3 m 1.6 m @ 1.8 g/t AuEq (1.8 g/t Au, 0.0% Sb) from 1,243.1 m Pending Results and Update Thirteen holes (SDDSC120W1, 140, 142, 146, 146W1, 147-151, 153, 155, 157) are currently being processed and analyzed, with five holes (SDDSC149W1, 152, 154, 155A, 157A) in progress (Figures 1 and 2). Further Information No upper gold grade cut is applied in the averaging and intervals are reported as drill thickness. However, during future Mineral Resource studies, the requirement for assay top cutting will be assessed. The Company notes that due to rounding of assay results to one significant figure, minor variations in calculated composite grades may occur. Figures 1 to 4 show project location, plan and longitudinal views of drill results reported here and Tables 2 to 4 provide collar and assay data. The true thickness of the mineralized intervals reported individually as estimated true widths (\"ETW\"), otherwise they are interpreted to be approximately 25% to 50% of the sampled thickness for other reported holes. Lower grades were cut at 1.0 g/t AuEq lower cutoff over a maximum width of 2 m with higher grades cut at 5.0 g/t AuEq lower cutoff over a maximum of 1 m width unless specified unless otherwise* specified to demonstrate higher grade assays. About Sunday Creek The Sunday Creek epizonal-style gold project is located 60 km north of Melbourne within 16,900 hectares (\"Ha\") of granted exploration tenements. SXG is also the freehold landholder of 133.29 Ha that form the key portion in and around the main drilled area at the Sunday Creek Project and is closing on a 921.22 Ha (total 1,054.51 Ha or 2,605.8 acres) subject to Foreign Investment Board (\"FIRB\") approval. Gold and antimony form in a relay of vein sets that cut across a steeply dipping zone of intensely altered rocks (the \"host\"). When observed from above, the host resembles the side rails of a ladder, where the sub-vertical mineralized vein sets are the rungs that extend from surface to depth. At Apollo and Rising Sun these individual \u2018rungs' have been defined over 600 m depth extent from surface to 1,100 m below surface, are 2.5 m to 3.5 m wide (median widths) (and up to 10 m), and 20 m to 100 m in strike. Cumulatively, 154 drill holes for 69,693.69 m have been reported by SXG (and Mawson Gold Ltd) from Sunday Creek since late 2020. An additional 12 holes for 582.55 m from Sunday Creek were abandoned due to deviation or hole conditions. Fourteen drillholes for 2,383 m have been reported regionally outside of the main Sunday Creek drill area. A total of 64 historic drill holes for 5,599 m were completed from the late 1960s to 2008. The project now contains a total of fifty-four (54) >100 g/t AuEq x m and fifty-nine (59) >50 to 100 g/t AuEq x m drill holes by applying a 2 m @ 1 g/t lower cut. Our systematic drill program is strategically targeting these significant vein formations, initially these have been defined over 1,350 m strike of the host from Christina to Apollo prospects, of which approximately 620 m has been more intensively drill tested (Rising Sun to Apollo). At least 67 \u2018rungs' have been defined to date, defined by high-grade intercepts (20 g/t to >7,330 g/t Au) along with lower grade edges. Ongoing step-out drilling is aiming to uncover the potential extent of this mineralized system (Figure 3). Geologically, the project is located within the Melbourne Structural Zone in the Lachlan Fold Belt. The regional host to the Sunday Creek mineralization is an interbedded turbidite sequence of siltstones and minor sandstones metamorphosed to sub-greenschist facies and folded into a set of open north-west trending fold. Further Information Further discussion and analysis of the Sunday Creek project by Southern Cross Gold is available on the SXG website at www.southerncrossgold.com.au . Critical Metal Epizonal Gold-Antimony Deposits Sunday Creek (Figure 4) is an epizonal gold-antimony deposit formed in the late Devonian (like Fosterville, Costerfield and Redcastle), 60 million years later than mesozonal gold systems formed in Victoria (for example Ballarat and Bendigo). Epizonal deposits are a form of orogenic gold deposit classified according to their depth of formation: epizonal (<6 km), mesozonal (6-12 km) and hypozonal (>12 km). Epizonal deposits in Victoria often have associated high levels of the critical metal, antimony, and Sunday Creek is no exception. China claims a 56 per cent share of global mined supplies of antimony, according to a 2023 European Union study. Antimony features highly on the critical minerals lists of many countries including Australia, the United States of America, Canada, Japan and the European Union. Australia ranks seventh for antimony production despite all production coming from a single mine at Costerfield in Victoria, located nearby to all SXG projects. Antimony alloys with lead and tin which results in improved properties for solders, munitions, bearings and batteries. Antimony is a prominent additive for halogen-containing flame retardants. Adequate supplies of antimony are critical to the world's energy transition, and to the high-tech industry, especially the semi-conductor and defence sectors where it is a critical additive to primers in munitions. The Chinese government placed export limits on September 15, 2024 on six antimony-related products. Additionally, the new policy bans gold-antimony smelting separation technology exports without permission from the ministry. This week China further ratcheted up supply pressure, imposing an outright ban on exports of gallium, germanium and antimony to the United States. This puts pressure on Western defence supply chains and negatively affect the supply of the metal and push up pricing given China's dominance of the supply of the metal in the global markets. This is positive for SXG as we are likely to have one of the very few large and high-quality projects of antimony in the western world that can feed western demand into the future. Antimony represents approximately 20% in situ recoverable value of Sunday Creek at the gold equivalent calculation described below. Technical Background and Qualified Person The Qualified Person, Michael Hudson, Executive Chairman and a director of Mawson Gold, and a Fellow of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, has reviewed, verified and approved the technical contents of this release. Analytical samples are transported to the Bendigo facility of On Site Laboratory Services (\"On Site\") which operates under both an ISO 9001 and NATA quality systems. Samples were prepared and analyzed for gold using the fire assay technique (PE01S method; 25 gram charge), followed by measuring the gold in solution with flame AAS equipment. Samples for multi-element analysis (BM011 and over-range methods as required) use aqua regia digestion and ICP-MS analysis. The QA/QC program of Southern Cross Gold consists of the systematic insertion of certified standards of known gold content, blanks within interpreted mineralized rock and quarter core duplicates. In addition, On Site inserts blanks and standards into the analytical process. MAW considers that both gold and antimony that are included in the gold equivalent calculation (\"AuEq\") have reasonable potential to be recovered at Sunday Creek, given current geochemical understanding, historic production statistics and geologically analogous mining operations. Historically, ore from Sunday Creek was treated onsite or shipped to the Costerfield mine, located 54 km to the northwest of the project, for processing during WW1. The Costerfield mine corridor, now owned by Mandalay Resources Ltd contains two million ounces of equivalent gold (Mandalay Q3 2021 Results), and in 2020 was the sixth highest-grade global underground mine and a top 5 global producer of antimony. MAW considers that it is appropriate to adopt the same gold equivalent variables as Mandalay Resources Ltd in its Mandalay Technical Report, 2024 dated March 28, 2024. The gold equivalence formula used by Mandalay Resources was calculated using Costerfield's 2023 production costs, using a gold price of US$1,900 per ounce, an antimony price of US$12,000 per tonne and 2023 total year metal recoveries of 94% for gold and 89% for antimony, and is as follows: \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc5e = \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc62 (\ud835\udc54/\ud835\udc61) + 1.88 \u00d7 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc4f (%). Based on the latest Costerfield calculation and given the similar geological styles and historic toll treatment of Sunday Creek mineralization at Costerfield, SXG considers that a \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc5e = \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc62 (\ud835\udc54/\ud835\udc61) + 1.88 \u00d7 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc4f (%) is appropriate to use for the initial exploration targeting of gold-antimony mineralization at Sunday Creek.

Kingfisher remains open at depth for most of the drilled 2-kilometer strike, with the deepest drilling only testing to approximately 250 meters below surface (refer to Figure 2). Mineralization at Kingfisher demonstrates a clear association with the strongly deformed contact zone between a series of felsic intrusives, quartz veining, and host basaltic units. The change in strike orientation along the structure from north-south to north-east coincides with the higher grade, broader mineralization intervals. Mineralization is characterized by silica-biotite-sericite-carbonate alteration and pyrite development within and adjacent to the quartz veining. Two drill rigs will continue working into the second quarter of 2025 to support resource infill drilling for resource conversion as well as drilling for depth and strike extensions. Figure 1: S\u00e9gu\u00e9la Mine deposit locations S\u00e9gu\u00e9la Mine deposit locations Figure 2: Kingfisher deposit long-section - looking west Kingfisher deposit long-section - looking west Sunbird deposit At Sunbird, results from a further 24 holes, totaling 9,065 meters of a planned 12,000-meter drilling program have been received, with several high grades returned including 20.4 g/t Au over an estimated true width of 19.6 meters from 397 meters in drill hole SGRD2099 (refer to Figure 3). The program is designed to infill and extend the current mineralized footprint as part of a program to evaluate underground mining potential, with mineralization remaining open more than 600 meters below surface, or more than 800 meters down plunge from the margin of the planned open pit. The most recent drill hole, which stepped out 150 meters to the south of the reported drilling and for which assays are pending, reported more than 15 points of visible gold (VG) associated with extensive alteration and quartz veining over an interval of 28 meters. Drilling will continue into the first half of 2025 to support an updated resource model and underground mining studies.

Quality Assurance & Quality Control (QA - QC) All drilling data completed by the Company utilized the following procedures and methodologies. All drilling was carried out under the supervision of the Company\u2019s personnel. All reverse circulation (RC) drilling used a 5.25-inch face sampling pneumatic hammer with samples collected into 60-liter plastic bags. Samples were kept dry by maintaining enough air pressure to exclude groundwater inflow. If water ingress exceeded the air pressure, RC drilling was stopped, and drilling converted to diamond core tails. Once collected, RC samples were riffle split through a three-tier splitter to yield a 12.5 percent representative sample for submission to the analytical laboratory. The residual 87.5 percent samples were stored at the drill site until assay results were received and validated. Coarse reject samples for all mineralized samples corresponding to significant intervals are retained and stored on-site at the Company-controlled core yard. All diamond drilling (DD) drill holes started with HQ sized diameter, before reducing to NQ diameter diamond drill bits on intersecting fresh rock. The core was logged, marked up for sampling using standard lengths of one meter or to a geological boundary. Samples were then cut into equal halves using a diamond saw. One half of the core was left in the original core box and stored in a secure location at the Company core yard at the project site. The other half was sampled, catalogued, and placed into sealed bags and securely stored at the site until shipment. All RC and DD samples were transported to ALS\u2019s preparation laboratory in Yamoussoukro, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, before also being transported via commercial courier, to ALS\u2019s facility in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Routine gold analysis using a 50-gram charge and fire assay with an atomic absorption finish was completed for all samples. Quality control procedures included the systematic insertion of blanks, duplicates and sample standards into the sample stream. In addition, the ALS laboratory inserted its own quality control samples.

Corp. Wed, Dec 11, 2024, 3:45 PM 13 min read In This Article: FMT.V -1.09% Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - December 11, 2024) - Fuerte Metals Corporation (TSXV: FMT) (OTCQB: FUEMF) (\" Fuerte \" or the \" Company \") is pleased to report results from the most recent five holes of a diamond drilling program at its wholly-owned Cristina precious metals project in southwestern Chihuahua State, Mexico. Fuerte has now reported thirty holes totalling 7,936.5 metres of drilling as part of a 40-50 hole, 21,000 metre drill program. The Cristina project consists of multiple outcropping quartz veins that are frequently greater than 10 metres in width and extend for at least a five-kilometre strike length. Four parallel mineralized vein zones have been mapped and sampled to date, with most of the existing mineral resource estimate at Cristina contained within only one of the vein zones, the Guadalupe vein (Figure 1). These latest results are widely spaced expansion holes from two additional vein areas, Los Ingleses and Mexico Libre. The two holes reported from Los Ingleses are located approximately 2 km to the north of the Guadalupe vein system, while the three holes reported here from Mexico Libre are approximately 800 m NE of Guadalupe (Figure 1). Drilling Highlights Highlights of the holes reported here, from the Los Ingleses and Mexico Libre vein systems, include: 7.5 g/t AuEq over 2.8 m estimated true width (ETW) (1.9 g/t Au, 67 g/t Ag, 6.81% Zn, 1.06% Pb and 0.42% Cu) in hole ACD-24-247 in the Los Ingleses vein system This 2.8 m wide intercept occurs within a broader mineralized zone measuring 3.8 g/t AuEq over 9.0 m ETW (1.5 g/t Au, 42 g/t Ag, 2.48% Zn, 0.48 % Pb, 0.18% Cu) 7.5 g/t AuEq over 7.5 m ETW (5.3 g/t Au, 40 g/t Ag, 1.98% Zn, 1.01% Pb and 0.16% Cu) in hole ACD-24-248 in the Mexico Libre vein system This 7.5 m wide intercept occurs within a broader mineralized zone measuring 3.6 g/t AuEq over 17.5 m ETW (2.4 g/t Au, 23 g/t Ag, 1.00% Zn, 0.49 % Pb, 0.08% Cu) 8.1 g/t AuEq over 0.8 m ETW (2.7 g/t Au, 39 g/t Ag, 7.66% Zn, 1.58 % Pb, 0.15% Cu) in hole ACD-24-249 in the Mexico Libre vein system 14.3 g/t AuEq over 3.0 m ETW (8.6 g/t Au, 91 g/t Ag, 6.16% Zn, 1.41 % Pb, 0.40% Cu) in hole ACD-24-250 in the Mexico Libre vein system Tim Warman, Atacama's CEO, commented: \"The Los Ingleses and Mexico Libre veins have seen very little drilling to date, so it's especially encouraging to see multiple high-grade intercepts from both these areas, especially the gold-rich intercepts at Mexico Libre. The current drilling program has been extremely successful thus far in discovering, defining and extending the higher-grade zones that we've encountered in all the vein systems we've drilled to date. These multiple higher-grade zones will form the basis for the underground resource estimate that will follow completion of the 21,000 m drilling program in Q3 of next year.\" Story Continues Geology and Context of Results Holes ACD-24-246 and -247 were drilled as part of a seven hole pattern on the Los Ingleses vein system (Figure 2): ACD-24-246 encountered a narrow zone of mineralisation beneath previous higher-grade intercepts in ACD-24-245, as seen on section A-A' (Figures 2 & 3) and defines the base of a newly discovered high-grade zone open to the east ACD-24-247 is the most westerly of the recent holes at Los Ingleses and shows one of the best intercepts to date from this vein, with 7.5 g/t AuEq over 2.8 m ETW. This hole is the only one on this section, and there is an almost 1.4 km untested gap to the west of ACD-24-247. Mineralisation remains open both vertically and along strike to the west (Figures 2 & 4) in this second newly discovered high-grade zone at Los Ingleses. Holes ACD-24-248, -249 and -250 were drilled as part of a five-hole pattern along approximately 380 metres of strike length on the Mexico Libre vein (Figure 5). ACD-24-248 encountered a wide zone of high-grade, gold-rich mineralization (7.5 g/t AuEq over 7.5 m ETW) that can be traced for at least 150 m along strike from previous holes ACD-19-121 (17.1 g/t AuEq over 1.5 m ETW) in the west to ACD-19-103 (15.2 g/t AuEq over 3.6 m ETW) in the east. This drill hole adds confidence to the continuity of this high-grade body, with potential for additional high-grade bodies along strike. (Figures 5 & 7). ACD-24-249 was drilled approximately 130 m southwest of ACD-24-248 and intercepted a narrower zone of high-grade mineralisation (8.1 g/t AuEq over 0.8 m ETW) in the Mexico Libre vein (Figures 5 & 6). This intercept expands the high-grade body to the west for a total strike length of over 250 metres. ACD-24-250 was collared 90 m NE of ACD-24-248 and intercepted 14.3 g/t AuEq over 3.0 m ETW, demonstrating the continuity of this gold rich zone along strike and adding confidence in the high-grade body towards its eastern end. (Figures 5 & 8). The thirty holes completed to date in 2024 have successfully defined a series of continuous higher-grade zones extending over several hundred vertical metres within the main Guadalupe vein, and now within the Los Ingleses and Mexico Libre vein systems. These higher-grade zones remain open along strike and at depth. The Cristina deposit is an epithermal to mesothermal vein system where the mineralisation is predominantly gold and silver, with lesser base metal values. At least four known parallel vein zones trend east-west to northeast-southwest and are hosted in an andesitic volcanic sequence which forms part of the Lower Volcanic Sequence of the Sierra Madre Occidental range. The andesites are intercalated locally with dacitic intrusions and related lava flows and breccias, and the sequence is in turn cut by andesitic and hornblende-plagioclase porphyry following fault trends. In some areas the veins are covered by post-mineral rhyolite of the Upper Volcanic Sequence. Figure 1 - Known vein systems and existing drill holes at the Cristina Project .

The goal of targeting the higher-grade zones within the main Guadalupe Vein, as well as other high-grade veins in the area, is to both increase the size and the grade of the resource and demonstrate the underground resource potential at Cristina. The current, primarily open-pit mineral resource estimate comprises: Indicated resources of 17.5 Mt at 0.51 g/t gold, 33.8 g/t silver, 0.47% zinc, 0.19% lead and 0.04% copper (1.33 g/t AuEq grade), for a contained 752,000 gold-equivalent ounces. Inferred resources of 19.0 Mt at 0.51 g/t gold, 27.5 g/t silver, 0.50% zinc, 0.19% lead and 0.05% copper (1.27 g/t AuEq grade), for a contained 777,000 gold-equivalent ounces. Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. Quality Assurance and Quality Control Procedures Drill core at the Cristina project is predominately HQ size with a diameter of 63.5 mm. Drill core samples are generally 1.50 m long along the core axis with allowance for shorter or longer intervals if required to suit geological constraints. After logging intervals are identified to be sampled, the core is cut and one half is submitted for assay. Sample QA/QC measures include unmarked certified reference materials, blanks, and field duplicates are inserted into the sample sequence and make up approximately 5% of the samples submitted to the laboratory for each drill hole. Samples are transported to lab facilities in Durango or Hermosillo Mexico, for sample preparation. Sample analysis is carried out by ALS Labs, with fire assay, including over limits fire assay re-analysis, and multi-element analysis completed in North Vancouver, Canada. Drill core sample preparation includes fine crushing of the sample to at least 70% passing less than 2 mm, sample splitting using a riffle splitter, and pulverizing a 250-gram split to at least 85% passing 75 microns. Gold in diamond drill core is analyzed by fire assay and atomic absorption spectroscopy of a 30 g sample (Au-AA25). Multi-element chemistry is analyzed by 4-Acid digestion of a 0.25-gram sample split (ME-ICP61) with detection by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer for a full suite of elements.

Intersection is over 400m from main Guadalupe East resource area and is comprised of 14 g/t gold and 2,150 g/t silver VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Dec. 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Prime Mining Corp. (\u201cPrime\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d)\u00a0(TSX: PRYM) (OTCQX: PRMNF) ( Frankfurt: 04V3) is reporting expansion drilling results from the Company\u2019s Los Reyes Project (the \u201cProject\u201d), located in Sinaloa State, Mexico. These results are from 2024 drilling at the Guadalupe Trend and are not included in the Company\u2019s October 15, 2024, Mineral Resource Estimate (\u201cMRE\u201d). Expansion Drilling Highlights at Guadalupe The Company is reporting 4 core holes at Guadalupe East, located in the south-east end of the Guadalupe Trend with the following highlights: 42.07 grams per tonne (\u201cg/t\u201d) gold-equivalent (\u201cAuEq\u201d) (14.25 g/t Au and 2,150.0 g/t Ag) over 1.0 metres (\u201cm\u201d) estimated true width (\u201cETW\u201d) in hole 24GE-160, and: 11.33 g/t AuEq (3.34 g/t Au and 617.4 g/t Ag) over 1.3 m ETW, including: 21.28 g/t AuEq (6.27 g/t Au and 1,160.0 g/t Ag) over 0.7 m ETW; 5.32 g/t AuEq (1.80 g/t Au and 271.8 g/t Ag) over 2.4 m ETW in hole 24GE-162, including: 7.34 g/t AuEq (2.41 g/t Au and 381.0 g/t Ag) over 1.5 m ETW. Prime Mining Corp. Chief Executive Officer Scott Hicks commented, \u201cGuadalupe East continues to provide exceptional high-grade results. In targeting the sparsely drilled 700m gap between the main \u2018Laija\u2019 area at Guadulupe East and the Echeguren Shaft, we continue to find mineralization. Drill hole 24GE-160 is particularly outstanding for its high-grade gold and silver, measuring half an ounce of gold and over 2 kilograms of silver over a metre in length. Both drill holes 24GE-160 and 24GE-162 demonstrate the potential for further expansion of mineralized material, amenable for underground extraction.\u201d Scott Smith, Executive Vice President of Exploration, added, \u201cDrilling in the San Manuel vein area of Guadalupe East targeted a set of north-dipping veins in the footwall of the Estaca vein. Today\u2019s drill results demonstrate the high grades typical of Guadalupe East and are located over 400m away from the main Guadalupe East resource area. This part of the trend demonstrates strong exploration potential for further antithetic vein structures to be discovered with mineralization open in several directions. We believe the old mine workings, including the Echeguren Shaft, which is approximately 300m from these highlight holes, provide good hunting ground for further discovery, given the mineralization we have found to-date by referencing these workings for drill targeting.\u201d Story Continues Figure 1: Expansion drilling update Figure 1 Los Reyes Drill Program Progress_Dec 2024 Guadalupe East Drill Hole Highlights 1 Hole ID From (m) To (m) Interval (m) ETW (m) 2 Au (g/t) Ag (g/t) AuEq 3 Au Cut-off 4 24GE-160 173.80 175.20 1.40 1.05 0.41 11.80 0.56 0.2 24GE-160 184.70 186.15 1.45 1.10 0.60 55.10 1.31 0.2 24GE-160 265.50 267.15 1.65 1.25 3.34 617.36 11.33 0.2 including 266.30 267.15 0.85 0.65 6.27 1160.00 21.28 1 24GE-160 284.35 285.60 1.25 0.95 14.25 2150.00 42.07 1.0 24GE-162 85.85 87.00 1.15 0.80 0.81 0.80 0.82 0.2 24GE-162 195.30 196.60 1.30 0.90 0.26 4.60 0.32 0.2 24GE-162 211.80 215.10 3.30 2.35 1.80 271.80 5.32 0.2 including 213.00 215.10 2.10 1.50 2.41 381.00 7.34 1 Notes: A complete table of assay results from all deposits and all secondary zones intersected utilizing a 0.20 g/t Au cut-off is on the Company's website. Estimated True Widths (ETW) are estimated based on drill hole geology or comparisons with other on-section drill holes. Au Equivalent (AuEq) grade is calculated as Au g/t + (Ag g/t x ($25.24/$1950)) where $25.24 and $1950 are the price of one ounce of Ag and Au respectively (in US dollars). Composite assay grades presented in summary tables are calculated using a Au grade minimum average of 0.20 g/t or 1.0 g/t as indicated in \u201cAu Cut-off\u201d column of Summary Tables. Maximum internal waste included in any reported composite interval is 3.00 m. The 1.00 g/t Au cut-off is used to define higher-grade \u201ccores\u201d within the lower-grade halo. INTERPRETATION Guadalupe East: Three principal vein sets have been the focus of both historical mining operations and recent exploration at Guadalupe East (Estaca, San Manuel, and San Nicolas). In the Laija area, high-grade gold and silver mineralization is hosted in the steeply south-dipping Estaca vein and north-dipping antithetic veins emanating from its hanging wall. Further to the east, approaching the Echeguren Shaft area, high-grade mineralization is also hosted in the moderately north-dipping San Manuel and San Nicolas vein sets, which appear to truncate on the footwall of the Estaca vein. All three principal vein sets remain open in several directions and will continue to be the focus of exploration at Guadalupe East. The drillholes released today targeted the extension of the San Manuel vein set projected along-strike and down-dip from historical mine workings. The intercepts in 24GE-160 represent a 60m step out along strike to the west from 23GE-144 (8.17 g/t Au and 1,498 g/t Ag over 0.75m) and confirm the continuity of high-grade gold and silver mineralization hosted in the San Manuel area. The intercept in 24GE-160 similarly represents a 60m step out from stopes generated in the 2024 MRE. The Company, therefore, believes that both drillholes are likely to further expand underground mineable mineralization at Guadalupe East in future Resource estimates. Additionally, the drillholes released today are roughly 330m west of the Echeguren Shaft area, a historical mine exploited in the early 1900's for very high-grade silver. We believe that significant potential exists to expand mineralization along strike of the San Manuel vein set toward and beyond the Echeguren Shaft.

The drill program will continue to evaluate drilling plans using its success-based approach. This evaluation will also include prioritization of targets based on probability of resource development and generative area discovery potential. Five drill rigs are currently active on site at Los Reyes, with 2024 exploration focused on: Extending the high-grade Z-T Area shoots that remain open at depth, as well as along strike, both north and south. Expanding the known high-grade mineralization at Guadalupe East . Increasing the Central Area resource through additions at Noche Buena and its connection to San Miguel East. Generative target drilling of high-grade intercepts at Las Primas, Mariposa, Fresnillo and others to further develop the resource potential at Los Reyes.

Since acquiring Los Reyes in 2019, Prime has spent more than $59 million on direct exploration activities and has completed over 210,000 metres of drilling. On October 15, 2024, Prime announced an updated multi-million-ounce high-grade open pit constrained resource based on exploration drilling up to July 17, 2024 (see the October 15, 2024, press release for more information). October 15, 2024 Resource Statement (based on a $1950/oz gold price, $25.24/oz silver price, economic-constrained estimate) Oct 15 2024 Resource Table Refer to the Additional Notes section for the gold equivalent grade (\u201cAuEq\u201d) calculation method. Drilling is ongoing and suggests that the three known main resource trends (Guadalupe, Central and Z-T) are larger than previously reported. Potential also exists for new discoveries where mineralized trends have been identified outside of the currently defined resource areas. Historic operating results indicate that an estimated 1 million ounces of gold and 60 million ounces of silver were recovered from five separate operations at Los Reyes between 1770 and 1990. Prior to Prime\u2019s acquisition, recent operators of Los Reyes had spent approximately US$20 million on exploration, engineering, and prefeasibility studies. QA/QC Protocols and Sampling Procedures Drill core at the Los Reyes project is drilled in predominately HQ size (63.5 millimetres \u201cmm\u201d), reducing to NQ (47.6 mm) when required. Drill core samples are generally 1.50 m long along the core axis with allowance for shorter or longer intervals if required to suit geological constraints. After logging intervals are identified to be sampled, the core is cut and one half is submitted for assay. RC drilling returns rock chips and fines from a 133.35 mm diameter tricone bit. The returns are homogenized and split into 2 halves, with one half submitted for analysis and the other half stored. Sample QA/QC measures include unmarked certified reference materials, blanks, and field duplicates as well as preparation duplicates are inserted into the sample sequence and make up approximately 8% of the samples submitted to the laboratory for each drill hole. Samples are picked up from the Project by the laboratory personnel and transported to their facilities in Durango or Hermosillo Mexico, for sample preparation. Sample analysis is carried out by Bureau Veritas and ALS Labs, with fire assay, including over limits fire assay re-analysis, completed at their respective Hermosillo, Mexico laboratories and multi-element analysis completed in North Vancouver, Canada. Drill core sample preparation includes fine crushing of the sample to at least 70% passing less than 2 mm, sample splitting using a riffle splitter, and pulverizing a 250-gram split to at least 85% passing 75 microns. Gold in diamond drill core is analyzed by fire assay and atomic absorption spectroscopy of a 30 g sample (code FA430 or Au-AA23). Multi-element chemistry is analyzed by 4-Acid digestion of a 0.25-gram sample split (code MA300 or ME-ICP61) with detection by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer for a full suite of elements. Gold assay techniques FA430 and Au-AA23 have an upper detection limit of 10 ppm. Any sample that produces an over-limit gold value via the initial assay technique is sent for gravimetric finish via method FA-530 or Au-GRA21. Silver analyses by MA300 and ME-ICP61 have an upper limit of 200 ppm and 100 ppm, respectively. Samples with over-limit silver values are re-analyzed by fire assay with gravimetric finish FA530 or Au-GRA21. Both Bureau Veritas and ALS Labs are ISO/IEC accredited assay laboratories. Additional Notes Prime\u2019s MRE as of October 15, 2024 is classified in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (\u201c CIM \u201d) \u201cCIM Definition Standards - For Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves\u201d adopted by the CIM Council (as amended, the \u201c CIM Definition Standards \u201d) and in accordance with the requirements of NI 43-101. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. Metres is represented by \u201cm\u201d; \u201cETW\u201d is Estimated\u00a0True Width and is based on drill hole geometry or comparisons with other on-section drill holes; \u201cAu\u201d refers to gold, and \u201cAg\u201d refers to silver; \u201cg/t\u201d or \u201cgpt\u201d is grams per metric tonne; some figures may not sum due to rounding; Composite assay grades presented in summary tables are calculated using a Au grade minimum average of 0.20 g/t or 1.0 g/t as indicated in \u201cAu Cut-off\u201d column of Summary Tables. Maximum internal waste included in any reported composite interval is 3.00 m. The 1.00 g/t Au cut-off is used to define higher-grade \u201ccores\u201d within the lower-grade halo. Gold equivalent grades are calculated based on an assumed gold price of US$1,950 per ounce and silver price of $25.24 per ounce, based on the formula AuEq grade (g/t) = Au grade + (Ag grade x $25.24 / $1,950). Metallurgical recoveries are not considered in the in-situ grade estimate but are estimated to be 95.6% and 81% for gold and silver, respectively, when processed in a mill, and 73% and 25% respectively when heap-leached.

In October last year, someone asked on Reddit whether it's possible to retire doing a \"normal\" job and sought guidance on ways to achieve early retirement. The question received over 200 responses, but one answer stood out. In this comment, a Redditor said he retired at 35 in Southeast Asia and lives off dividend income from several funds. In a few other discussions, this investor said he is an Asian Australian who moved to Southeast Asia and lives off about $1,200 per month in income from the dividend funds he invested in. \"Worked my guts out in my 20s, retired on a paradise beach in Southeast Asia in my 30s,\" he commented during a discussion on Reddit. \"Honestly, it\u2019s the best life, feels like a dream,\" he said on another occasion.

186 Metres @ 8.8 g/t gold (Uncut) Traversing 8 High-Grade Veins in Down Dip Extension at Sunday Creek Mawson Gold Limited Mon, Dec 9, 2024, 2:30 PM 62 min read In This Article: MWSNF 0.00% Mawson Gold Limited (\"Mawson\" or the \"Company\") (TSXV:MAW)(Frankfurt:MXR)(OTC PINK:MWSNF) announces Southern Cross Gold Ltd. (\"Southern Cross Gold\" or \"SXG\") has released results from five drill holes from the Apollo prospect, with yet another significant discovery of 186 m @ 8.8 g/t Au * (\"gold\") (uncut) including 0.5 m @ 2,541.9 g/t Au at its 100%-owned Sunday Creek Gold-Antimony Project in Victoria. At Apollo, as for the adjacent Rising Sun mineralization, grades are increasing at depth. High Level Take Away: Sunday Creek Latest Results Setting New Records and Validating Growth Potential The latest drill results continue to reinforce Sunday Creek as one of the best gold-antimony discoveries in the world, with a globally leading drill hit rate (fifty greater than 100 g/t AuEq x m from152 holes for 67,623 m drilled). Discovery hole number SDDSC145 delivered exceptional gold grades, including: 2,541.9 g/t Au over 0.5 metres , representing the third-highest composite intercept in the project's history 4,880.0 g/t Au over 0.3 metres within this interval, being the highest-grade assay at Apollo and second highest across the entire project A broader mineralized zone of 8.8 g/t Au over 186 metres* (uncut), traversing 8 distinct high-grade vein sets These intersections rank among the most impressive gold intercepts reported globally in recent years and are typical of the geology in the region, where spectacular high-grade gold is found at depth. The systematic approach of testing the extensions of the deposit to depth has identified eight distinct mineralized vein-sets within SDDSC145. These vein-sets are like a \"Golden Ladder\" structure where the main host (100 m to 200 m wide) extends between the side rails deep into the earth, with multiple cross-cutting vein sets that host the gold forming rungs. These rungs are characterized by high-grade intercepts ranging from 20 g/t to over 7,330 g/t Au mineralization with at least 67 defined to date. Approximately 20% of Sunday Creek's in-situ recoverable value is from antimony. Sunday Creek is on track to become one of the most significant antimony projects in the Western world. China last week ratcheted up further supply pressure, imposing an outright ban on exports of antimony to the United States. This positions the project as one of the few significant future antimony sources in the Western worl d at a time when defence supply chains face mounting pressure sourcing antimony and other critical metals. Further drill results from the fourteen holes being processed at the laboratory will be soon released. SXG has one of the larger exploration drill programs globally with five rigs (moving to six shortly) drilling with 60,000 m planned by Q3 2025. Story Continues The combination of a globally significant discovery with exceptional gold grades and strategic antimony content, in a tier-one jurisdiction an hour by road from Melbourne, suggests that the next 12 months of SXG's systematic exploration and pre-developments plans will prove transformative. For Those Who Like the Details: SDDSC145 , drilled 186.0 m @ 9.6 g/t AuEq (8.8 g/t Au, 0.4% Sb ) * (uncut) which included nine intercepts of >50 g/t Au (up to 4,880.0 g/t Au over 0.3 m from 876.7 m) and eight intercepts of >5% Sb (up to 32.2% Sb) . Eight mineralized high-grade vein-sets were intersected with five being new discoveries outside the January 2024 exploration target area. Selected highlights including: 11.6 m @ 5.8 g/t AuEq (3.5 g/t Au, 1.3% Sb) from 708.6 m 8.0 m @ 11.9 g/t AuEq (10.6 g/t Au, 0.7% Sb) from 722.5 m, including: 0.5 m @ 133.2 g/t AuEq (131.2 g/t Au, 1.1% Sb) from 724.4 m 1.5 m @ 29.4 g/t AuEq (18.9 g/t Au, 5.6% Sb) from 753.2 m 0.9 m @ 45.9 g/t AuEq (44.1 g/t Au, 0.9% Sb) from 797.2 m 0.5 m @ 93.4 g/t AuEq (48.9 g/t Au, 23.6% Sb) from 828.8 m 2.3 m @ 19.2 g/t AuEq (19.2 g/t Au, 0.0% Sb) from 870.6 m 0.5 m @ 2,544.0 g/t AuEq (2,541.9 g/t Au, 1.1% Sb) from 876.4 m 4.8 m @ 21.8 g/t AuEq (14.7 g/t Au, 3.8% Sb) from 887.2 m, including 1.7 m @ 59.8 g/t AuEq (40.4 g/t Au, 10.3% Sb) from 890.3 m SDDSC143, drilled 155 m up-dip of SDDSC145 intercepted nine vein mineralized vein sets and included five intercepts of >20 g/t Au (up to 86.6 g/t Au)and twelve intercepts of >5% Sb (up to 34.9%) . Selected highlights include: 2.8 m @ 17.5 g/t AuEq (9.9 g/t Au, 4.1% Sb) from 525.0 m, including: 1.6 m @ 29.7 g/t AuEq (16.1 g/t Au, 7.2% Sb) from 525.6 m 3.1 m @ 8.8 g/t AuEq (4.9 g/t Au, 2.1% Sb) from 630.4 m, including: 1.6 m @ 14.6 g/t AuEq (7.3 g/t Au, 3.9% Sb) from 631.9 m Ongoing Exploration: Fourteen holes are currently being processed and analysed, with five holes in progress (Figure 1 and 2). Mawson owns 96,590,910 shares of SXG (48.7%), valuing its stake at A$313.9 million (C$315.3 million) based on SXG's closing price on December 6, 2024 AEDT. Michael Hudson, Mawson Interim CEO and Executive Chairman, states : \"Sunday Creek again proves truly remarkable as demonstrated by these outstanding results. The intersection of 4,880 g/t Au over 0.3 metres in SDDSC145 marks not only the highest grade ever intersected at Apollo, but also stands as our second-highest grade across the entire project. Importantly, these high-grade results demonstrate excellent vertical continuity, with SDDSC145 extending our known high-grade mineralization 76 m down-dip. \"These latest drill results represent a significant advancement in understanding the deposit's scale and grade potential. Five vein sets were new discoveries outside the January 2024 exploration target area, including the 0.5 m @2,541.9 g/t Au intersection. \"The results align with the characteristic pattern of Victorian epizonal deposits, where grades typically improve at depth. We are now seeing Apollo mirror these same characteristics (as did the adjacent mineralized body at Rising Sun), as we explore deeper vertically below 600 m. \"Our systematic drilling approach continues to yield compelling high-grade and continuous drill results. The combination of exceptional gold grades and significant antimony content distinguishes Sunday Creek globally, particularly given antimony's critical metal status and limited production outside China, accentuated by the current export restrictions and bans from China. \"With fourteen holes currently being processed and five rigs actively drilling, our exploration program maintains strong momentum. These results further strengthen our conviction that Sunday Creek has the potential to emerge as a globally significant gold-antimony discovery right here in Victoria, just an hour by road from Melbourne.\" Drill Hole Discussion Results from drill holes SDDSC133, SDDSC136, SDDSC139, SDDSC143 and SDDSC145 (Figures 1 and 2) at the Apollo prospect at the 100%-owned Sunday Creek Gold-Antimony Project in Victoria are described below (Figure 4). Drill hole SDDSC145 continues the systematic stepdown drilling program at Apollo, delivering exceptional results including a 0.5 m intersection grading 2,554 g/t AuEq. The hole achieved the highest-grade gold intersection ever recorded at Apollo and the second highest across the entire Sunday Creek Project, while also representing the fourth highest composite intercept to date. The hole was strategically drilled parallel to the mineralized corridor (but at a high angle to the mineralized vein sets), testing a prospective window of 310 m within the host position and averaged 186.0 m @ 9.6 g/t AuEq (8.8 g/t Au, 0.4% Sb ) * (uncut). A key achievement was extending the high-grade core of the A138 vein set in SDDSC145 0.5 m @ 2,544.0 g/t AuEq (2,541.9 g/t Au, 1.1% Sb) from 876.4 m, by 76 m down-dip below previously drilled SDDSC0128 0.3 m @ 43.4 g/t AuEq (28.6 g/t Au, 7.9% Sb) from 704.7 m, confirming strong vertical continuity of the mineralization (Figure 2). Significant mineralization was intersected throughout the hole from 708 m to 890 m depth, with the deepest sections (>870 m) yielding some of the most impressive grades. This pattern of increasing grade with depth aligns with typical characteristics of Victorian epizonal deposits. The drill hole intersected eight distinct mineralized vein-sets: Four represent down-dip extensions Four are infill intersections Nine intervals exceeded 50 g/t Au (with a high of 4,880.0 g/t Au) Eight intervals contained over 5% antimony (Sb), with values up to 32.2% Sb These multiple high-grade zones demonstrate the presence of a robust mineralising system that continues to improve with depth, supporting the ongoing systematic deeper drilling program at Apollo. At Apollo, as for the adjacent Rising Sun mineralization, grades are increasing at depth. Extended highlights include: 2.1 m @ 1.3 g/t AuEq (1.3 g/t Au, 0.0% Sb) from 548.8 m 11.6 m @ 5.8 g/t AuEq (3.5 g/t Au, 1.3% Sb) from 708.6 m, including: 1.6 m @ 9.8 g/t AuEq (6.5 g/t Au, 1.8% Sb) from 710.2 m 2.7 m @ 7.3 g/t AuEq (3.8 g/t Au, 1.9% Sb) from 713.0 m 1.8 m @ 11.7 g/t AuEq (6.4 g/t Au, 2.8% Sb) from 716.9 m 8.0 m @ 11.9 g/t AuEq (10.6 g/t Au, 0.7% Sb) from 722.5 m, including: 0.5 m @ 133.2 g/t AuEq (131.2 g/t Au, 1.1% Sb) from 724.4 m 2.2 m @ 6.5 g/t AuEq (4.2 g/t Au, 1.2% Sb) from 727.5 m 2.0 m @ 1.1 g/t AuEq (0.5 g/t Au, 0.3% Sb) from 733.4 m 1.5 m @ 29.4 g/t AuEq (18.9 g/t Au, 5.6% Sb) from 753.2 m, including: 0.7 m @ 62.9 g/t AuEq (39.8 g/t Au, 12.3% Sb) from 753.4 m 6.2 m @ 1.3 g/t AuEq (0.6 g/t Au, 0.4% Sb) from 758.8 m 5.4 m @ 2.0 g/t AuEq (1.2 g/t Au, 0.5% Sb) from 781.1 m, including: 1.2 m @ 5.5 g/t AuEq (2.3 g/t Au, 1.7% Sb) from 783.9 m 0.9 m @ 45.9 g/t AuEq (44.1 g/t Au, 0.9% Sb) from 797.2 m, including: 0.3 m @ 130.5 g/t AuEq (127.0 g/t Au, 1.9% Sb) from 797.2 m 1.4 m @ 5.2 g/t AuEq (4.2 g/t Au, 0.5% Sb) from 801.7 m, including: 0.4 m @ 15.5 g/t AuEq (13.1 g/t Au, 1.3% Sb) from 801.7 m 4.1 m @ 1.4 g/t AuEq (0.5 g/t Au, 0.5% Sb) from 805.6 m 1.3 m @ 8.0 g/t AuEq (3.6 g/t Au, 2.4% Sb) from 822.5 m 0.5 m @ 93.4 g/t AuEq (48.9 g/t Au, 23.6% Sb) from 828.8 m 1.8 m @ 4.4 g/t AuEq (2.6 g/t Au, 0.9% Sb) from 837.3 m, including: 1.5 m @ 4.6 g/t AuEq (2.7 g/t Au, 1.0% Sb) from 837.3 m 2.3 m @ 19.2 g/t AuEq (19.2 g/t Au, 0.0% Sb) from 870.6 m, including: 0.5 m @ 85.3 g/t AuEq (85.2 g/t Au, 0.1% Sb) from 872.3 m 0.5 m @ 2,544.0 g/t AuEq (2,541.9 g/t Au, 1.1% Sb) from 876.4 m 4.8 m @ 21.8 g/t AuEq (14.7 g/t Au, 3.8% Sb) from 887.2 m, including: 1.7 m @ 59.8 g/t AuEq (40.4 g/t Au, 10.3% Sb) from 890.3 m Drill hole SDDSC143 , positioned 155 m up-dip from SDDSC145, successfully tested a 224 m prospective corridor, delivering strong infill results across nine mineralized vein sets. The hole extended three high-grade vein sets by 20 m to 40 m while returning five intercepts greater than 20 g/t Au (with values up to 86.6 g/t Au) and twelve intercepts exceeding 5% Sb (reaching up to 34.9% Sb) . This infill hole has effectively enhanced the understanding of the mineralization between previously drilled sections. Extended highlights include: 1.5 m @ 8.0 g/t AuEq (3.9 g/t Au, 2.2% Sb) from 449.7 m 1.6 m @ 2.1 g/t AuEq (1.5 g/t Au, 0.4% Sb) from 459.9 m 1.9 m @ 1.6 g/t AuEq (0.5 g/t Au, 0.6% Sb) from 496.9 m 2.1 m @ 5.3 g/t AuEq (4.5 g/t Au, 0.4% Sb) from 508.1 m, including: 0.5 m @ 21.4 g/t AuEq (20.2 g/t Au, 0.7% Sb) from 509.8 m 2.8 m @ 17.5 g/t AuEq (9.9 g/t Au, 4.1% Sb) from 525.0 m, including: 1.6 m @ 29.7 g/t AuEq (16.1 g/t Au, 7.2% Sb) from 525.6 m 4.9 m @ 1.5 g/t AuEq (1.1 g/t Au, 0.2% Sb) from 537.7 m 1.3 m @ 5.1 g/t AuEq (3.7 g/t Au, 0.8% Sb) from 545.3 m 5.4 m @ 1.8 g/t AuEq (1.0 g/t Au, 0.4% Sb) from 553.3 m 3.7 m @ 1.0 g/t AuEq (0.8 g/t Au, 0.1% Sb) from 602.4 m 2.5 m @ 6.4 g/t AuEq (2.0 g/t Au, 2.3% Sb) from 611.9 m, including: 0.4 m @ 34.3 g/t AuEq (7.2 g/t Au, 14.4% Sb) from 612.4 m 3.1 m @ 8.8 g/t AuEq (4.9 g/t Au, 2.1% Sb) from 630.4 m, including: 1.6 m @ 14.6 g/t AuEq (7.3 g/t Au, 3.9% Sb) from 631.9 m 0.9 m @ 21.9 g/t AuEq (12.1 g/t Au, 5.2% Sb) from 640.8 m, including: 0.6 m @ 34.0 g/t AuEq (18.5 g/t Au, 8.2% Sb) from 641.2 m 0.8 m @ 3.5 g/t AuEq (0.8 g/t Au, 1.5% Sb) from 649.9 m Drill hole SDDSC139 , originally designed to extend vein sets at Apollo East, deviated from its planned trajectory and was unsuccessful at intersecting the original target position. While the hole intersected four mineralized zones, only one achieved significant grades - the A130 vein set, which returned 1.1 m @ 19.2 g/t AuEq. The hole included three intercepts of >10 g/t Au (up to 77.5 g/t Au) and three intercepts of >5% Sb (up to 7.36% Sb) . Extended highlights include: 0.7 m @ 3.6 g/t AuEq (0.8 g/t Au, 1.5% Sb) from 367.5 m 0.9 m @ 5.5 g/t AuEq (1.6 g/t Au, 2.1% Sb) from 395.1 m 0.2 m @ 13.1 g/t AuEq (3.7 g/t Au, 5.0% Sb) from 401.2 m 1.1 m @ 19.2 g/t AuEq (16.4 g/t Au, 1.5% Sb) from 436.3 m, including: 0.9 m @ 21.2 g/t AuEq (18.4 g/t Au, 1.5% Sb) from 436.3 m SDDSC133 and SDDSC136 were designed as control holes at Apollo East, with the intention to locate the dyke position. Both holes drilled N-S striking faults at the expected dyke location and hence did not intercept the dyke body. SDDSC133 intercepted the Goliath Fault, and SDDSC136 intercepted the Gatekeeper Fault. Highlight from SDDSC136: 1.6 m @ 2.6 g/t AuEq (2.6 g/t Au, 0.0% Sb) from 147.0 m Pending Results and Update Fourteen holes (SDDSC120W1, 129, 140, 142, 144, 146, 146W1, 147-151, 153, 155) are currently being processed and analyzed, with five holes (SDDSC149W1, 152, 154, 155A, 157) in progress (Figures 1 and 2). Further Information No upper gold grade cut is applied in the averaging and intervals are reported as drill thickness. However, during future Mineral Resource studies, the requirement for assay top cutting will be assessed. The Company notes that due to rounding of assay results to one significant figure, minor variations in calculated composite grades may occur. Figures 1 to 4 show project location, plan and longitudinal views of drill results reported here and Tables 2 to 4 provide collar and assay data. The true thickness of the mineralized intervals reported individually as estimated true widths (\"ETW\"), otherwise they are interpreted to be approximately 25% to 50% of the sampled thickness for other reported holes. Lower grades were cut at 1.0 g/t AuEq lower cutoff over a maximum width of 2 m with higher grades cut at 5.0 g/t AuEq lower cutoff over a maximum of 1 m width unless specified unless otherwise* specified to demonstrate higher grade assays. About Sunday Creek The Sunday Creek epizonal-style gold project is located 60 km north of Melbourne within 16,900 hectares (\"Ha\") of granted exploration tenements. SXG is also the freehold landholder of 133.29 Ha that form the key portion in and around the main drilled area at the Sunday Creek Project and is closing on a 921.22 Ha (total 1,054.51 Ha or 2,605.8 acres) subject to Foreign Investment Board (\"FIRB\") approval. Gold and antimony form in a relay of vein sets that cut across a steeply dipping zone of intensely altered rocks (the \"host\"). When observed from above, the host resembles the side rails of a ladder, where the sub-vertical mineralized vein sets are the rungs that extend from surface to depth. At Apollo and Rising Sun these individual \u2018rungs' have been defined over 600 m depth extent from surface to 1,100 m below surface, are 2.5 m to 3.5 m wide (median widths) (and up to 10 m), and 20 m to 100 m in strike. Cumulatively, 152 drill holes for 67,623.19 m have been reported by SXG (and Mawson Gold Ltd) from Sunday Creek since late 2020. An additional 12 holes for 582.55 m from Sunday Creek were abandoned due to deviation or hole conditions. Fourteen drillholes for 2,383 m have been reported regionally outside of the main Sunday Creek drill area. A total of 64 historic drill holes for 5,599 m were completed from the late 1960s to 2008. The project now contains a total of fifty (50) >100 g/t AuEq x m and fifty-eight (58) >50 to 100 g/t AuEq x m drill holes by applying a 2 m @ 1 g/t lower cut. Our systematic drill program is strategically targeting these significant vein formations, initially these have been defined over 1,350 m strike of the host from Christina to Apollo prospects, of which approximately 620 m has been more intensively drill tested (Rising Sun to Apollo). At least 67 \u2018rungs' have been defined to date, defined by high-grade intercepts (20 g/t to >7,330 g/t Au) along with lower grade edges. Ongoing step-out drilling is aiming to uncover the potential extent of this mineralized system (Figure 3). Geologically, the project is located within the Melbourne Structural Zone in the Lachlan Fold Belt. The regional host to the Sunday Creek mineralization is an interbedded turbidite sequence of siltstones and minor sandstones metamorphosed to sub-greenschist facies and folded into a set of open north-west trending fold. Exploration Target On January 23, 2024, SXG announced the maiden gold and antimony Exploration Target at its flagship 100%-owned Sunday Creek Project in Victoria, Australia. The Exploration Target ranges reported are shown in Table 1. Notably, the Exploration Target was constrained to the current drill footprint at Apollo (in shallower areas broadly above holes report here) and Rising Sun, as at the time these areas only contained sufficient drilling to determine continuity and infer grade ranges. Significant potential exists to increase the size of the exploration target with high grade drill results now drilled for up to 650 m beyond the Exploration Target area. Table 1.

The grade range given in the exploration target is determined with consideration to the drill results within the modeled exploration target area and consideration of the geological setting in an established mining camp. The potential tonnages and grades are conceptual in nature and are based on previous drill results that defined the approximate length, thickness, depth and grade of the portion of the historic mineral resource estimate. There has been insufficient exploration to define a current mineral resource and the Company cautions that there is a risk further exploration will not result in the delineation of a current mineral resource. The gold equivalent calculation applied for exploration target was \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc5e = \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc62 (\ud835\udc54/\ud835\udc61) + 1.58 \u00d7 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc4f (%), whereas today the Company is applying \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc5e = \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc62 (\ud835\udc54/\ud835\udc61) + 1.88 \u00d7 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc4f (%) (see below for further description). Further Information Further discussion and analysis of the Sunday Creek project by Southern Cross Gold is available on the SXG website at www.southerncrossgold.com.au . Critical Metal Epizonal Gold-Antimony Deposits Sunday Creek (Figure 4) is an epizonal gold-antimony deposit formed in the late Devonian (like Fosterville, Costerfield and Redcastle), 60 million years later than mesozonal gold systems formed in Victoria (for example Ballarat and Bendigo). Epizonal deposits are a form of orogenic gold deposit classified according to their depth of formation: epizonal (<6 km), mesozonal (6-12 km) and hypozonal (>12 km). Epizonal deposits in Victoria often have associated high levels of the critical metal, antimony, and Sunday Creek is no exception. China claims a 56 per cent share of global mined supplies of antimony, according to a 2023 European Union study. Antimony features highly on the critical minerals lists of many countries including Australia, the United States of America, Canada, Japan and the European Union. Australia ranks seventh for antimony production despite all production coming from a single mine at Costerfield in Victoria, located nearby to all SXG projects. Antimony alloys with lead and tin which results in improved properties for solders, munitions, bearings and batteries. Antimony is a prominent additive for halogen-containing flame retardants. Adequate supplies of antimony are critical to the world's energy transition, and to the high-tech industry, especially the semi-conductor and defence sectors where it is a critical additive to primers in munitions. The Chinese government placed export limits on September 15, 2024 on six antimony-related products. Additionally, the new policy bans gold-antimony smelting separation technology exports without permission from the ministry. This week China further ratcheted up supply pressure, imposing an outright ban on exports of gallium, germanium and antimony to the United States. This puts pressure on Western defence supply chains and negatively affect the supply of the metal and push up pricing given China's dominance of the supply of the metal in the global markets. This is positive for SXG as we are likely to have one of the very few large and high-quality projects of antimony in the western world that can feed western demand into the future. Antimony represents approximately 20% in situ recoverable value of Sunday Creek at an AuEq of 1.88. Technical Background and Qualified Person The Qualified Person, Michael Hudson, Executive Chairman and a director of Mawson Gold, and a Fellow of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, has reviewed, verified and approved the technical contents of this release. Analytical samples are transported to the Bendigo facility of On Site Laboratory Services (\"On Site\") which operates under both an ISO 9001 and NATA quality systems. Samples were prepared and analyzed for gold using the fire assay technique (PE01S method; 25 gram charge), followed by measuring the gold in solution with flame AAS equipment. Samples for multi-element analysis (BM011 and over-range methods as required) use aqua regia digestion and ICP-MS analysis. The QA/QC program of Southern Cross Gold consists of the systematic insertion of certified standards of known gold content, blanks within interpreted mineralized rock and quarter core duplicates. In addition, On Site inserts blanks and standards into the analytical process. MAW considers that both gold and antimony that are included in the gold equivalent calculation (\"AuEq\") have reasonable potential to be recovered at Sunday Creek, given current geochemical understanding, historic production statistics and geologically analogous mining operations. Historically, ore from Sunday Creek was treated onsite or shipped to the Costerfield mine, located 54 km to the northwest of the project, for processing during WW1. The Costerfield mine corridor, now owned by Mandalay Resources Ltd contains two million ounces of equivalent gold (Mandalay Q3 2021 Results), and in 2020 was the sixth highest-grade global underground mine and a top 5 global producer of antimony. MAW considers that it is appropriate to adopt the same gold equivalent variables as Mandalay Resources Ltd in its Mandalay Technical Report, 2024 dated March 28, 2024. The gold equivalence formula used by Mandalay Resources was calculated using Costerfield's 2023 production costs, using a gold price of US$1,900 per ounce, an antimony price of US$12,000 per tonne and 2023 total year metal recoveries of 94% for gold and 89% for antimony, and is as follows: \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc5e = \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc62 (\ud835\udc54/\ud835\udc61) + 1.88 \u00d7 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc4f (%). Based on the latest Costerfield calculation and given the similar geological styles and historic toll treatment of Sunday Creek mineralization at Costerfield, SXG considers that a \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc5e = \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc62 (\ud835\udc54/\ud835\udc61) + 1.88 \u00d7 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc4f (%) is appropriate to use for the initial exploration targeting of gold-antimony mineralization at Sunday Creek.

income-oriented investors should have diversified portfolios. You may be well aware that during the Federal Reserve\u2019s cycle of interest-rate increases \u2014 even banks suffered as the market values of their bondholdings declined. Yes, long-term investors realize interest rates will rise and fall, but diversifying across asset classes is a good way to ride through those cycles and maybe even set yourself up for capital growth as you get paid. The Eaton Vance Enhanced Equity Income Fund II EOS is a closed-end fund rated five stars (the highest rating) within Morningstar\u2019s \u201cU.S. Fund Derivative Income\u201d category. The fund pays a monthly distribution. Its annualized distribution rate, based on its most recent monthly payout of 15.23 cents a share (since April) and Wednesday\u2019s closing share price of $23.68, was 7.72%. Eaton Vance is based in Boston and is a subsidiary of Morgan Stanley. Most Read from MarketWatch I was laid off. I\u2019m 43 and my husband is 35.

But on a total return basis, with distributions reinvested and after annual expenses totaling 1.09% of average assets under management, EOS has returned 94.5% over the past five years through Wednesday, which isn\u2019t far behind the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust\u2019s SPY five-year return of 98.3%. For 10 years, EOS has returned 254.2%, ahead of SPY\u2019s return of 238.5%. SPY has low expenses. If we look at the S&P 500 itself, with no expenses, the 10-year return has been 241.7%, which is still well below the EOS return for that period. During an interview with MarketWatch, Douglas Rogers, the fund\u2019s portfolio manager, described its strategy and the nuances of its closed-end structure. Bob Hoffman, an alternatives trader at Morgan Stanley, explained how the fund trades options to generate capital gains that are distributed to shareholders. Rogers has been with Eaton Vance since 2001. He said the fund\u2019s monthly payout had changed periodically but had only increased since he took over as portfolio manager in 2021. Story continues The case for a diverse income portfolio When interest rates rise, bond prices decline automatically, so that the market yield on older bonds will match those of newly issued bonds of the same maturity and credit quality. The opposite happens when interest rates decline. Then again, short-term and long-term rates don\u2019t always move in tandem. The Federal Open Market Committee made another 25-basis-point cut to the federal-funds rate on Wednesday, to a target range of 4.25% to 4.50%. But bond prices (and stock prices) declined Wednesday . That day the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes increased to 4.52% from 4.41% the previous day. Two weeks earlier 10-year notes were yielding 4.18%. The point is that you cannot predict the direction of interest rates or bond prices. Even though the broad theme is that the Fed began a cycle of interest-rate cuts in September, the Federal Reserve is going through a cycle of rate cuts, the federal-funds rate is an overnight rate. The bond market determines the direction of long-term rates, with the Fed having influence depending on how it manages its own portfolio of long-term bonds. A patient investor holding bonds or shares of a bond fund can ride out interest-rate cycles to avoid selling at a loss. But income-oriented investors might also rest easier if they are diversified by asset class, which means adding exposure to income-oriented equity funds. Increasing income in the stock market Some stock funds are focused on companies that pay high quarterly dividends, which in turn can be distributed to the funds\u2019 shareholders. Another way to enhance income in the stock market is to write or trade options. A call option is a contract that allows an investor to buy a security at a particular price (called the strike price) until the option expires. A put option is the opposite, allowing the purchaser to sell a security at a specified price until the option expires. A covered call option is one an investor can write when they already own a security. The strike price is \u201cout of the money,\u201d which means it is higher than the stock\u2019s current price. If you write a covered call option, you receive a premium. If the stock moves above the strike price before the option expires, it will be exercised. You will be forced to sell at the strike price. So you will have gotten that gain while keeping the option premium. But you will also have lost any upside beyond the strike price. If the option were to expire without the stock hitting the strike price, you would continue to hold the shares and would be free to write another option. Funds that make use of covered call options take varying approaches. For example, Kevin Simpson of Capital Wealth Planning, who co-manages the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF DIVO explained in 2022 that his strategy was to write covered calls on a small number of the fund\u2019s holdings. (DIVO also has a five-star rating from Morningstar and it currently quotes a distribution rate of 4.80%.) Another approach is to use equity-linked notes for broad covered-call exposure. This strategy is followed by the JPMorgan Premium Income Equity ETF JEPQ and the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF JEPI. (JEPQ was established in 2022, so has no Morningstar rating. JEPI has a four-star rating from Morningstar.) Hoffman explained that for EOS, \u201cwe write basically on almost all the individual names [held by the fund], assuming we can and that they have listed options,\u201d which means the options will be easy to sell. He went on to say that the fund\u2019s strategy is to trade out-of-call-option positions (hopefully for profits) before the underlying stock hits the strike prices. \u201cMy goal is to let Doug select when to enter and exit individual stock positions,\u201d Hoffman said. Stock selection Some stock funds that make use of covered calls hold stocks with relatively high dividend yields in keeping with the main objective of providing income. That could be considered to be a value-oriented strategy. But the Eaton Vance Enhanced Equity Income Fund II takes a growth-oriented approach, with Rogers selecting from among the roughly 400 stocks in the Russell 1000 Growth Index RLG. EOS currently holds 47 stocks. These were the top 10 holdings as of Oct. 31, with comparisons of allocations to these stocks in the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF IWF and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY as of Dec. 18.

Rogers said that he works with Eaton Vance\u2019s team of analysts to select \u201ccompanies that can grow year in and year out in most market conditions.\u201d He stressed the need for \u201cstable and consistent growth,\u201d with strong executive leadership and \u201ca well-defined and loyal customer base and a large addressable market.\u201d He said he typically holds stocks for an average of three years. One holding he discussed was Copart Inc. CPRT, which auctions cars it acquires from insurance companies, after the insurers decide damaged vehicles have been totaled \u2014 meaning the cost to repair would be more than the cars\u2019 local market values. Copart has an advantage in this specialized business, Rogers said, because of the \u201cmassive barriers to entry.\u201d \u201cThey own a lot of real estate in strategic areas,\u201d which is important because over time it becomes more difficult to place a large vehicle yard in areas where gaining local government approval would be difficult, he said. Copart\u2019s global network allows it to sell acquired vehicles in various countries, if particular problems, such as certain sensors or other safety equipment failures, have caused domestic insurers to consider the cars \u201ctotaled.\u201d \u201cThey are insurers\u2019 first choice because the breadth of their network to sell totaled vehicles is wider than any competitor,\u201d Rogers said. The closed-end structure, payouts and tax treatment A traditional open-ended mutual fund has shares that can only be bought and sold at the market close each day. The share price is called the net asset value, and is simply the value of all the fund\u2019s holdings at the close divided by the share price. An open-ended mutual fund\u2019s shares are purchased from the fund provider, and sold back to the provider. So the number of shares can change every day. The fund manager has to invest money that flows in, and if there is a high level of redemptions, the manager may have to sell investment positions. These aspects can make it difficult to manage this type of portfolio, especially during periods of market turmoil. The broad U.S. stock market has always recovered after corrections or crashes, but in the heat of the moment, mutual-fund redemptions cause a spiraling effect as more securities are sold. A closed-end fund has a set number of shares that are publicly traded. Investors can move in or out of positions at any time, but no new money is flowing into the fund unless the fund company goes through a formal process to issue new shares. A closed-end fund has an NAV calculated each day at the close, but its share price might be at a discount or a premium to the NAV. Wednesday\u2019s closing share price of $23.68 for the Eaton Vance Enhanced Equity Income Fund II was slightly above its NAV of $23.42. One reason that a closed-end fund can keep its distributions steady is that the monthly payments to investors can include returns of capital. Rogers said that option premiums had made up about two-thirds of recent monthly distributions to EOS shareholders, with returns of capital making up most of the rest because the growth stocks held by the funds tend to pay small dividends or no dividends. The return of capital means investors\u2019 own money is being sent back as part of the distribution. This practice may be mystifying at first, but there is a good reason for it. The strong performance of the fund\u2019s growth-stock holdings means the fund is sitting on unrealized capital gains. Instead of selling some of those positions and booking taxable gains, the fund can return some of the investors\u2019 capital as part of the distribution to lower investors\u2019 current taxable income. The return of capital boosts current income without forcing the fund manager to book gains on the sale of stock. The increase in the valuation of the fund\u2019s holdings provides \u201ccover\u201d for the capital return \u2014 in other words, the return on capital hasn\u2019t been lowering the fund\u2019s total assets or cutting into the share price significantly. The effect of the capital return is to lower the investor\u2019s cost basis. The taxable (estimated) two-thirds of the distribution is mainly capital gains, which may be taxed at a lower rate than regular income for some investors. The return on capital isn\u2019t taxed, but a lower cost basis means a larger taxable gain down the line when the investor eventually sells EOS shares. So the return of capital defers taxes, which is an advantage for the investor. Returns of capital aren\u2019t limited to closed-end funds. For example, the Global-X Nasdaq-100 Covered Call ETF QYLD pays monthly and in a Form 19a tax filing reported that nearly all of its distributions in 2024 through Nov. 25 had been returns of capital. That alone doesn\u2019t tell us very much. But if we exclude distributions, this fund\u2019s share price declined 23% over the 10-year period through Wednesday, while the EOS share price had increased 69%, according to FactSet. QYLD\u2019s 10-year total return with distributions reinvested and net of expenses was 125.3% through Wednesday, compared with the aforementioned return of 254.2% for EOS. EOS was established in January 2005. It is part of a group of seven closed-end U.S. equity funds managed by Eaton Vance. Keep in mind that with its focus on growth stocks, this fund can be quite volatile during weak periods for technology stocks. In 2022, when the S&P 500 fell 18.2% and the Nasdaq-100 Index fell 32.6%, EOS declined 26.5% (all with dividends or distributions reinvested). EOS is suitable for investors who need current income but also want to pursue capital growth while having the discipline not to sell into a declining stock market.

Wed, Dec 11, 2024, 2:00 PM 7 min read In This Article: SRCRF +1.45% Highlights Hole 24MN-009 returned: 1.69 grams per metric tonne (\"g/t\") gold (\"Au\") over 55.7 metres (\"m\"). Wide high-grade intercept demonstrates open-pit potential of the Goldwedge Underground, further confirming larger open-pit potential for Manhattan District The Goldwedge Underground Stope Trend is open at depth and along strike. Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - December 11, 2024) - Scorpio Gold Corp. (TSXV: SGN) (OTCQB: SRCRF) (FSE: RY9) (\" Scorpio Gold \", or the \" Company \") is pleased to announce further results from its 2024 drilling campaign at the Manhattan District Project (\" Manhattan \"), Nevada, USA. Under Scorpio's new management, the 2024 drilling campaign had two goals: (1) drilling to support an open-pit focused, maiden mineral resource estimate, and (2) drilling to test expansion potential of the Goldwedge Underground Stope Trend (\" Goldwedge Trend \") and the Reliance Fault to the northwest of the historic Manhattan open pits. Hole 24MN-009 tested the Goldwedge Trend successfully, extending mineralization and adding to the results announced on October 24, 2024 ( Figure 1 ). Scorpio Gold's Vice President of Exploration, Harrison Pokrandt, commented, \" Hole 24MN-009 undercuts the underground workings and previous drilling along the Goldwedge Trend. The 1.69 g/t over 55.7 metres interval further strengthens our belief that the Goldwedge Trend has open pit potential at Manhattan. Results from the 2024 drilling campaign are strengthening our belief in Manhattan's potential as a multi-million-ounce gold resource in Nevada. \" Scorpio Gold's CEO, Zayn Kalyan, remarked, \" 2024 has been a transformative year for Scorpio Gold. With new management and a re-set share structure we refocused the company on Manhattan's potential to host a large open-pit gold deposit. Today's result is a large step forward, with a wide, high-grade intercept on the Goldwedge Trend that is open for expansion. We have more drilling results expected in early 2025, ahead of Manhattan's maiden mineral resource estimate. We are using these results to guide a larger expansion drilling program in 2025.\" Figure 1: Plan view of Manhattan District gold mineralization.

The hole features notable mineralization related to the Goldwedge Trend within a drilled depth of 118.9 m to 174.7 m, including 2.53 g/t Au over 8.7 m and 4.71 g/t Au over 8.8 m (see Table 1) . This interval expands the strong mineralization noted in historic surface and underground drill holes at the Goldwedge Mine (see Figure 2 ). The mineralization is hosted within strongly silicified and sericite-chlorite altered argillite and limestone units with brecciated quartz-adularia-calcite veins. The zone is strongly deformed (see Figure 3 ) with multiple brittle fault zones.

Adjacent to Goldwedge is the ~4,780-hectare Manhattan Project, centered on two past-producing pits, acquired from Kinross in 2021. The consolidated Manhattan District presents an exciting late-stage exploration opportunity, with over 100,000 meters of historical drilling, with significant resource potential, alongside valuable permitting. Scorpio Gold also holds a 100% interest in the Mineral Ridge gold project located in Esmeralda County, Nevada. Scorpio Gold produced over 222,440 oz of gold at Mineral Ridge between 2010 and 2020. With a proven and probable resource, valuable permits, water rights, infrastructure, and the recently acquired adjacent North Star exploration target, Mineral Ridge has significant near-term development potential.
