[{"text": "Herbalife Ltd. (HLF): Why Is Seth Klarman Bullish On This Cheap Value Stock Now? Neha Gupta Sat, Jan 18, 2025, 9:54 PM 6 min read In This Article: HLF -1.51% We recently compiled a list of the 10 Cheap Value Stocks to Invest In, According To Seth Klarman . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) stands against the other cheap value stocks. No value in crypto, but the focus should be on artificial intelligence. That\u2019s the stance held by value investing magnet Seth Klarman. Like most conservative investors, the billionaire investor employs a value approach, looking for stocks and other assets that are trading below their intrinsic value and purchasing them at a discount. The value investment strategy has been the catalyst behind Baupost Group , generating average returns of 20% over the last decade. The impressive run also stems from an aggressive investment strategy that tries to profit from emerging trends. That\u2019s evident by Klarman's moves around artificial intelligence in the hedge fund portfolio. It\u2019s no secret that Klarman has reiterated his admiration for artificial intelligence. Nevertheless, he insists that he is approaching the technology \u201cwith open eyes, with great humility, with a sense that profound change is upon us,\u201d That\u2019s evident given that Baupost Group does not hold significant stakes in some of the biggest plays around revolutionary technology.

While optimistic about AI, the Baupost Group CEO has clarified that he does not believe the burgeoning AI industry should be left to its own devices. Instead, he is one of the advocates calling on regulators and CEOs not to let \"this get out of control.\"\u00a0 If unchecked, the billionaire investor believes the technology could result in mass unemployment and, in the worst case scenario, \"will sink the economy,\" While Klarman is bullish about artificial intelligence opportunities, he has touted opportunities in the credit and real estate sector. The Baupost Group CEO and portfolio manager insist opportunities are cropping up as interest rates decrease, resulting in improved consumer purchasing power. \"Real estate, in general, has been fruitful, not only in buying buildings but also indebted real estate-related companies, especially in Europe and Asia,\" he said. Even as Klarman remains bullish about the overall equity market outlook, he has not engaged in a buying spree as a value investor. Part of the cautious approach involves valuations in the equity markets getting out of hand. Most stocks are trading at premium valuations, with major indices near all-time highs. Story Continues In addition to valuation concerns, he has warned of increased government meddling in the markets more than ever. The billionaire investor has raised concerns about increased government intervention, making it difficult to tap into value investments in the market. \"It's almost like we've sort of outlawed failure \u2014 or at least financial failure,\" he said. \"That leads to a buildup of moral hazard. If nobody thinks anything can go wrong, they'll take crazy risks because they'll get bailed out.\" Nevertheless, Baupost Group's investment portfolio is still rife with cheap value stocks to invest in.\u00a0 The adjustments that have come into play in recent quarters have affirmed the focus on investment plays trading below their intrinsic values. Recently, he has reduced his holdings in stocks with premium valuations and shifted his focus to lesser-known investments. His focus has been stocks trading at highly discounted valuations characterized by low price-to-earnings multiple.

Prior to joining the firm, Steven was Chairman of Crescent Management and a consulting security analyst for Kaplan, Nathan & Co. Steven earned a Bachelors degree in Education from Northwestern University.The FPA Crescent Fund's portfolio consists of both long and short equity positions. The fund seeks value in all parts of a company's capital structure, including common and preferred stocks, as well as corporate and convertible bonds. FPA Crescent invests in securities \"that the consensus does not wish to own,\" searching for stocks and convertible bonds that reflect low cyclically-adjusted price-earnings ratios and trade at discounts to private market value. Corporate bonds with yields substantially higher than those of government securities are also considered. The FPA Crescent Fund's investing process stems from several pillars. Absolute value investors: The fund seeks genuine bargains rather than relatively attractive securities. Alignment of interests: The fund invests its money alongside its clients, and act as stewards of its shared capital. Broad mandate: The fund invests across the capital structure, asset classes, market caps, industries and geographies. The fund is also willing to hold cash. Long-term focus: The fund believes the best way to accomplish its goals is to accept short-term underperformance in exchange for long-term success. Warning!

(HLF) the Best Single Digit Stock to Buy Now? Ashar Jawad Thu, Jan 9, 2025, 10:43 PM 6 min read In This Article: HLF -1.51% We recently published a list of 10 Best Single Digit Stocks To Buy Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) stands against other best single digit stocks to buy now. The US markets had a blockbuster 2024, led by a strong show by the technology sector. The broader market grew by over 23% during the year after rising 24% in 2023. Two consecutive years of over 20% gains marked the market\u2019s best performance in nearly three decades. READ ALSO: 12 Best Long-Term Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds and 10 Best Penny Stocks to Buy for 2025 . Stocks have benefited from a resilient American economy that steered clear of recession. Waning inflation and interest rate cuts also bolstered investor sentiment throughout last year. Research analysts anticipate continued growth in 2025 amid strong economic data and anticipation of a business-friendly Trump administration. In a note on December 30, Wedbush Securities analyst, Dan Ives, said that he expects tech stocks to surge 25% this year with the incoming Trump administration focusing on slashing unnecessary regulations. Todd Rosenbluth, the head of research at VettaFi, believes 2025 could be the year for small-cap stocks with solid underlying fundamentals. He expects ETFs specializing in small-caps to make gains as investors broaden their market exposure as interest rates ease. Rosenbluth shared the following remarks while talking to CNBC in late November. \u201cSmall caps are going to become more in favor in 2025. They started to perk up since the election and heading into the election as interest rates have been coming down.\u201d Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee also shares similar sentiments. In an interview in November, he said that small-cap stocks could soar in the coming years under the new administration, driving monster returns. \u201cI do think there\u2019s still a lot of upside. So I think small-caps could, over the next couple of years, outperform by more than 100%.\u201d On the other hand, some Wall Street analysts are cautious about the new year and have warned of potential downsides, with the incoming administration promising new tariffs. Following his election victory, President-elect Trump vowed to impose steep tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, which could increase costs for manufacturers.

High Liner Foods Simply Wall St Dividend Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Overview: High Liner Foods Incorporated processes and markets frozen seafood products in North America with a market cap of CA$476.18 million. Operations: High Liner Foods generates revenue of $961.30 million from the manufacturing and marketing of prepared and packaged frozen seafood products in North America. Dividend Yield: 4.3% High Liner Foods' dividend payments are well-covered by both earnings and cash flows, with payout ratios of 24.3% and 12.3%, respectively, suggesting sustainability. However, the company's dividend history has been volatile and unreliable over the past decade, indicating potential risk for income-focused investors. Despite trading at a discount to its estimated fair value, High Liner's high debt level poses financial concerns that may impact future dividend stability or growth prospects in the Canadian market. Take a closer look at High Liner Foods' potential here in our dividend report. Our comprehensive valuation report raises the possibility that High Liner Foods is priced lower than what may be justified by its financials.

Story Continues Dividend Yield: 7.6% Peyto Exploration & Development offers a high dividend yield of 7.6%, placing it among the top Canadian dividend payers, but its sustainability is questionable. The payout ratio of 88.2% suggests coverage by earnings; however, dividends are not well-supported by free cash flows with a cash payout ratio of 124.7%. Historical volatility in payments over the past decade and recent insider selling further highlight potential risks for dividend stability despite trading below estimated fair value. Click here to discover the nuances of Peyto Exploration & Development with our detailed analytical dividend report.

Trading below estimated fair value enhances its appeal, though declining earnings forecasts may pose future challenges for growth stability.

Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar . The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s fiscal first-quarter earnings has moved down 5.1% to 30 cents in the past 30 days.

Factors Shaping Walgreens\u2019 Q1 Performance U.S. Retail Pharmacy For the past several months, the company\u2019s U.S. retail business has struggled with a difficult consumer environment due to ongoing inflation and discretionary purchases. Within the pharmacy industry, branded mix impacts and heightened regulatory and reimbursement complexities are putting pressure on the pricing dynamics. Sales in this segment heavily rely on prescription drug reimbursements from a limited number of pharmacy benefit management (PBM) companies, with the recent changes in NADAC (National Average Drug Acquisition Cost) pricing creating more volatility. Added to this, worldwide supply-chain disruptions, along with an uncertain economic and geopolitical environment, are leading to inflationary pressures and rising input costs. All these factors are expected to have negatively weighed upon Walgreens\u2019 bottom line in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. On a promising note, U.S. Pharmacy sales are likely to have increased, with prescription scripts tracking in line with the overall prescription market year to date. The focus on value-seeking behavior and new product introductions are likely to have contributed to higher brand penetration. We also expect an improvement in the Retail adjusted gross margin due to the category mix toward health and wellness products. Story Continues The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects Walgreens\u2019 U.S. retail pharmacy revenues to increase modestly by 0.9% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. International The segment is expected to have benefited from the strong performance of Germany wholesale. Boots UK is likely to have continued the momentum in the fiscal first quarter of 2025, with comparable retail sales also rising and market share gains across all categories. According to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, Walgreens\u2019 International business revenues are projected to improve by 1.4% year over year. U.S. Healthcare In the fiscal 2025 first quarter, Walgreens is expected to have delivered strong revenues driven by Shields Health Solutions, which grew 28% in the fiscal fourth quarter on the strength of its existing partnerships. VillageMD\u2019s sales are likely to have benefited from growth in full-risk lives and fee-for-service revenues. Operationally, the segment may have delivered another quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the U.S. Healthcare segment\u2019s revenues are projected to increase 5.9% year over year in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, Walgreens delivered its targeted annual cost savings in fiscal 2024 through its Transformational Cost Management Program. Many of these initiatives are likely to have extended into this fiscal year, with the company likely making further progress in the fiscal 2025 first quarter. Walgreens is expected to have advanced its efforts to improve operating leverage, including speeding up the footprint optimization program. However, for quite some time now, WBA has been considering selling all of its VillageMD businesses, as per multiple sources. Last year, WBA announced that it would close 160 VillageMD clinics after incurring a $6 billion net loss in the fiscal 2024 second quarter. Any sell-off, if taken place in the fiscal first quarter, could lead to a significant impact on the top line for the to-be-reported quarter. WBA Stock Price Performance Walgreens shares have struggled in the past year, plummeting 62.9% compared with the industry\u2019s 47.2% decline and the S&P 500\u2019s 25.9% growth. In contrast, peers like CVS Health CVS and Herbalife Ltd. HLF have experienced 43.2% and 50.5% respective declines in their shares in the same time frame. 1-Year Price Comparison Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research WBA Stock Looks Cheap Based on the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), Walgreens shares are trading at a multiple of 6.44X, lower than the industry average of 7.23X and its median of 8.76X. P/E Ratio Forward Twelve Months (F12M) Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Walgreens\u2019 Investment Thesis Per the company, 2025 will be an important rebasing year to drive longer-term value creation. Walgreens had conducted a strategic review, a critical objective of which was to respond to changing consumer behavior and buying preferences. Several retail initiatives are being executed over multiple periods in response to this dynamic. WBA announced an acceleration of its footprint optimization program to close approximately 1,200 underperforming stores over the next three years and reduce the fixed costs associated with them. It is also refining its product offering by being more selective with national brands and expanding its own branded products, particularly in health and wellness and women\u2019s health. Walgreens is also prioritizing a disciplined financial approach, aiming for strong cash flow and operating leverage. Its near-term approach is to improve its operating cash flows through cost and working capital management while laying the groundwork for AOI (Adjusted Operating Income) growth. For this fiscal, the company is targeting $500 million in working capital initiatives and plans to cut another $150 million in capital expenditures. Walgreens is exploring options to monetize non-core assets, such as VillageMD, where it currently holds a majority position. Proceeds from the potential sale of all or part of the businesses, restructuring or other better alternatives would be redeployed toward reducing the net debt and improving the overall balance sheet. The company\u2019s latest move signals a departure from its initial strategy of expanding into value-based primary care, a fast-growing healthcare market. Walgreens is also working with PBMs to secure more stabilized, predictable reimbursement rates.\u00a0 The company has strong visibility into reimbursement for nearly 80% of its expected prescription volume in fiscal 2025 and is encouraged by some PBM partners who are open to adjusting reimbursement based on current market trends. WBA is expanding the reimbursed services through strategic efforts, such as provider status and other new payment arrangements. All these efforts are expected to materialize over time, supported by additional steps. By fully deploying pharmacist capabilities, Walgreens aims to lighten the burden on the broader healthcare system and stabilize and improve the overall pharmacy economics. How to Play WBA Stock? Walgreens is prioritizing stabilizing its core operations and making progress on the long-term strategic and operational turnaround. However, price-sensitive consumer behavior will continue to put pressure on U.S. Retail Pharmacy businesses. Investors currently holding Walgreens stock may find it beneficial to sell. Despite the stock\u2019s lower valuation, it is best for prospective investors to steer away for now. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Near 52-Week Low: Should You Buy the Dip? Urmimala Biswas Mon, Jan 6, 2025, 6:22 PM 6 min read In This Article: CVS -0.63% CVS Health CVS shareholders are experiencing a rough period as the stock continues to face significant downward pressure. Recent reports about the company's strategic restructuring plans have placed the healthcare giant back in the headlines, raising concerns about its long-term stability and growth prospects. To address mounting financial pressure, CVS is reportedly considering a strategic restructuring that involves reducing costs by $2 billion, which could result in 2,900 job cuts. Accordingly, CVS Health experienced a significant dip in its share price, with its stock currently trading close to its 52-week low. Since Dec. 17, the stock has consistently traded below $46.00 per share, closing at $45.77 yesterday and just above its 52-week low of $43.56, reached on Dec. 23. The stock has lost 29.9% in the past three months, underperforming the Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry\u2019s 29% dip and the S&P 500's growth of 3.8%. During this period, the Retail sector rose 7%. Notably, CVS has also underperformed its direct peers and behemoths like Walgreens Boots WBA and Herbalife HLF in the past three months. During the said time frame, WBA gained 7.1%, while HLF lost 3.2%. Three-Month Price Comparison Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research CVS Below Moving Averages Technical indicators, too, are showing further resistance to CVS Health\u2019s growth momentum. The stock is trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating chances of further downward momentum and price instability. This technical indicator reflects the market\u2019s lack of confidence in CVS Health\u2019s financial health and fundamentals both for the short and long term. 50 & 200-Day SMA Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Meanwhile, earnings estimates for CVS Health have slipped 17.5% to $5.29 per share for 2024 over the past 60 days, with 12 downward revisions in contrast to one upward movement. For 2025, estimates have declined 14.1% to $6.14 in two months following 11 downward revisions and one upward movement. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research For shareholders, the combination of declining stock performance, substantial job cuts and operational challenges presents a challenging landscape. Industry-wide Pharmacy Reimbursement Crisis We note that the entire retail pharmacy industry is currently grappling with continued pressure from non-reimbursable pharmacy expenses, which are significantly pulling down mass demand for prescription as well as over-the-counter drugs and vaccinations. Going by a National Association of Chain Drugs report, payors are substantially shrinking reimbursement, many times below the cost of buying and dispensing prescription drugs. This is putting substantial and unsustainable financial pressure on companies to the extent that many of the industry players over the past year were seen shutting down their businesses, reducing the number of stores or going private. Story Continues CVS Health, like its industry peers, is severely affected by this ongoing crisis. In fact, despite the company reporting revenue expansion, shrinking margins and earnings are pretty alarming. Escalating Medical Benefit Ratio a Cause of Concern CVS Health\u2019s Medicaid business is experiencing medical cost pressure from higher-than-expected acuity following the resumption of member redeterminations. During the third quarter, the medical benefit ratio (MBR) of 95.2% increased 950 basis points year over year.\u00a0 A higher MBR typically indicates that the company paid out more in benefits than what it collected in premiums, resulting in lower profitability. CVS Health also witnessed unfavorable development of 2024 medical costs related to second-quarter dates of service, which adversely impacted its trend outlook for the rest of 2024. Medical costs in the individual exchange business also accelerated in the third quarter, with broad levels of higher utilization and surging medical costs in certain high-cost geographies. CVS Health increased its risk adjustment accrual for its individual exchange business by approximately $275 million in the third quarter due to updated data. The company will continue to evaluate its revenue accruals for potential additional pressure as it receives updated data on the risk scores later this year and in early 2025. Expensive Valuation In terms of valuation, CVS Health\u2019s forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) is 7.44X, a premium to the broader industry average of 6.99X. The company is also trading at a significant premium to other industry players like Walgreens Boots (6.44X) and Herbalife (3.97X). This suggests that investors may be paying a higher price relative to the company's expected earnings growth. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 2025 Might Provide a Better Picture CVS Health is optimistic regarding its path forward in 2025 and beyond, which involves strengthening its positioning in Medicare Advantage. In June 2024, the company submitted its bids for the plan following a rigorous internal review. Management is confident about 2025 pricing, which is based on prudent assumptions for utilization trends. It expects these actions to drive 100 to 200 basis points of margin recovery in 2025 compared to its current baseline performance. This will be the first stage in a three to four-year journey to re-establish the company's target margins of 4 to 5%. Improved Star Ratings in 2025 might generate a $700 million tailwind, depending on membership retention levels. The rest of the gains in the company\u2019s 2025 margin will be driven by pricing initiatives in an environment where it is experiencing headwinds from an insufficient rate notice and prescription medication coverage changes that significantly raise plan liability. CVS Health will implement material price and benefit design adjustments in 2025, with the impact determined by how cost trends evolve in the year, as well as how the market responds to those trends. Furthermore, CVS\u2019 subsidiary Signify Health continues to show impressive growth and is building momentum for 2025. CVS Health is progressing on its innovative pharmacy models and biosimilar strategy, delivering wins in both Caremark and Aetna selling season and also fast advancing the integration of healthcare delivery assets. Overall, the company is taking steps to achieve profitable growth in 2025, focusing on a disciplined financial policy to strengthen its balance sheet. Supported by strong leadership and a powerful collection of businesses in some of the most critical areas of healthcare, CVS Health aims to deliver value for customers, colleagues and shareholders. Our Take Thanks to several business-specific and industry-wide factors, the market has not been impressed with CVS Health this year. In addition to the ongoing controversy related to massive job cut, the company has been grappling with a sudden increase in Medicare Advantage members\u2019 utilization trend within the Health Care Benefits segment, where an increasing number of members are opting for health benefits. The stock is currently positioned below its 50-and 200-day moving averages. Accordingly, we consider the possibility of a resistance or further pullback in share price going forward. Further, the current stretched valuation suggests that investors may be paying a higher price relative to the company's expected earnings growth. Therefore, despite the company holding brighter prospects for 2025, this might not be the ideal time to invest in CVS Health. While current shareholders should hold their positions, new investors should wait for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock to retract some of its recent gains and provide a better entry point.

(Simply Wall St) Mon, Dec 30, 2024, 1:56 PM 3 min read In This Article: HLNFF +0.46% When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, long term High Liner Foods Incorporated ( TSE:HLF ) shareholders have enjoyed a 97% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 43% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 41% in the last year, including dividends. So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for High Liner Foods To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement. Over half a decade, High Liner Foods managed to grow its earnings per share at 41% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 14% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock. The reasonably low P/E ratio of 5.42 also suggests market apprehension. You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). TSX:HLF Earnings Per Share Growth December 30th 2024 It's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here. . What About Dividends? As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, High Liner Foods' TSR for the last 5 years was 133%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return. A Different Perspective It's nice to see that High Liner Foods shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 41% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 18% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF)? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 10:16 PM 3 min read In This Article: HLF -1.70% Herbalife Ltd. ( NYSE:HLF ), is not the largest company out there, but it received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. While good news for shareholders, the company has traded much higher in the past year. As a stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s examine Herbalife\u2019s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there\u2019s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for Herbalife Is Herbalife Still Cheap? Good news, investors! Herbalife is still a bargain right now according to our price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. We\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there\u2019s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock\u2019s ratio of 10.04x is currently well-below the industry average of 29.41x, meaning that it is trading at a cheaper price relative to its peers. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Herbalife\u2019s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company\u2019s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity. What does the future of Herbalife look like? NYSE:HLF Earnings and Revenue Growth November 26th 2024 Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Herbalife's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value. What This Means For You Are you a shareholder? Since HLF is currently trading below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic profit outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current price multiple. Are you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on HLF for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future profit outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy HLF. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.

Market Update As expected, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 25bps (a quarter of a percent) in November 2024 after Donald Trump triumphed in the US Presidential election. This marks the central bank's second easing of monetary policy after a large 50bps rate cut two months earlier. Going forward, the markets will debate whether these rate cuts (and more potential ones in 2025) are perfect timing to support the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much. Adding to the degree of difficulty is a new Republican administration that could make large changes to corporate taxes and prior efforts such as the Inflation Reduction Act.

One Stock to Buy Instead Petr Hu\u0159\u0165\u00e1k Fri, Dec 6, 2024, 11:05 AM 3 min read In This Article: HLF -1.70% Three Reasons Why HLF is Risky and One Stock to Buy Instead Shareholders of Herbalife would probably like to forget the past six months even happened. The stock dropped 28.7% and now trades at $8.15. This may have investors wondering how to approach the situation. Is now the time to buy Herbalife, or should you be careful about including it in your portfolio? Check out our in-depth research report to see what our analysts have to say, it\u2019s free . Despite the more favorable entry price, we're sitting this one out for now. Here are three reasons why there are better opportunities than HLF and a stock we'd rather own. Why Is Herbalife Not Exciting? With the first products sold out of the trunk of the founder\u2019s car, Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) today offers a portfolio of shakes, supplements, personal care products, and weight management programs to help customers reach their nutritional and fitness goals. 1. Demand Slipping as Sales Volumes Decline Revenue growth can be broken down into changes in price and volume (the number of units sold). While both are important, volume is the lifeblood of a successful staples business as there\u2019s a ceiling to what consumers will pay for everyday goods; they can always trade down to non-branded products if the branded versions are too expensive. Herbalife\u2019s average quarterly sales volumes have shrunk by 7.5% over the last two years. This decrease isn\u2019t ideal because the quantity demanded for consumer staples products is typically stable. Herbalife Year-On-Year Volume Growth 2. Core Business Falling Behind as Demand Plateaus When analyzing revenue growth, we care most about organic revenue growth. This metric captures a business\u2019s performance excluding one-time events such as mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures as well as foreign currency fluctuations. The demand for Herbalife\u2019s products has barely risen over the last eight quarters. On average, the company\u2019s organic sales have been flat. Herbalife Year-On-Year Organic Revenue Growth 3. EPS Trending Down We track the change in earnings per share (EPS) because it highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable. Sadly for Herbalife, its EPS declined by more than its revenue over the last three years, dropping 27.2% annually. This tells us the company struggled because its fixed cost base made it difficult to adjust to shrinking demand. Herbalife Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) Final Judgment Herbalife isn\u2019t a terrible business, but it doesn\u2019t pass our bar. Following the recent decline, the stock trades at 4.4\u00d7 forward price-to-earnings (or $8.15 per share). While this valuation is optically cheap, the potential downside is big given its shaky fundamentals. We're pretty confident there are superior stocks to buy right now. Let us point you toward Uber, whose profitability just reached an inflection point . Story Continues Stocks We Like More Than Herbalife The elections are now behind us. With rates dropping and inflation cooling, many analysts expect a breakout market to cap off the year - and we\u2019re zeroing in on the stocks that could benefit immensely. Take advantage of the rebound by checking out our Top 5 Growth Stocks for this month . This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 175% over the last five years.

Liner Foods Incorporated ( TSE:HLF ) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 15th of December to $0.17. This makes the dividend yield 4.4%, which is above the industry average. See our latest analysis for High Liner Foods High Liner Foods' Future Dividend Projections Appear Well Covered By Earnings If the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. However, prior to this announcement, High Liner Foods' dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business. Over the next year, EPS could expand by 40.7% if recent trends continue. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 21%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend. TSX:HLF Historic Dividend November 12th 2024 Dividend Volatility Although the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.338 in 2014 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.43. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 2.4% per annum over that time. It's encouraging to see some dividend growth, but the dividend has been cut at least once, and the size of the cut would eliminate most of the growth anyway, which makes this less attractive as an income investment. The Dividend Looks Likely To Grow With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. High Liner Foods has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 41% per annum. A low payout ratio gives the company a lot of flexibility, and growing earnings also make it very easy for it to grow the dividend. We Really Like High Liner Foods' Dividend In summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity. Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

Profits May Be Masking Some Underlying Issues editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sat, Nov 16, 2024, 5:26 PM 2 min read In This Article: HLNFF +0.46% Following the solid earnings report from High Liner Foods Incorporated ( TSE:HLF ), the market responded by bidding up the stock price. However, we think that shareholders should be cautious as we found some worrying factors underlying the profit. View our latest analysis for High Liner Foods TSX:HLF Earnings and Revenue History November 16th 2024 How Do Unusual Items Influence Profit? Importantly, our data indicates that High Liner Foods' profit received a boost of US$20m in unusual items, over the last year. While it's always nice to have higher profit, a large contribution from unusual items sometimes dampens our enthusiasm. We ran the numbers on most publicly listed companies worldwide, and it's very common for unusual items to be once-off in nature. And that's as you'd expect, given these boosts are described as 'unusual'. High Liner Foods had a rather significant contribution from unusual items relative to its profit to September 2024. All else being equal, this would likely have the effect of making the statutory profit a poor guide to underlying earnings power. That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates. Our Take On High Liner Foods' Profit Performance As we discussed above, we think the significant positive unusual item makes High Liner Foods' earnings a poor guide to its underlying profitability.

Nonetheless, it's still worth noting that its earnings per share have grown at 50% over the last three years.

bit of revenge Charley Blaine Mon, Dec 16, 2024, 8:53 PM 4 min read In This Article: IEP +1.02% HLF -1.70% FNMA -6.18% In late 2012, Bill Ackman started one of the more celebrated battles over corporate control, when he charged that the supplement company Herbalife Nutrition ( HLF ) was a pyramid scheme. Ackman, head of hedge fund firm Pershing Square Square Capital Management, had a huge short position in Herbalife's stock. Short-sellers bet on drops in stock prices; they do best if a stock price drops to zero. \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb8 Don\u2019t miss the move: SIGN UP for TheStreet\u2019s FREE Daily newsletter \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb8 The fight brought in Carl Icahn, a legendary and feared billionaire, who was \u2014 and still is \u2014 not one to trifle with. Icahn had had dealings with Ackman before. One bad deal forced him to write Ackman a large check. And Icahn decided to support Herbalife. Related: Veteran analyst who predicted the S&P 500's rally unveils target for 2025 The fight went on for nearly six years, with millions spent on high-priced lawyers, PR people and more lawyers. There was even a bit of live television so dramatic that NYSE trading slowed to a trickle. And when the dust settled, Ackman ended his fight, with a loss of maybe $1 billion for his effort. Herbalife is still alive but struggling. Its shares reached $58.20 in February 2021. The shares closed at $7.48 on Friday, down 87% from that 2021 peak. Analysts mostly rate the stock a hold. Revenue at around $5 billion\u00a0is barely growing. Ackman's Pershing Square is still going strong, and he is in another tussle involving Carl Icahn, though Icahn himself is not a participant.

The contest sponsor is the Robin Hood Foundation , which is committed to alleviating poverty in New York City and has a second goal of providing emergency funds in the event of a disaster in the New York City region. The foundation has an A-list roster of donors and supporters from Wall Street to the media and the arts, and it made $117.6 million in grants in 2023. In November 2024 alone the grants totaled $40 million. Carl Icahn, chairman of Icahn Enterprises, at a CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha Conference in 2016. CNBC/Getty Images The contest to see who's a great investment picker The foundation has raised about $400,000 for its Pick-a-Ticker contest, including\u00a0$10,000 from each of the contestants. Thirty-five players are in the competition: all money managers, all male and mostly from money-management firms in New York. Each contestant has to take two fictitious positions: One long position. That is, buying to hold something. One short position. That is, betting that the value will decline. Story Continues The winner is whoever generates the highest total return from his two picks. The foundation gets two-thirds of the pot. The winner can direct which charity gets the last third of the cash. Most entrants are saying their winnings will go to the foundation.

Fed inflation gauge higher in October amid consumer spending boost Goldman Sachs analyst sees starting point for year-end S&P 500 rally Ackman's positions are: Long: Federal National Mortgage Association ( FNMA ) , better known as Fannie Mae. Fannie Mae is one of the biggest sources of mortgage capital to residential real estate. It essentially collapsed in the 2008 financial crisis and has been a ward of the government ever since. There's talk the second Trump administration will try to privatize Fannie Mae, along with Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. ( FMCC ) , known as Freddie Mac. Short: Icahn Enterprises ( IEP ) , Carl Icahn's company. The company has $17.4 billion in assets. Technically, Icahn Enterprises is a master limited partnership, which gives Icahn, the general partner, just about all power. The company's interests include investments, energy, automotive, food packaging and real estate. Ackman is beating all his competitors with his gain so far: 112.5% as of Dec. 11. His nearest competitor is up only 63%. Here's why Ackman is doing so well: Fannie Mae is up about 83%. Icahn Enterprises has fallen around 30% because a short-seller says the assets are overvalued, and the company is operating with unsustainable dividend payments. We'll see whether Ackman can keep his lead. And whether Icahn cares.
