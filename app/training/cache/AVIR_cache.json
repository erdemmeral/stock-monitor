(Nasdaq: AVIR) (Atea or Company), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of oral antiviral therapeutics for serious viral diseases, will outline the Company\u2019s strategic priorities for 2025 at the 43 rd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. Atea will present its plans for the regimen of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir, which the Company is advancing into a Phase 3 program for the treatment of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and present data from market research studies supporting the commercial market opportunity. Further information can be found in the Company\u2019s presentation here . The Company also reports its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of\u00a0$454.7 million at December 31, 2024 and a cash runway anticipated into 2028. Despite the availability of direct-acting antivirals, HCV continues to be a significant global healthcare issue. An estimated 50 million people worldwide are chronically infected with HCV and there are approximately one million new infections each year. In the US, between 2.4 and 4 million people are estimated to have HCV with annual new infections outpacing treatment rates. Chronic HCV infection is the leading cause of liver cancer in the US, Europe and Japan. \u201cAtea has an exciting year ahead with our planned initiation of a global Phase 3 program for the regimen of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir for the treatment of HCV. Our potential best-in-class regimen offers drug potency and forgiveness with convenient, short treatment duration, low risk of drug-drug interactions and no food effect. Our US market research confirms that this profile provides a significant opportunity to address the large burden of untreated HCV disease and play a major role in the eradication of HCV,\u201d said Jean-Pierre Sommadossi, PhD, Chief Executive Officer and founder of Atea. \u201cWe believe our regimen, if approved, has the opportunity to disrupt the global HCV market of approximately $3 billion in annual net sales.\u201d In recent surveys conducted for Atea, US healthcare providers report a high likelihood of prescribing the regimen of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir, if approved, and US payors are receptive to inclusion of the regimen on formulary based on its differentiated profile. 1 Story Continues Anticipated Global Phase 3 Program for HCV In December 2024, Atea announced that its Phase 2 study evaluating the regimen of bemnifosbuvir, a nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor, and ruzasvir, an NS5A inhibitor, for treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV), met its primary endpoints. Based on these positive results, Atea has an End-of-Phase 2 meeting scheduled with the US Food and Drug Administration later this month to review the Phase 3 program. In the global Phase 3 program, Atea expects to conduct two open label Phase 3 trials, one in the US and Canada and one outside of North America. Each trial will enroll up to 800 treatment-na\u00efve HCV patients, both with and without compensated cirrhosis. For non-cirrhotic patients, who comprise more than 90% of patients in the US, Atea expects to evaluate the efficacy of eight weeks of treatment in with the once-daily fixed dose tablet of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir versus 12 weeks of treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. For cirrhotic patients, 12 weeks of treatment with the once-daily fixed dose tablet of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir will be evaluated versus 12 weeks of treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. The primary endpoint is expected to be sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12). About the Phase 2 Study The\u00a0global Phase 2 study evaluating the regimen of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir for treatment of HCV met its primary endpoints of safety and SVR12. Primary endpoint results demonstrated a 98% (208/213) SVR12 rate in the per-protocol treatment adherent patient population after eight weeks of treatment with the regimen of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir. The efficacy evaluable patient population, which included 17% treatment non-adherent patients, achieved a 95% (242/256) SVR12 rate demonstrating the robust potency and forgiveness of the regimen. The regimen was generally safe and well-tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events or treatment discontinuations. Full data from the Phase 2 study are anticipated to be presented at a scientific meeting during the first half of 2025. The global Phase 2 study enrolled 275 treatment-na\u00efve patients, both with and without compensated cirrhosis. The study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of eight weeks of treatment with the regimen consisting of once-daily bemnifosbuvir 550 mg and ruzasvir 180 mg. The primary endpoints of the study were safety and SVR12 in the per-protocol treatment adherent population. Secondary and other endpoints included SVR12 in the per-protocol population regardless of treatment adherence (efficacy evaluable), virologic failure and resistance. About Bemnifosbuvir and Ruzasvir for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Bemnifosbuvir has been shown in in vitro studies to be approximately 10-fold more active than sofosbuvir (SOF) against a panel of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HCV GT 1\u20135. In vitro studies have also demonstrated that bemnifosbuvir remained fully active against SOF resistance-associated substitutions (S282T), with up to 58-fold more potency than SOF. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of bemnifosbuvir supports once-daily dosing for the treatment of HCV. Bemnifosbuvir has been shown to have a low risk for drug-drug interactions. Bemnifosbuvir has been administered to over 2,200 subjects and has been well-tolerated at doses up to 550 mg for durations up to 12 weeks in healthy subjects and patients. Ruzasvir has demonstrated highly potent and pan-genotypic antiviral activity in preclinical (picomolar range) and clinical studies. Ruzasvir has been administered to over 1,500 HCV-infected patients at daily doses of up to 180 mg for 12 weeks and has demonstrated a favorable safety profile. The PK profile of ruzasvir supports once-daily dosing. About Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) HCV is a blood-borne, positive-sense, single-stranded (ss) RNA virus that primarily infects liver cells. HCV is a leading cause of chronic liver disease and liver transplants, spreading via blood transfusion, hemodialysis and needle sticks, with 242,000 deaths occurring each year. Most HCV-related deaths are due to liver scarring (cirrhosis) and liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma). HCV infections in the US predominate in patients in the age group between 20-49 years old, and it is estimated that less than 10% of the HCV infected patients in the US have cirrhosis. About Atea Pharmaceuticals Atea is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing oral antiviral therapies to address the unmet medical needs of patients with serious viral infections. Leveraging Atea\u2019s deep understanding of antiviral drug development, nucleos(t)ide chemistry, biology, biochemistry and virology, Atea has built a proprietary nucleos(t)ide prodrug platform to develop novel product candidates to treat single stranded ribonucleic acid, or ssRNA, viruses, which are a prevalent cause of serious viral diseases. Atea plans to continue to build its pipeline of antiviral product candidates by augmenting its nucleos(t)ide platform with other classes of antivirals that may be used in combination with its nucleos(t)ide product candidates. Our lead program and current focus is on the development of the combination of bemnifosbuvir, a nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor, and ruzasvir, an NS5A inhibitor, to treat HCV.

(Nasdaq: AVIR) (Atea or Company), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of oral antiviral therapeutics for serious viral diseases, today announced that it has engaged Evercore, a global independent investment bank, to identify potential opportunities to enhance shareholder value, including the exploration of strategic partnerships related to its Phase 3-ready program for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV). The Company has not set a timetable for the conclusion of its review and has not made any decisions at this time. The Company does not intend to comment further with respect to this review unless or until its Board of Directors has approved a definitive course of action, the review process has concluded, or it is determined that other disclosure is appropriate. There is no assurance that this process will result in the completion of any specific transaction or outcome. About Atea Pharmaceuticals Atea is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing oral antiviral therapies to address the unmet medical needs of patients with serious viral infections.

https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/cigna-price-target-lowered-to-350-from-400-at-cantor-fitzgerald Atea Pharmaceuticals ( AVIR ) announced that the Company\u2019s Phase 2 study of the regimen of bemnifosbuvir, a nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor, and ruzasvir, an NS5A inhibitor, for treatment of hepatitis C virus met its primary endpoints of safety and sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post-treatment. Primary endpoint results demonstrated a 98% SVR12 rate in the per-protocol treatment adherent patient population after eight weeks of treatment with a regimen of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir. The efficacy evaluable patient population, which included 17% treatment non-adherent patients, achieved a 95% SVR12 rate demonstrating the robust potency and forgiveness of the regimen. The regimen was generally safe and well-tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events or treatment discontinuations. An accompanying slide deck with the topline Phase 2 results is available on Atea\u2019s website here. Full data for the Phase 2 study are anticipated to be presented at a scientific meeting during the first half of 2025.

Shareholder-Oriented Lead Independent Director to Oversee Strategic Review Process Business Wire Thu, Dec 19, 2024, 1:05 AM 4 min read HOUSTON, December 18, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Bradley L. Radoff and Michael Torok, the Managing Director of JEC Capital Partners (together with their affiliates, the \"Concerned Shareholder Group\" or \"we\"), who collectively own approximately 3% of the outstanding shares of Atea Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: AVIR) (\"Atea\" or the \"Company\"), today issued the following open letter to the Company\u2019s Board of Directors: *** December 18, 2024 Board of Directors (the \"Board\") Atea Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 225 Franklin Street, Suite 2100 Boston, MA 02110 Directors, We own approximately 3% of the outstanding shares of Atea, collectively making us one of its largest shareholders. We are writing to express our concerns about the Company\u2019s share price performance, strategy, capital allocation, and corporate governance. On December 10, 2024, we met with Chief Financial Officer Andrea Corcoran, Chief Medical Officer Arantxa Horga, and Chief Commercial Officer John Vavricka. During that meeting, Ms. Horga was adamant that the Phase 2 data from the Bemnifosbuvir and Ruzasvir study was outstanding. Mr. Vavricka reiterated that Atea would only commercialize its drug with a partner, stating his belief that the partner market would be robust. On December 12, 2024, we met with Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jean-Pierre Sommadossi, who was similarly confident, stating his belief that many parties would be potentially interested in commercializing Atea\u2019s treatment. We agree that the results of the Company\u2019s Phase 2 study were overwhelmingly positive. Based on the Company\u2019s net cash balance, we are extremely confident the Board can deliver shareholders $4.75 per share in cash, a more than 50% return over the current share price. We believe there could be additional, more significant upside from the monetization of the Company\u2019s sole clinical asset through the recently announced review of strategic alternatives with Evercore. If the Company and Evercore cannot find a buyer for Atea\u2019s only clinical asset, then we expect the Board to liquidate the Company and return all remaining cash to shareholders. In furtherance of the decision to wind down the Company in the absence of a transaction, we believe the Board should immediately take all available steps to reduce costs and conserve cash. Incredibly, despite the failure of Atea\u2019s Phase 3 study for the treatment of COVID-19, Atea has not disclosed any cost reduction initiatives. Despite our belief that there is an opportunity to deliver shareholders an immediate 50%-plus return based solely on the net cash balance, we lack confidence in the current Board\u2019s ability to surface value for stockholders based on its recent actions. In May of 2023, the Board rejected an unsolicited bid from Tang Capital Partners, LP (\"Tang Capital\") that would have paid Atea stockholders $5.75 per share in cash, plus a contingent value right through which stockholders would have the right to receive 80% of the net proceeds from Atea drug programs. 1 In December of 2024, 18 months after the Board rejected Tang Capital\u2019s proposal and mere days after the Company disclosed best-in-class data from its Phase 2 trial, Lead Independent Director Franklin M. Berger sold nearly half of his shareholdings at a 50% discount to Atea\u2019s net cash balance. Story Continues We believe this is the appropriate time to sell the Company. However, we are concerned that Mr. Berger is not qualified to represent Atea shareholders in any matter \u2013 let alone in the Company\u2019s strategic review \u2013 given that he recently sold 359,606 shares at $2.84 per share, a fraction of the net cash value of the shares and at or near the Company\u2019s all-time-low share price. 2 Again, Mr. Berger\u2019s open market stock sales occurred on the heels of positive Phase 2 data and on the eve of a strategic review process to maximize shareholder value. We hereby demand that Mr. Berger immediately resigns from the Atea Board. Furthermore, we believe the Board should work with its shareholders to identify and appoint a new, mutually agreed upon Lead Independent Director. We look forward to engaging with the Board in the coming days to agree on a qualified, shareholder-oriented Lead Independent Director to replace Mr. Berger. Sincerely, Bradley Radoff and Michael Torok _________________________ 1 Company press release dated May 30, 2023 ( link ). 2 Company Form 4 filed by Franklin M.

Topline SVR12 Results from Global Phase 2 Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Study (N=275) Expected Q4\u201924 New Data Supportive of HCV Combination to be Presented at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases\u2019 (AASLD\u2019s) The Liver Meeting 2024 Pharmacokinetic Data for Bemnifosbuvir to be Presented at American College of Pharmacometrics Meeting Conference Call at 4:30 pm ET Today BOSTON, Nov. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Atea Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: AVIR) (Atea or Company), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of oral antiviral therapeutics for serious viral diseases, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 and provided a business update. \u201cWe continue to make significant progress in our HCV program with the combination of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir, which has a potential best-in-class profile. In the near term, we look forward to sharing topline results in early December from our Phase 2 combination study and initiating the global Phase 3 program early next year,\u201d said Jean-Pierre Sommadossi, PhD, Chief Executive Officer and Founder of Atea Pharmaceuticals. \u201cThe unrelenting high rate of new HCV infections underscores the need for new innovative therapies that can address the unmet needs of today\u2019s HCV patients, particularly those with substance abuse disorders and comorbidities. The HCV commercial market is expected to remain large, with global\u00a0net\u00a0sales exceeding $3 billion,\u00a0with\u00a0the US accounting\u00a0for approximately half of this market. Based on our target profile\u00a0that is convenient, short treatment duration with a low risk of drug-drug interactions, we are confident that our combination, if approved, has the potential to gain significant market share and could\u00a0increase the number of patients cured.\u201d Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Phase 2 HCV Combination Study: Atea is currently completing a global Phase 2 clinical study evaluating the combination of bemnifosbuvir, a nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor, and ruzasvir, an NS5A inhibitor, for the treatment of HCV. This study, which has enrolled 275 treatment-na\u00efve patients, both with and without compensated cirrhosis, is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of eight weeks of treatment with the combination consisting of once-daily bemnifosbuvir 550 mg and ruzasvir 180 mg. The primary endpoints of the study are safety and sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12) in the per-protocol treatment adherent population. Secondary and other endpoints include SVR12 in the per-protocol population regardless of treatment adherence (efficacy evaluable), virologic failure and resistance. Atea expects to report topline Phase 2 SVR12 results from this study in early December 2024. Story Continues At the European Association of the Study of the Liver (EASL) Congress in June 2024, Atea presented clinical data from the lead-in cohort (n=60) of the ongoing Phase 2 study. With an 8-week treatment duration, data from the lead-in cohort of non-cirrhotic patients showed a 97% SVR12 rate in efficacy evaluable patients. Two subjects (GT1b and GT2b) experienced post-treatment relapse or failure. Each of these patients had low plasma drug levels and similar viral mutations at both the baseline and 12-weeks post-treatment timepoint, which indicated that the relapse or failure was due to treatment non-adherence rather than viral resistance. These results also showed a 100% SVR12 rate in participants infected with genotype 3 (n=13), a historically difficult-to-treat genotype of HCV. In the lead-in cohort, the combination regimen was well tolerated, with no drug-related serious adverse events or treatment discontinuations. Data also presented at EASL included additional preclinical data further demonstrating a high barrier to resistance and favorable pharmacokinetics (PK) for bemnifosbuvir and a low risk of drug-drug interactions for ruzasvir. Atea has previously reported a low risk of drug-drug interactions for bemnifosbuvir. Atea is currently planning for an End of Phase 2 meeting with the US Food and Drug Administration early in the first quarter of 2025 to support the initiation of the Phase 3 program. Atea has selected and is manufacturing a fixed dose combination (FDC) tablet for its upcoming Phase 3 program. The FDC tablet reduces the daily pill count from four to two tablets, enhancing patient convenience, with no food effect demonstrated in recent studies. New Data Presentations at Upcoming Scientific Meetings At The Liver Meeting 2024, being held from November 15-19, 2024, three posters supportive of the combination of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir as a potential treatment for HCV will be presented. The posters detail additional safety and resistance data for bemnifosbuvir and present multiscale modeling data estimating the effectiveness of the combination of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir in blocking HCV replication and viral assembly and secretion. At the American College of Pharmacometrics meeting, being held on November 11, 2024, supportive data from an integrated population PK model that was developed to simultaneously characterize the PK profile of bemnifosbuvir and its metabolites will be presented. COVID-19 Phase 3 SUNRISE-3 Trial: In September 2024, Atea announced results from the Phase 3 SUNRISE-3 trial, a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating bemnifosbuvir in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. The trial did not meet its primary endpoint of a statistically significant reduction in all-cause hospitalization or death through Day 29. Total enrollment for the monotherapy cohort consisted of 2,221 high-risk patients randomized 1:1 to receive bemnifosbuvir 550 mg twice-daily (BID) or placebo BID for five days. In the trial, bemnifosbuvir was shown to be generally safe and well tolerated. The evolving nature of COVID-19, including milder disease presentations and a reduction in hospitalizations due to COVID-19 related severe respiratory disease, pose significant challenges in demonstrating a clinical impact with a direct-acting antiviral such as bemnifosbuvir. Given the trial results and the changing landscape of the pandemic, Atea will not pursue a regulatory pathway forward for bemnifosbuvir for COVID-19. Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities: $482.8 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $502.2 million at June 30, 2024. Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses decreased by $2.0 million from $28.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $26.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The net decrease was primarily driven by lower external spend related to our COVID-19 Phase 3 SUNRISE-3 clinical trial offset by higher spend related to our HCV Phase 2 clinical trial of the combination of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir. General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses decreased by $1.6 million from $12.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $11.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The net decrease was primarily related to lower professional fees. Interest Income and Other, Net: Interest income and other, net, decreased by $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower investment balances. Income Taxes: We recorded income tax expense of $0.2 million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

About Bemnifosbuvir and\u00a0Ruzasvir\u00a0for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Bemnifosbuvir has been shown in in vitro studies to be approximately 10-fold more active than sofosbuvir (SOF) against a panel of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HCV GT 1\u20135. In vitro studies have also demonstrated bemnifosbuvir remained fully active against SOF resistance-associated substitutions (S282T), with up to 58-fold more potency than SOF. The PK profile of bemnifosbuvir supports once-daily dosing for the treatment of HCV. Bemnifosbuvir has been shown to have a low risk for drug-drug interactions. Bemnifosbuvir has been administered to over 2,200 subjects and has been well-tolerated at doses up to 550 mg for durations up to 12 weeks in healthy subjects and patients. Ruzasvir has demonstrated highly potent and pan-genotypic antiviral activity in preclinical (picomolar range) and clinical studies. Ruzasvir has been administered to over 1,500 HCV-infected patients at daily doses of up to 180 mg for 12 weeks and has demonstrated a favorable safety profile. The PK profile of ruzasvir supports once-daily dosing.

After Failed COVID-19 Drug Trial, Atea Pharmaceuticals Touts Encouraging Data From Mid-Stage Hepatitis C Study Vandana Singh Wed, Dec 4, 2024, 11:14 PM 2 min read In This Article: AVIR After Failed COVID-19 Drug Trial, Atea Pharmaceuticals Touts Encouraging Data From Mid-Stage Hepatitis C Study On Wednesday, Atea Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVIR ) released Phase 2 study data from the regimen of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir for the hepatitis C virus infection that causes liver swelling and\u00a0can lead to serious liver damage . The study met its primary endpoints of safety and sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12). Primary endpoint results demonstrated a 98% (208/213) SVR12 rate in the per-protocol treatment adherent patient population after eight weeks of treatment with a regimen of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir. Also Read: Atea Pharmaceuticals\u2019 COVID-19 Treatment Flunks In Late-Stage Study, Blames\u2019 Constantly Evolving\u2019 Virus The efficacy evaluable patient population, which included 17% treatment non-adherent patients, achieved a 95% (242/256) SVR12 rate demonstrating the potency and forgiveness of the regimen. In June, Atea Pharmaceuticals shared new data from the lead-in cohort (n=60) of its ongoing Phase 2 combination study of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir for hepatitis C virus . The regimen was generally safe and well-tolerated, with no drug-related serious adverse events or treatment discontinuations. Full data for the Phase 2 study will be presented at a scientific meeting during the first half of 2025. In the Phase 2 study, 99% (178/179) of treatment-adherent patients who were non-cirrhotic and infected with genotypes 1-4 achieved SVR12, demonstrating robust pan-genotypic potency and supporting an eight-week treatment in the Phase 3 program. Treatment adherent patients with cirrhosis achieved a 88% (30/34) SVR12 rate. Viral kinetics were slower in these cirrhotic patients. However, all patients achieved 100% end-of-treatment response. To maximize efficacy, the Phase 3 program will extend treatment duration to 12 weeks in patients with cirrhosis. Atea is preparing for the Phase 3 program, which is expected to follow an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA anticipated for early 2025. The Phase 3 program is expected to use a fixed-dose combination tablet, reducing the daily pill count from four to two tablets and enhancing patient convenience, with no food effect. Price Action: AVIR stock is down 9.63% at $3.15 at the last check on Wednesday.

on Trump's tariffs Atea Pharmaceuticals Announces Positive Results from Phase 2 Study of Bemnifosbuvir and Ruzasvir Regimen for Treatment of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Atea Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Wed, Dec 4, 2024, 3:00 PM 8 min read In This Article: AVIR Atea Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Primary Endpoint Achieved with 98% Sustained Virologic Response at 12 Weeks Post-Treatment (SVR12) after Short Eight Week Treatment Duration Regimen Was Generally Safe and Well-Tolerated Global Phase 3 Program Initiation Expected Early in 2025 BOSTON, Dec. 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Atea Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: AVIR) (\u201cAtea\u201d or \u201cCompany\u201d), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of oral antiviral therapeutics for serious viral diseases, today announced that the Company\u2019s Phase 2 study of the regimen of bemnifosbuvir, a nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor, and ruzasvir, an NS5A inhibitor, for treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) met its primary endpoints of safety and sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12). Primary endpoint results demonstrated a 98% (208/213) SVR12 rate in the per-protocol treatment adherent patient population after eight weeks of treatment with a regimen of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir. The efficacy evaluable patient population, which included 17% treatment non-adherent patients, achieved a 95% (242/256) SVR12 rate demonstrating the robust potency and forgiveness of the regimen. The regimen was generally safe and well-tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events or treatment discontinuations. An accompanying slide deck with the topline Phase 2 results is available on Atea\u2019s website here . Full data for the Phase 2 study are anticipated to be presented at a scientific meeting during the first half of 2025. \u201cThese high SVR12 results with only eight weeks of treatment with our regimen are extremely exciting and very significant given the unmet needs for today\u2019s HCV patients. We are eager to discuss our program with regulators, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, to promptly advance to Phase 3 development early next year,\u201d said Jean-Pierre Sommadossi, PhD, Chief Executive Officer and Founder of Atea. \u201cThe HCV market continues to be underserved, and HCV diagnoses in the U.S. outpace treatment rates annually. Our regimen has a potential best-in-class profile that includes the key features for successfully treating today\u2019s HCV patients including convenience, low risk for drug-drug interactions and short treatment duration. We believe that this regimen has the potential to play a major role in the eradication of HCV in the U.S.\u201d In the Phase 2 study, 99% (178/179) of treatment adherent patients who were non-cirrhotic and infected with genotypes 1-4 achieved SVR12, demonstrating robust pan-genotypic potency and supporting an eight-week treatment in the Phase 3 program. Treatment adherent patients with cirrhosis achieved a 88% (30/34) SVR12 rate. Viral kinetics were slower in these cirrhotic patients, however, all patients achieved 100% end of treatment response. To maximize efficacy, treatment duration in patients with cirrhosis will be 12 weeks in the Phase 3 program. Based on the high proportion of people between 20-49 years old who are infected with HCV combined with the low and declining incidence of cirrhosis in newly-infected patients in the U.S., it is estimated that less than 10% of the HCV patient population has cirrhosis. Story Continues \u201cI\u2019ve experienced first-hand the changing population of HCV patients and the increasing importance of short duration therapy,\u201d said Eric Lawitz, MD, The Texas Liver Institute, Clinical Professor of Medicine, University of Texas Health San Antonio. \u201cOur current HCV patients are younger, and frequently taking concurrent medications for their comorbidities. More recently, there are also fewer patients presenting with cirrhosis. I\u2019m encouraged by these promising Phase 2 results and look forward to the Phase 3 program.\u201d Atea is currently preparing for the Phase 3 program, which is expected to follow an End of Phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) anticipated for early 2025. It is expected that the Phase 3 program will use a fixed dose combination (FDC) tablet reducing the daily pill count from four to two tablets, enhancing patient convenience, with no food effect. About the Phase 2 Study The global Phase 2 study enrolled 275 treatment-na\u00efve patients, both with and without compensated cirrhosis. The study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of eight weeks of treatment with the regimen consisting of once-daily bemnifosbuvir 550 mg and ruzasvir 180 mg. The primary endpoints of the study are safety and SVR12 in the per-protocol treatment adherent population. Secondary and other endpoints include SVR12 in the per-protocol population regardless of treatment adherence (efficacy evaluable), virologic failure and resistance. About Bemnifosbuvir and\u00a0Ruzasvir\u00a0for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Bemnifosbuvir has been shown in in vitro studies to be approximately 10-fold more active than sofosbuvir (SOF), against a panel of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HCV GT 1\u20135. In vitro studies have also demonstrated bemnifosbuvir remained fully active against SOF resistance-associated substitutions (S282T), with up to 58-fold more potency than SOF. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of bemnifosbuvir supports once-daily dosing for the treatment of HCV. Bemnifosbuvir has been shown to have a low risk for drug-drug interactions. Bemnifosbuvir has been administered to over 2,200 subjects and has been well-tolerated at doses up to 550 mg for durations up to 12 weeks in healthy subjects and patients. Ruzasvir has demonstrated highly potent and pan-genotypic antiviral activity in preclinical (picomolar range) and clinical studies. Ruzasvir has been administered to over 1,500 HCV-infected patients at daily doses of up to 180 mg for 12 weeks and has demonstrated a favorable safety profile. The PK profile of ruzasvir supports once-daily dosing. About Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a blood-borne, positive-sense, single-stranded (ss) RNA virus that primarily infects liver cells. HCV is a leading cause of chronic liver disease and liver transplants, spreading via blood transfusion, hemodialysis and needle sticks. An estimated 50 million people globally live with chronic HCV infection, with approximately 1 million new infections and 242,000 deaths occurring each year. Most HCV-related deaths are due to liver scarring (cirrhosis) and liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma). Injection drug use accounts for around 30% of new HCV cases globally and approximately 60% in the U.S., where between 2-4 million people are estimated to have HCV. It is estimated that less than 10% of patients in the U.S. infected with HCV have cirrhosis. Annually, HCV diagnoses in the U.S. outpace treatment rates, as less than a third of those diagnosed with HCV receive timely treatment. About Atea Pharmaceuticals Atea is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing oral antiviral therapies to address the unmet medical needs of patients with serious viral infections.
