[{"text": "Here's What Could Help DXP Enterprises (DXPE) Maintain Its Recent Price Strength Zacks Equity Research Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 4:50 PM 3 min read In This Article: DXPE -3.10% Most of us have heard the dictum \"the trend is your friend.\" And this is undeniably the key to success when it comes to short-term investing or trading. But it isn't easy to ensure the sustainability of a trend and profit from it. Often, the direction of a stock's price movement reverses quickly after taking a position in it, making investors incur a short-term capital loss. So, it's important to ensure that there are enough factors -- such as sound fundamentals, positive earnings estimate revisions, etc. -- that could keep the momentum in the stock going. Investors looking to make a profit from stocks that are currently on the move may find our \"Recent Price Strength\" screen pretty useful. This predefined screen comes handy in spotting stocks that are on an uptrend backed by strength in their fundamentals, and trading in the upper portion of their 52-week high-low range, which is usually an indicator of bullishness. DXP Enterprises (DXPE) is one of the several suitable candidates that passed through the screen. Here are the key reasons why it could be a profitable bet for \"trend\" investors. A solid price increase over a period of 12 weeks reflects investors' continued willingness to pay more for the potential upside in a stock. DXPE is quite a good fit in this regard, gaining 118.1% over this period. However, it's not enough to look at the price change for around three months, as it doesn't reflect any trend reversal that might have happened in a shorter time frame. It's important for a potential winner to maintain the price trend. A price increase of 28.5% over the past four weeks ensures that the trend is still in place for the stock of this industrial products supplier. Moreover, DXPE is currently trading at 100% of its 52-week High-Low Range, hinting that it can be on the verge of a breakout. Looking at the fundamentals, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises -- the key factors that impact a stock's near-term price movements. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> Story Continues Another factor that confirms the company's fundamental strength is its Average Broker Recommendation of #1 (Strong Buy). This indicates that the brokerage community is highly optimistic about the stock's near-term price performance. So, the price trend in DXPE may not reverse anytime soon. In addition to DXPE, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our \"Recent Price Strength\" screen.

DXPE, Photronics, Inc. PLAB, GigaCloud Technology Inc. GCT and Mission Produce, Inc. AVO. Look Beyond Profit: Bet on 4 Stocks with Increasing Cash Flows Crunching profit numbers and evaluating surprises might appear as a good option in the ongoing reporting cycle but these do not ensure that the profits are being efficiently channeled to the reserves for funding growth. This is because even a profit-making company can have a deficiency of cash flow and go bankrupt while meeting its obligations. Therefore, one must look at a company's proficiency in generating cash flows before investing in the right stocks. This is because cash is the most indispensable factor for any company. It gives strength and vitality and is the key to its existence, development and success. This view is particularly relevant in light of the ongoing global economic uncertainty, coupled with market disruptions and dislocations. In this regard, stocks like DXP Enterprises, Inc. , Photronics, Inc. , GigaCloud Technology Inc. and Mission Produce, Inc. are worth buying. To figure out this efficiency, one needs to consider a company's net cash flow. While in any business, cash moves in and out, it is net cash flow that explains how much money a company is actually generating. If a company is experiencing a positive cash flow, it denotes an increase in its liquid assets, which gives it the means to meet debt obligations, shell out for expenses, reinvest in the business, endure downturns and finally return wealth to shareholders. On the other hand, a negative cash flow indicates a decline in the company's liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves. However, having a positive cash flow merely does not secure a company's future growth. To ride on the growth curve, a company must have its cash flow increasing because that indicates management's efficiency in regulating its cash movements and less dependency on outside financing for running its business. Therefore, keep yourself abreast with the following screen to bet on stocks with rising cash flows. Here are four out of the 11 stocks that qualified for the screening: DXP Enterprises provides innovative pumping solutions, supply-chain services, and maintenance, repair, operating and production services.

{"text": "Look Beyond Profit, Bet on 4 Stocks With Increasing Cash Flows Moumita C. Chattopadhyay Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 4:58 PM 5 min read In This Article: DXPE -3.10% Crunching profit numbers and evaluating surprises might appear as a good option in the ongoing reporting cycle but these do not ensure that the profits are being efficiently channeled to the reserves for funding growth. This is because even a profit-making company can have a deficiency of cash flow and go bankrupt while meeting its obligations. Therefore, one must look at a company\u2019s proficiency in generating cash flows before investing in the right stocks. This is because cash is the most indispensable factor for any company. It gives strength and vitality and is the key to its existence, development and success. This view is particularly relevant in light of the ongoing global economic uncertainty, coupled with market disruptions and dislocations. In this regard, stocks like DXP Enterprises, Inc. DXPE, Photronics, Inc. PLAB, GigaCloud Technology Inc. GCT and Mission Produce, Inc. AVO are worth buying. To figure out this efficiency, one needs to consider a company\u2019s net cash flow. While in any business, cash moves in and out, it is net cash flow that explains how much money a company is actually generating. If a company is experiencing a positive cash flow, it denotes an increase in its liquid assets, which gives it the means to meet debt obligations, shell out for expenses, reinvest in the business, endure downturns and finally return wealth to shareholders. On the other hand, a negative cash flow indicates a decline in the company\u2019s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves. However, having a positive cash flow merely does not secure a company\u2019s future growth. To ride on the growth curve, a company must have its cash flow increasing because that indicates management\u2019s efficiency in regulating its cash movements and less dependency on outside financing for running its business. Therefore, keep yourself abreast with the following screen to bet on stocks with rising cash flows. Screening Parameters: To find stocks that have seen increasing cash flow over time, we ran the screen for those whose cash flow in the latest reported quarter was at least equal to or greater than the 5-year average cash flow per common share . This implies a positive trend and increasing cash over a period of time. In addition to this, we chose: Zacks Rank 1: No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here . Average Broker Rating 1: This indicates that brokers are also highly hopeful about the company\u2019s future performance. Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This sieves out low-priced stocks. VGM Score of B or better: This score is also of great assistance in selecting stocks. Importantly, this scoring system helps in picking winning stocks in their industry categories. Here are four out of the 11 stocks that qualified for the screening: DXP Enterprises provides innovative pumping solutions, supply-chain services, and maintenance, repair, operating and production services.

Trading Near 52-Week High: Should You Buy the Stock? Avisekh  Bhattacharjee Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 6:42 PM 4 min read In This Article: DXPE -3.10% Shares of DXP Enterprises, Inc. DXPE have been showing impressive gains of late, trading close to its 52-week high of $103.61. The stock closed at $102.67 on Friday, 0.9% below the highest point. Shares of the maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) products distributor have surged 97.2% in the past six months, outpacing the Zacks sub-industry\u2019s and the S&P 500\u2019s growth of 3.4% and 8.2%, respectively. The company has also outperformed other industry players like Ingersoll Rand Inc. IR and Xylem Inc. XYL, which have lost 8.1% and 14.2%, respectively, over the said time frame. DXPE Outperforms Industry, S&P 500 & Peers Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The stock is trading above both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating solid upward momentum and price stability. This reflects a positive market sentiment and confidence in the company's financial health and long-term prospects. DXPE Shares Trading Above 50-Day and 200-Day SMA Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Factors Favoring the Company The strongest driver of DXP Enterprises\u2019 business at the moment is strength in its Service Centers segment, which grew approximately 8% year over year in third-quarter 2024. The segment has been benefiting from healthy demand for MRO products, equipment and integrated services, along with positive business mix and contributions from acquired assets. From a product perspective, strength in DXPE\u2019s U.S. safety services and metalworking product divisions and Canadian rotating equipment unit holds promise for its long-term growth. Solid momentum in the Innovative Pumping Solutions segment remains another growth catalyst for the company. Increased project-related work in the energy, water and wastewater treatment markets has been proving beneficial for the segment. Its performance has also been strengthened by an increase in prices from its vendors and suppliers along with the contributions from acquisitions. Driven by strength across end markets, the segment\u2019s revenues increased 52% in the third quarter of 2024. DXP Enterprises has booked a few large projects in both energy and water end markets, from which it expects to recognize revenues starting from the first quarter of 2025. That said, the company\u2019s focus on executing its current backlog and planning for modest volume growth across energy, biofuels, food and beverage and water and wastewater markets should drive its long-term growth. Management also remains focused on acquiring businesses to gain access to new customers, regions and product lines. For instance, in November 2024, DXPE completed the acquisitions of Burt Gurney & Associates (\u201cBGA\u201d) and MaxVac Inc. The inclusion of BGA expanded the reach of DXPE\u2019s Water division into new geographic territory while MaxVac enhanced its vacuum pump capabilities. Acquisitions had a contribution of 6% to the company\u2019s sales in the third quarter. Also, the company\u2019s focus on operational executions, supply-chain optimization and marketing activities is likely to boost its performance. Story Continues Earnings Estimate Revision The Zacks Consensus Estimate for DXP Enterprises\u2019 2025 earnings has increased 11.7% to $4.31 per share over the past 60 days, indicating year-over-year growth of 5.9%. Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar . Stock Valuation Despite the positives, DXPE\u2019s lofty valuation remains a concern. The stock is trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.82X, higher than the industry average of 21.49X. Also, it is overvalued compared with its peer, Flowserve Corporation FLS, which is trading at 19.62X. This elevated valuation could make the stock vulnerable to further pullbacks if market sentiment sours. Price-to-Earnings (Forward 12 Months) Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Our Final Take Robust momentum across safety services, metalworking products and rotating equipment businesses, along with strength in energy and wastewater treatment markets, positions DXP Enterprises favorably for impressive growth in the quarters ahead. Given the strength across most of its served markets, DXPE has built a healthy backlog level that should support its top-line performance. Despite its expensive valuation, positive analyst sentiment and robust growth prospects indicate it is the right time for potential investors to bet on this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company.

Surges 38% in a Year: Is It Still Good Time to Buy? Zacks Equity Research Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 4:56 PM 6 min read In This Article: NTAP -1.95% NetApp \u2019s NTAP shares have proven resilient, with a 37.8% gain in the past year, outpacing the industry\u2019s growth of 10.7%. NetApp provides enterprise storage as well as data management software and hardware products and services. It has also outperformed the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500 composite\u2019s growth of 27.8% and 24.8%, respectively. Closing at $122.09 in the last trading session, NTAP stock is currently trading 9.9% below its 52-week high of $135.45, attained on Nov. 22, 2024. Price Performance Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research With the pullback from 52-week high along with strong business momentum, is NTAP an attractive investment opportunity? Let us discuss NTAP\u2019s prospects and ascertain how to strategize investment. NTAP\u2019s Flash & Public Cloud Business Key Drivers NetApp is witnessing higher demand from customers for its portfolio of modern all-flash arrays, especially the C-series capacity flash and ASA block-optimized flash. The new all-flash A-series is also picking up momentum. These enterprise storage products will allow users to boost workloads including traditional enterprise applications and Gen AI. The company expects the new AFF A-series, along with its C-series and ASA products, to capture further share in the all-flash market. In the fiscal second quarter, the company\u2019s All-Flash Array Business\u2019s annualized net revenue run rate was $3.8 billion, up 19% year over year. Total billings rose 9% year over year to $1.59 billion. Also, Keystone\u2019s storage-as-a-service offering has been gaining significant traction, with revenues increasing more than 55% year over year in the fiscal second quarter. Unbilled RPO was $330 million, up 11% quarter over quarter. Unbilled RPO is a key indicator of Keystone's growth. Solid momentum in hyperscaler first-party and marketplace storage services has been driving revenues from the Public Cloud. The Public Cloud segment comprises revenues from products delivered as a service and related supports. The portfolio contains cloud automation and optimization services, storage and cloud infrastructure monitoring services. Public Cloud segment\u2019s revenues improved 9% to $168 million, driven by 43% increase in first-party and marketplace cloud storage services. Driven by strength in the cloud storage business, NetApp now expects cloud revenues to return to double-digit growth year over year from the current quarter. NTAP Raises Outlook Driven by strong year-to-date performance and strength in flash, block, cloud and AI, NetApp now expects full-year revenues in the range of $6.54-$6.74 billion, up 6% year over year at the mid-point. Earlier it anticipated sales in the band of $6.48-$6.68 billion. The company now forecasts non-GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2025 to be between $7.20 and $7.40, up 13% year over year at the mid-point. Earlier, it expected non-GAAP earnings between $7 and $7.20 per share. For fiscal 2025, NetApp continues to expect non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 71-72%. Non-GAAP operating margin is anticipated in the band of 28-28.5% compared with 27-28%. NetApp recently inked a definitive agreement to divest its Spot by NetApp FinOps business to Flexera, a global technology spend and risk management player. NetApp acquired cloud services startup \u2013\u2013 Spot \u2013\u2013 in July 2020.\u00a0 The divesture aligns seamlessly with NetApp\u2019s vision of fostering long-term growth and innovation in the intelligent data infrastructure. While the financial details of the transaction remain undisclosed, the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Story Continues AI Momentum Long-term Growth Driver for NTAP Apart from the demand for flash and block, increasing demand for NetApp\u2019s cloud storage and AI solutions bodes well. In the fiscal second quarter, the company won more than 100 AI and data lake modernization deals. The company is also working on the development of GenAI cloud and on-premises solutions in collaboration with industry behemoths. NetApp expanded its partnership with Google Cloud to provide the foundational data storage for the Google Distributed Cloud and make AI-ready infrastructure available to the public sector and other highly regulated industries. NetApp's intelligent data infrastructure, bolstered by ONTAP and StorageGRID solutions, empowers its customers to efficiently scale workloads and harness AI while ensuring security and regulatory compliance. Google Distributed Cloud will also use these capabilities to enhance its services, including databases, AI and analytics. NTAP\u2019s Healthy Capital Allocation Strategy Management\u2019s execution has been favorable in recent times. NetApp\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and investments was $2.22 billion while long-term debt was $1.244 billion as of Oct. 25, 2024. For the fiscal second quarter, the company generated net cash from operations was $105 million and free cash flow was $60 million. Net cash balance provides the required flexibility to pursue any growth strategy, whether through acquisitions or otherwise. A strong balance sheet helps NetApp to continue its shareholder-friendly initiatives of dividend payouts. The company returned $406 million to its shareholders as dividend payouts and share repurchases in the last reported quarter. The company has $800 million worth of shares remaining under its existing authorization. NetApp also announced a dividend of 52 cents per share payable on Jan. 22, 2025, to its shareholders of record as of the close of business on Jan. 3.
