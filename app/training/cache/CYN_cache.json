PM 4 min read In This Article: CYN -56.70% MENLO PARK, Calif. , Jan. 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Cyngn Inc. (Nasdaq: CYN) today announced that it has continued making notable inroads with the automotive manufacturing sector. To date, the company has conducted DriveMod Tugger deployments at varying stages of maturity with no less than five major automotive Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) or Tier-1 Suppliers. Cyngn Continues Momentum in Automotive Sector with Several DriveMod Tugger Deployments at Major Automotive Brands. This traction has led to deployments across the United States and into Mexico , underscoring Cyngn's ability to provide scalable, cross-functional automation in diverse environments. The announcement today builds upon announcements the company has made in recent months. In October, Cyngn announced two wins in this sector: on October 17th , the Company announced that it had signed a commercial contract with a major manufacturer in the automotive service equipment space; two weeks later, the company announced it had executed a letter of intent to sell multiple DriveMod Tuggers to a global Automotive Supplier. The Company also joined John Deere's supply base in April. \"These exciting milestones reflect a strategic and ongoing effort to target a sector that we know stands to derive value from our solutions,\" said Lior Tal , Cyngn CEO. \"Our DriveMod Tugger tows up to 12,000 pounds, which makes it an excellent solution to handle the high-uptime demands of moving heavy parts across automotive manufacturing floors.\" The manufacturing industry is facing a critical talent shortage , with over 620,000 job openings unfilled as of January 2024 and a potential gap of 2.1 million jobs by 2030 . Deloitte's projections further underscore this challenge, estimating that the industry will need around 3.8 million new employees between 2024 and 2033 to keep up with demand. To bridge this workforce gap, leaders are demonstrating a growing need and willingness to invest in automation, with 90% recognizing it as vital to future success. However, only 9% of manufacturers have currently implemented autonomous technologies, leaving substantial room for growth as companies realize the efficiency gains and cost reductions that these innovations offer. About\u00a0Cyngn Cyngn develops and deploys scalable, differentiated autonomous vehicle technology for industrial organizations. Cyngn's self-driving solutions allow existing workforces to increase productivity and efficiency. The Company addresses significant challenges facing industrial organizations today, such as labor shortages, costly safety incidents, and increased consumer demand for eCommerce. Story Continues Cyngn's DriveMod Kit can be installed on new industrial vehicles at end of line or via retrofit, empowering customers to seamlessly adopt self-driving technology into their operations without high upfront costs or the need to completely replace existing vehicle investments. Cyngn's flagship product, its Enterprise Autonomy Suite, includes DriveMod (autonomous vehicle system), Cyngn Insight (customer-facing suite of AV fleet management, teleoperation, and analytics tools), and Cyngn Evolve (internal toolkit that enables Cyngn to leverage data from the field for artificial intelligence, simulation, and modeling). For all terms referenced within, please refer to the Company's annual report on Form 10-K with the SEC filed on March 7, 2024 .

Meeting Business Wire Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 8:40 PM 9 min read In this article: HDVXF 0.00% BLGFF -2.99% 70HF.L 0.00% KPC.L -0.39% CYN.L -1.08% NEW YORK, January 22, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Saba Capital Management, L.P. (together with certain of its affiliates, \"Saba\" or \"we\") today issued the following statement regarding the announced outcome of Herald Investment Trust PLC\u2019s (HRI:LSE) (the \"Trust\") Requisitioned General Meeting on 22 January 2025. \"We appreciate the thoughtful engagement from fellow HRI shareholders in recent weeks, which only reinforces the dire state of the U.K. investment trust industry and need for Saba\u2019s presence in the market. Over a brief period, our campaign has already enhanced value for shareholders and incited positive change at HRI \u2013 and elsewhere in the U.K. market \u2013 as evidenced by discounts to net asset value narrowing and numerous trusts announcing shareholder-friendly actions. While these developments are encouraging, more change is required. As told in countless U.K. financial press articles over the past three years, the industry's failure to protect shareholders from losses due to poor performance and widening discounts cannot remain unaddressed. At HRI, we will continue to pursue the changes that we believe are necessary to improve the Trust after three years of poor returns and two decades of abysmal discount management by Katie Potts. Saba remains committed to putting shareholders\u2019 interests first, delivering returns for U.K. trust investors and ultimately rehabilitating this broken sector. We urge shareholders of the six other trusts at which we have requisitioned General Meetings to support Saba\u2019s resolutions in order to set these trusts on the path to meaningful value creation.\" *** As a reminder, Saba has requisitioned General Meetings of six other trusts (the \"Trusts\") to provide shareholders the opportunity to vote on resolutions to remove the Trusts\u2019 existing directors and appoint highly qualified directors to replace them. 1 Saba is convening the General Meetings because we believe the current boards and investment managers have failed to perform versus their benchmarks, resulting in deep trading discounts to net asset value, which we believe have only recently narrowed as a result of Saba\u2019s investment. These Trusts have scheduled their Requisitioned General Meetings for: USA: 3 February 2025 at 12p.m. GMT KPC: 3 February 2025 at 12p.m. GMT CYN: 4 February 2025 at 11a.m. GMT HOT: 4 February 2025 at 10a.m. GMT ESCT: 5 February 2025 at 12:30p.m. GMT EWI: 14 February 2025 at 11:45a.m. GMT Note: The voting deadlines for each Trust will be earlier than the dates of the General Meetings.

Management, L.P. (together with certain of its affiliates, \"Saba\" or \"we\"), today issued a presentation outlining its plan to deliver shareholder value at seven U.K. investment trusts: Baillie Gifford US Growth Trust PLC (USA:LSE), CQS Natural Resources Growth & Income PLC (CYN:LSE), Edinburgh Worldwide Investment Trust PLC (EWI:LSE), European Smaller Companies Trust PLC (ESCT:LSE), Henderson Opportunities Trust PLC (HOT:LSE), Herald Investment Trust PLC (HRI:LSE) and Keystone Positive Change Investment Trust PLC (KPC:LSE) (collectively, the \"Trusts\"). The presentation can be viewed here . *** As a reminder, Saba has requisitioned General Meetings of these seven Trusts to provide shareholders the opportunity to vote on resolutions to remove the Trusts\u2019 existing directors and appoint highly qualified directors to replace them. 1 Saba is convening the General Meetings because we believe the current Boards and investment managers have failed to perform versus their benchmarks, resulting in deep trading discounts to net asset value, which we believe have only recently narrowed as a result of Saba\u2019s investment. Six of the seven Trusts have scheduled their Requisitioned General Meetings: HRI: 22 January 2025 at 12p.m. GMT USA: 3 February 2025 at 12p.m. GMT KPC: 3 February 2025 at 12p.m. GMT CYN: 4 February 2025 at 11a.m. GMT HOT: 4 February 2025 at 10a.m. GMT ESCT: 5 February 2025 at 12:30p.m. GMT Note: The voting deadlines for each Trust will be earlier than the dates of the General Meetings.

Resolutions at Each Trust NEW YORK, January 13, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Saba Capital Management, L.P. (together with certain of its affiliates, \"Saba\" or \"we\"), today addressed the misleading claims made recently by Baillie Gifford US Growth Trust PLC (USA:LSE), CQS Natural Resources Growth & Income PLC (CYN:LSE), Edinburgh Worldwide Investment Trust PLC (EWI:LSE), European Smaller Companies Trust PLC (ESCT:LSE), Henderson Opportunities Trust PLC (HOT:LSE), Herald Investment Trust PLC (HRI:LSE) and Keystone Positive Change Investment Trust PLC (KPC:LSE) (collectively, the \"Trusts\") with key facts that reinforce the need for shareholder-driven change. As a reminder, Saba has requisitioned General Meetings of these seven Trusts to provide shareholders the opportunity to vote on resolutions to remove the Trusts\u2019 existing directors and appoint highly qualified directors to replace them. 1 Saba is convening the General Meetings because we believe the current Boards of Directors (the \"Boards\") and investment managers have failed to perform versus their benchmarks, resulting in deep trading discounts to net asset value (\"NAV\"), which we believe have only recently narrowed as a result of Saba\u2019s investment. Saba Founder and CIO Boaz Weinstein will be hosting a live webinar on Tuesday, 14 January at 1:00 p.m. GMT to explain why the Boards must be replaced immediately, outline Saba\u2019s strategy to deliver substantial liquidity and long-term returns for all shareholders and take questions from the audience. To access the webinar, visit: www.bit.ly/saba-uk-webinar . Misleading Claims from the Trusts Regarding Saba\u2019s Campaign The Facts \"Saba\u2019s motives are self-serving and will not benefit all shareholders.\" Link As the largest investor in each Trust, our interests are directly aligned with those of all shareholders. We have a proven track record of pursuing changes that return discounted funds to their full NAV and create long-term value for all shareholders. If Saba were selected as manager, our strategy of buying undervalued trusts would accrue to the benefit of the very industry (and shareholders) that managers are claiming we would hurt. \"Saba wishes to take control of your Company for its own economic benefit rather than due to concerns about the Company's performance.\" Link Saba\u2019s investment and engagement in the U.K. investment trust industry is already driving positive results for shareholders. The Trusts\u2019 discounts to NAV have narrowed significantly over the last six months, which we believe is due to Saba\u2019s buying. Only after direct pressure from Saba and through growing our holdings have the majority of the Trusts taken shareholder-friendly actions \u2013 including offering full cash exits, increased buybacks and tender offers. \"Saba has not offered a plan for the benefit of all Shareholders.\" Link As disclosed in our 18 December letter , Saba\u2019s plan is simple : with a reconstituted Board, we intend to provide shareholders with liquidity options plus the opportunity for greater long-term returns under a new investment strategy and manager. For HRI shareholders, Saba announced its intent to encourage the new Board to offer a full cash exit at 99% of NAV if shareholders support Saba\u2019s resolutions to reconstitute the HRI Board. \"Saba brings uncertainty and risk.\" Link We\u2019re giving shareholders the chance to get out of an underperforming Trust if they so desire. If they want to remain invested, we\u2019re providing shareholders with the opportunity to profit from this sector rather than be a casualty of it. If Saba is selected as manager, our plan is to offer a U.K.-listed product that will mainly buy trusts at discounts and encourage management to take action, so investors can profit. We intend to use the same proven investment process as the Saba Capital Closed-End Funds ETF (\"CEFS\"), which invests in discounted U.S. closed-end funds, to the extent shareholders agree. Material changes to the investment policy would require the approval of the relevant Trust\u2019s shareholders. \"Saba wants to appoint a non-independent board.\" Link Saba has put forth independent director candidates across the seven Trusts. All nominees other than Paul Kazarian and Boaz Weinstein are independent from Saba, meaning half of the Board of each Trust will be independent if our proposed resolutions are passed. To ensure compliance with the highest standards of governance, our nominees intend to add one or more additional independent directors to each Board as soon as reasonably possible following the Trusts\u2019 General Meetings. \"The new Board would not meet the standards of both the UK Corporate Governance Code and AIC Code of Corporate Governance.\" Link If Saba\u2019s nominees are elected, the Board of each Trust will be legally compliant at all times under the FCA Listing Rules and will ensure compliance with the highest standards of governance. Following the General Meetings, each Board will comply with the AIC Code of Corporate Governance as soon as practicable, as the nominees intend to appoint one or more additional independent directors with suitable experience. \"We believe Saba\u2019s plan [\u2026] may introduce substantially inflated fees.\" Link This is a fear-mongering tactic being peddled by numerous managers to distract from poor performance. Saba\u2019s U.K. investment trust strategy \u2013 like its closed-end fund strategy in the U.S. \u2013 is anchored in protecting shareholder rights by: Pursuing changes that return discounted trusts to their full NAV. Creating long-term value for shareholders through low fees and better management . Saba maintains a highly competitive 1.1% management fee for CEFS. The fund has experienced substantial demand from investors, allowing it to issue new shares every year since its 2017 launch. 2 Misleading Claims from Herald The Facts \"Since launch in 1994, Herald Investment Trust's investment strategy has delivered outstanding investment performance.\" Link HRI significantly underperformed its benchmark this past year and the past three years, despite beginning 2024 with its largest position in Super Micro Computer \u2013 a company that experienced a huge surge, rising more than 300%. 3 This underperformance is attributed to Katie Potts\u2019s mismanagement of both the Super Micro Computer position and the overall portfolio. \"The Board reiterates its belief that, since Saba started investing in 2009, it has materially underperformed Herald.\" Link This is a complete fabrication: Saba\u2019s public funds did not start investing in 2009. Saba\u2019s CEFS inception was in 2017, and Saba only became the manager of its two closed-end funds in 2023 and 2021. There is no way to compare performance to HRI since 2009. In stark contrast to CEFS delivering a 46.0% gain over the last three years, HRI posted a 9.7% NAV loss. 4 \"If Saba gains control [\u2026] significant value could be lost for Shareholders as a result of forced selling of parts of [HRI\u2019s] Portfolio.\" Link Given our 25.5% ownership of HRI (compared to the current Board holding under 0.05%), it is illogical to suggest that Saba would favour a fire sale that undervalues the very assets in which we are the single largest shareholder. Misleading Claims from Baillie Gifford The Facts \"The Keystone board accepts that the company has been through a challenging period of performance against a difficult backdrop and has already taken steps to address this and provide certainty and options for all shareholders [\u2026]\" Link Since Baillie Gifford took over KPC four years ago, performance has been abysmal. The Board\u2019s own benchmark is up 38.3%, while KPC\u2019s NAV return is at -26.1%. 5 KPC Chair Karen Brade has overseen cumulative underperformance of nearly 130% since assuming her role in 2018 \u2013 a staggering loss and destruction of wealth for retail holders and retirees. 6 \"[USA] is successfully delivering on its investment mandate, with strong long-term performance, and it provides Shareholders with access to leading private companies of this generation, such as SpaceX, Databricks and Stripe, at low cost.\" Link We consider Saba\u2019s buying to be the key driver of today\u2019s premium at USA. Without our buying, USA (and EWI) would continue to trade at discounts \u2013 just like they did previously. Baillie Gifford\u2019s Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust (SMT:LSE) and Schiehallion Fund (MNTN:LSE) have similar positions in private companies like SpaceX, yet they trade at double-digit discounts. Misleading Claims from Janus Henderson The Facts \"ESCT is a well-managed investment company whose strategy has delivered long-term outperformance for you.\" Link Over the last three years, Janus Henderson\u2019s ESCT and HOT have both traded at a disappointing ~-13.5% average discount to NAV. 7 These respective double-digit discounts demonstrate that the Trusts\u2019 Boards and portfolio managers have failed shareholders. \"The Board of HOT is offering you a full cash exit at NAV and/or the option to rollover into an open-ended vehicle managed by Janus Henderson Investors. These opportunities are at risk of being cancelled by Saba.\" Link This scheme is simply a last-ditch attempt to protect the underperforming Board, continue lining the manager\u2019s own pockets with shareholder capital and distract from an indefensible track record. We believe Janus Henderson\u2019s proposed reconstruction scheme for HOT is inferior to our nominees\u2019 plan, which will deliver substantial liquidity and long-term returns. Misleading Claims from Manulife | CQS The Facts \"Your Board has overseen strong performance.\" Link CYN Chair Christopher Casey cannot hide from poor performance. At CYN, he \"delivered\" a -14% discount for shareholders and -30% underperformance versus its benchmark over the past three years. 8 Six of the seven Trusts have scheduled their Requisitioned General Meetings: H RI: 22 January 2025 at 12p.m. GMT USA: 3 February 2025 at 12p.m. GMT KPC: 3 February 2025 at 12p.m. GMT CYN: 4 February 2025 at 11a.m. GMT HOT: 4 February 2025 at 10a.m. GMT ESCT: 5 February 2025 at 12:30p.m. GMT Note: The voting deadlines for each Trust will be earlier than the dates of the General Meetings.

Long-Overdue, Full Liquidity in Response to HRI Shareholder Feedback Announces Webinar on 14 January at 1PM GMT Where Saba\u2019s Founder & CIO Boaz Weinstein Will Detail Plan to Deliver Shareholder Value at HRI and the Six Additional Trusts \u2013 Register Here: www.bit.ly/saba-uk-webinar NEW YORK, January 09, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Saba Capital Management, L.P. (together with certain of its affiliates, \"Saba\" or \"we\"), today issued the following statement regarding its support for an offer to shareholders of Herald Investment Trust PLC (HRI:LSE) (\"HRI\" or the \"Trust\") of a full cash exit near net asset value (\"NAV\"), overseen by a fully independent Board, if Saba\u2019s efforts to reconstitute the Board of Directors (\"the Board\") are successful: \"If shareholders support Saba\u2019s resolutions to reconstitute the HRI Board, Saba would encourage the new Board to offer all shareholders a 100% cash exit at 99% of the Trust\u2019s NAV. As a result, Saba expects that shareholders will have the opportunity to sell their entire position at 99% of NAV, if they wish. In addition, Saba would support further changes so this cash exit would be overseen by a fully independent Board and would not expect it to occur for at least a year thereafter, ensuring portfolio value is maximized. These new commitments come in response to feedback from shareholders, who have suffered a -14.7% three-year average discount to NAV, and provide certainty regarding the plan to deliver long-overdue liquidity to all shareholders, alongside the opportunity for greater long-term returns under a new investment strategy and manager.\" 1 *** As a reminder, Saba has requisitioned General Meetings of seven Trusts to provide shareholders the opportunity to vote on resolutions to remove the Trusts\u2019 existing directors and appoint highly qualified directors to replace them. 2,3 Saba is convening the General Meetings because we believe the current Boards and investment managers have failed to perform versus their benchmarks and have, therefore, required Saba\u2019s investment to narrow the deep trading discounts to NAV and deliver returns for shareholders.

(together with certain of its affiliates, \"Saba\" or \"we\"), which owns approximately 20.9% of Herald Investment Trust PLC (HRI:LSE) (\"HRI\" or the \"Trust\"), today issued the following statement from Founder and Chief Investment Officer Boaz Weinstein regarding misleading statements included in HRI\u2019s Circular for the Requisitioned General Meeting that is scheduled for 22 January 2025: \"While Katie Potts has delivered strong returns over most of her three-decade tenure managing HRI, we\u2019re now in 2025 and the Board must be held accountable for the Trust\u2019s exceptionally poor returns during the last three years. Despite HRI beginning 2024 with its largest position in Super Micro Computer \u2013 a company that experienced a huge surge, rising more than 300% \u2013 the Trust significantly underperformed its benchmark. This underperformance is attributed to Ms. Potts\u2019s mismanagement of both the Super Micro Computer position and the overall portfolio. In stark contrast to the Saba Closed-End Funds ETF (\"CEFS\") 1 delivering a 46.0% gain over the last three years, 2 HRI posted a 9.7% NAV loss. It is therefore unsurprising that HRI has resorted to baseless attacks on Saba\u2019s track record as well as inaccurate claims about our nominees\u2019 independence and their plans to deliver substantial liquidity and stronger long-term returns. The reality is that CEFS has outperformed HRI over every relevant time period since its launch in 2017. Given our 20.9% ownership of HRI (compared to the current Board holding under 0.05%), it is absurd to suggest that we would favour a fire-sale of the very assets in which we are the single-largest shareholder. We fear the recent progress made on the narrowing of the discount will be reversed if shareholders do not support Saba\u2019s campaign to reconstitute the Board with new directors who will truly mind the gap.\" Net Asset Value (\"NAV\") Return Ticker CEFS Inception (21 March 2017) 5-Year 3-Year 1-Year HRI 123.0% 48.5% -9.7% 19.7% CEFS 128.7% 79.1% 46.0% 28.8% Source: Bloomberg. Data as of market close on 13 December 2024, prior to the launch of Saba\u2019s campaign to deliver value to shareholders of seven investment trusts (the \"Trusts\"). *** As a reminder, Saba has requisitioned General Meetings of seven Trusts to provide shareholders the opportunity to vote on resolutions to remove the Trusts\u2019 existing directors and appoint highly qualified directors to replace them. 3,4 Saba is convening the General Meetings because we believe the current Boards of Directors and investment managers have failed to perform versus their benchmarks and have, therefore, required Saba\u2019s investment to narrow the deep trading discounts to NAV and deliver returns for shareholders.
