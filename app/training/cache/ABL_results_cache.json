[{"text": "First Bank Announces Fourth Quarter 2024 Net Income of $10.5 Million and Full Year Net Income of $42.2 Million First Bank Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 12:35 AM 32 min read In This Article: FRBA -1.45% First Bank Results highlighted by strong loan growth, continued operating efficiency, and solid asset quality HAMILTON, N.J., Jan. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Bank (Nasdaq Global Market: FRBA) (\"the Bank\") today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $10.5\u00a0million, or $0.41 per diluted share, compared to $8.4 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2023. Return on average assets, return on average equity\u00a0and return on average tangible equity i for the fourth quarter of 2024 were 1.10%, 10.27% and 11.82%, respectively, compared to 0.93%, 9.06% and 10.67%, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2023. Full year 2024 net income was $42.2 million, or $1.67 per diluted share, compared to $20.9 million, or $0.95 per diluted share for 2023. Return on average assets, return on average equity\u00a0and return on average tangible equity i for the full year 2024 were 1.15%, 10.77% and 12.50%, respectively, compared to 0.66%, 6.38% and 7.17%, respectively, for the full year 2023. Financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 included the impact of merger-related expenses and other one-time\u00a0items that were primarily related to the Malvern Bancorp acquisition, completed in July 2023. See the analysis of the Bank's adjusted net income in the attached financial tables, which include a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measure. Fourth Quarter 2024 Performance Highlights: Total loans of $3.14 billion at December 31, 2024 grew $56.8 million, or 7.3%, annualized, from the linked quarter ended September 30, 2024. Total deposits were $3.06 billion at December 31, 2024, increasing $5.8 million from the linked quarter ended September 30, 2024. Tangible book value per share ii grew to $14.19 at December 31, 2024, increasing 10.0%, annualized, from $13.84 at September 30, 2024. Total net revenue (net interest income plus non-interest income) of $33.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 increased $5.8 million, or 20.6%, compared to the prior year quarter, while full year total net revenue was $129.9 million, an increase of $26.1 million, or 25.1%, compared to 2023. Strong asset quality continued, with nonperforming assets decreasing to 0.46% of total assets at December 31, 2024, compared to 0.47% at September 30, 2024 and 0.69% at December 31, 2023. Patrick L. Ryan, President and CEO of First Bank, reflected on the Bank\u2019s performance, stating, \u201cWe had a great finish to a very strong year. Our community banking and specialty banking teams produced strong loan growth during the quarter, with solid pipelines going into 2025. We are especially pleased to have achieved this with continued strength in asset quality and with sustained efficiency. Our efficiency ratio remained below 60% for the 22 nd consecutive quarter, even as we invested in technology and new C&I and deposit-focused business units. We have a clear vision for our future success \u2013 continued evolution from a traditional community bank into a full-service, middle market commercial bank. We are building from the core with our great commercially-focused, community bankers and our proven CRE lending teams. From that strong core we have layered in several exciting new initiatives that are all gaining momentum and moving closer to scale. With our Banking as a Service (\u201cBaaS\u201d) initiative launching this year, and our Asset Based Lending (\u201cABL\u201d), Private Equity (\u201cPE\u201d) and Small Business teams all growing nicely, we\u2019re excited for 2025 and beyond.\u201d Story Continues Ryan continued, \u201cFirst Bank is a unique and exciting investment opportunity where shareholders can own both an established franchise generating strong financial performance today with real opportunities for even stronger performance moving forward as the new business units grow and bear fruit. Furthermore, prudent interest rate management and incremental balance sheet repositioning during 2024 leave us well positioned to thrive in 2025 as we can generate strong profitability in various interest rate environments.\u201d Mr. Ryan added, \u201cIn 2025, to help drive continued core deposit growth, we are expanding our community banking network, with recent branch openings in Trenton, NJ and Media, PA, making First Bank even more accessible for our customers. Ongoing upgrades to our online banking platform will further enhance the digital customer\u2019s experience. We\u2019re also rolling out new technology and tools to enhance our sales culture. These investments will support our strong team of bankers in their efforts to add quality deposit relationships, expand our newer specialty banking teams, and maintain excellent asset quality. We believe we are well-positioned to achieve our profitability and growth goals in 2025. We are proud of our track record of delivering top-quartile performance while still making significant and important investments in the future.\u201d Mr. Ryan concluded, \u201cIn December, the Kroll Bond Rating Agency (\"KBRA\") again affirmed our investment grade credit ratings. Their press release cited our successful execution of strategy in recent years, including a demonstrated ability to effectively integrate acquisitions and to effectively navigate the interest rate hiking cycle. KBRA remarked the Bank\u2019s focus on building a stronger core deposit base has been notable, and profitability has compared favorably to peers. We believe KBRA\u2019s report is another validation of our approach to building franchise value for our shareholders.\u201d Income Statement In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Bank\u2019s net interest income increased to $31.6 million, growing $595,000, or 1.9%, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of $3.7 million in interest income\u00a0which outpaced the $3.1 million increase in interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter in 2023. Net interest income increased $1.5 million, or 5.0%, over the linked third quarter of 2024. Growth was primarily driven by a $627,000 increase in interest income on loans, due to higher average loan volume, and by decreases of $641,000 and $185,000 in interest expense on deposits and borrowings, respectively, which resulted from lower average rates in the fourth quarter. Full year 2024 net interest income totaled $122.5 million, an increase of $18.0 million, or 17.3%, compared to $104.5 million for 2023. The increase was primarily a result of higher interest income from loans due to substantial loan growth related to the Malvern acquisition in the third quarter of 2023, organic loan growth in 2024, and higher loan yields. This was partially offset by increased interest expense due to an expanded deposit base related to the Malvern acquisition and organic growth, as well as the higher cost of deposits in 2024. Interest and dividend income increased by $48.1 million, reflecting growth in average loans, which increased by $325.5 million, or 12.1%, from the prior year, and a 74 basis point increase in the average yield on loans. The average cost of total interest bearing deposits increased 72\u00a0basis points compared to the prior year, reflective of the higher interest rate environment and ongoing competition for deposits throughout 2024. The average cost of time, money market, savings, and interest bearing demand deposits increased 127, 53, 51, and 43 basis points, respectively. The Bank\u2019s tax equivalent net interest margin measured 3.54% for the fourth quarter of 2024, decreasing by 14 basis points from 3.68% for the prior year quarter, and increasing by six basis points from 3.48% for the third quarter of 2024. The decrease from the prior year quarter was primarily driven by higher average rates on deposits. The Bank\u2019s net interest margin increased compared to the linked third quarter primarily due to declines in average rates on deposits and borrowings which outpaced the reduction in average rates on earning assets. The Bank\u2019s tax equivalent net interest margin includes the impact of amortization and accretion of premiums and discounts from fair value measurements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions. The net impact of amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts from fair value measurements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions was $3.1\u00a0million during the fourth quarter of 2024,\u00a0compared to $3.9\u00a0million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 and $3.4 million for the third quarter of 2024. The full year 2024 tax equivalent net interest margin was 3.57%, an increase of 10 basis points compared to 3.47% for the full year 2023. The increase was principally a result of a 70 basis point increase in the yield on interest earning assets, partially offset by a 66 basis point increase in interest bearing liabilities cost. The Bank recorded a credit loss expense totaling $234,000 during the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to a credit loss benefit totaling $294,000 for the same period of the previous year and a $1.6 million credit loss expense for the third quarter of 2024. The credit loss expense for the fourth quarter of 2024 reflects the Bank\u2019s organic loan growth. Credit loss expense\u00a0was muted by the net recoveries during the quarter and the Banks\u2019s strong and stable asset quality, while the credit loss benefit during the prior year quarter was primarily due to flat loan growth during the quarter. The Bank\u2019s credit loss expense for the third quarter of 2024 was commensurate with robust organic loan growth during the quarter. For the full year 2024, the Bank reported a credit loss expense of $1.2 million, compared to $7.9 million for 2023. Full year 2023 credit loss expense included a $5.5 million credit loss recorded to establish a reserve for acquired Malvern loans in 2023. The decrease in credit loss expense reflects a lower level of net charge-offs and\u00a0strong credit quality metrics when compared to 2023.\u00a0Net charge-offs for 2024 totaled\u00a0$205,000, excluding $5.5 million in a PCD loan charge-off in the first quarter of 2024, which was reserved for through purchase accounting marks at the time of the Malvern acquisition, compared to net charge-offs of $1.5 million in 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Bank recorded non-interest income totaling $2.2 million, compared to non-interest income measuring $(3.0) million during the same period in 2023 and $2.5 million in non-interest income during the third quarter of 2024. Results for the fourth quarter of 2023 included $4.7 million in combined losses on the sale of investments and loans. The losses were primarily related to the Bank\u2019s balance sheet repositioning, which primarily included the sale of lower-yielding residential loans and investment securities acquired from Malvern Bank during the third quarter of 2023. For the full year ended December 31, 2024, the Bank recorded non-interest income totaling $7.3 million compared to $(715,000) in non-interest income earned for the full year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the net losses realized on the sale of loans and investments related to balance sheet repositioning initiatives in 2023, in addition to the increased bank-owned life insurance income (\u201cBOIL\u201d) restructuring benefit\u00a0and higher levels of customer activity in 2024 following the July 2023 Malvern acquisition. Non-interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $19.1 million, an increase of $1.2 million, or 6.6%, compared to $17.9 million for the prior year quarter. Higher non-interest expense was largely due to increases of $1.5 million in salaries and employee benefits primarily due to a larger employee base, $265,000 in occupancy and equipment primarily due to new branch openings, and $159,000 in other professional fees and consulting services. This was partially offset by merger-related expenses that declined by $338,000 due to no merger activity in 2024. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense increased $480,000 from $18.6 million for the third quarter of 2024. The linked quarter increase primarily reflects salaries and employee benefits costs increasing $337,000 due to a larger employee base and higher incentive compensation accrual, occupancy and equipment costs rising $182,000 due to branch relocation and opening activity, and other professional fees rising $208,000 primarily related to investments in technology and consulting services. This was partially offset by a decrease of $523,000 in other real estate owned (\"OREO\") expense due to a $362,000 impairment of an OREO asset recorded during the linked quarter, along with other related legal and real estate tax expenses. Non-interest expense for the full year 2024 totaled $73.5 million, an increase of $4.8 million, or 7.0%, compared to $68.7 million for 2023. The increase was primarily a result of salaries and employee benefits costs increasing $6.4 million due to a larger employee base, occupancy and equipment costs rising $1.3 million due to an expanded network of facilities, and other generalized increases related to both the addition of Malvern in the second half of 2023 and ongoing investments in technology, products, and business operations. This was partially offset by an $8.0 million decrease in merger-related costs. Income tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2024 was $3.9 million with an effective tax rate of 27.2%, compared to $2.0 million with an effective tax rate of 19.1% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $4.2 million with an effective tax rate of 33.9%. Both the third and fourth quarter of 2024 tax expense included additional tax related to the Bank\u2019s BOLI restructuring. Income tax expense for the full year ended December 31, 2024 was $12.9\u00a0million with an effective tax rate of 23.4%, compared to $6.3 million for the full year 2023 with an effective tax rate of 23.1%. The full year tax rate in 2024\u00a0also included the negative impact of the BOLI restructuring but was offset by certain other tax adjustments from the first half of 2024 that reduced tax expense, primarily related to the revaluation of the Bank\u2019s deferred tax assets due to the impact of the New Jersey Corporate Transit Fee. The New Jersey Corporate Transit Fee will result in an increased tax rate in future periods. We anticipate our future effective tax rate will be closer to 25-26%. Balance Sheet The Bank reported total assets of $3.78\u00a0billion as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $171.0 million, or 4.7%, from $3.61 billion at December 31, 2023. Total loans increased $122.8 million, or 4.1%, to $3.14 billion at December 31, 2024 compared to $3.02 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase primarily reflects strong organic loan growth recorded in the second half of 2024, partially offset by sales of loans and investment securities totaling approximately $35.3 million during 2024. The Bank\u2019s cash and cash equivalents increased by $44.0 million, or 19.3%, compared to December 31, 2023, to ensure adequate on-balance sheet liquidity. Total assets increased $22.7 million, or 0.6%, from September 30, 2024 to December 31, 2024. Total loans as of December 31, 2024 increased $56.8 million, or 1.8%, from $3.09 billion at September 30, 2024.\u00a0Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $40.4\u00a0million, or 12.9%, compared to September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, the Bank's total deposits were $3.06 billion, an increase of $88.3 million, or 3.0%, from $2.97 billion at December 31, 2023. Modest organic deposit growth during 2024 was primarily due to our team\u2019s success in attracting new deposit relationships while also maintaining existing balances amid heightened industry-wide pricing competition. Growth was tempered by the Bank\u2019s strategic decision to allow certain higher-cost and non-core funding to leave the Bank. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, stockholders\u2019 equity increased by $38.3\u00a0million, or 10.3%, primarily due to net income, partially offset by dividends. As of December 31, 2024, the Bank continued to exceed all regulatory capital requirements to be considered well-capitalized, with a Tier 1 Leverage ratio of 9.50%, a Tier 1 Risk-Based capital ratio of 9.70%, a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of 9.70%, and a Total Risk-Based capital ratio of 11.56%. The tangible stockholders' equity to tangible assets ratio iii increased to 9.56% as of December 31, 2024 compared to 8.89% at December 31, 2023. Asset Quality First Bank's asset quality metrics for the fourth quarter of 2024 remained favorable. Total nonperforming loans declined from $25.0 million at December 31, 2023 to $11.7 million at December 31, 2024, while total nonperforming assets declined from $25.0 million to $17.3 million during the same period. The Bank recorded net recoveries of $155,000\u00a0during the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to net charge-offs of $386,000 in the third quarter of 2024 and net charge-offs of $209,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023. The allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of total loans measured 1.20% at December 31, 2024, compared to 1.21% at September 30, 2024 and 1.40% at December 31, 2023. The decline from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 reflected\u00a0the $5.5 million charge-off and elimination of the Bank\u2019s reserves on a Malvern purchase credit deteriorated\u00a0loan transferred to OREO during the first quarter of 2024. Liquidity and Borrowings Management believes the Bank\u2019s current liquidity position, coupled with our various contingent funding sources, provides us with a strong liquidity base and a diverse source of funding options. The Bank utilized its excess liquidity position to support strong loan growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 which led to total cash and cash equivalents decreasing by $40.4 million to $271.9 million at December 31, 2024, compared to September 30, 2024. Borrowings increased by $9.9 million compared to September 30, 2024, as the Bank utilized some Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d) advances to support loan growth, while continuing to maintain adequate available borrowing capacity at the FHLB. Cash Dividend Declared On January 21, 2025, the Bank\u2019s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share to common stockholders of record at the close of business on February 7, 2025, payable on February 21, 2025. Share Repurchase Program During the fourth quarter of 2024 the Bank repurchased 93,546 shares of common stock at an average price of $14.31, under the share repurchase program authorized in October 2024. The share repurchase program provides for the repurchase of up to 1.0 million shares of First Bank common stock for an aggregate repurchase amount of up to $16.0 million. The share repurchase program will expire on September 30, 2025.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Andy Harmening, President and CEO, for opening remarks. Please go ahead, sir. Andrew Harmening We continue to see signs of strength in the US economy and closer to home in the Midwest, the situation has remained remarkably stable. Unemployment rates in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and several other Midwestern states remained well below the national average of 4.1%. Our prime and super prime consumer borrowers have remained resilient, and our commercial customers are cautiously optimistic about their growth prospects in 2025. This continued stability has enabled us to remain front-footed with the execution of our growth strategy. And the fourth quarter was an active one for our company. We added to our commercial capabilities through the launch of a new specialty deposit and payment solutions vertical. We raised over $300 million of new capital through a common stock issuance and put a portion of that capital to work through a balance sheet repositioning, selling approximately $700 million in low-yielding mortgage loans and $1.3 billion in AFS securities. We also purchased $55 million in existing customer credit customer credit card balances through an expansion of our participation agreement with Elan Financial Services. During the quarter, we also announced the addition of two widely respected business leaders to our Board of Directors and Kristen Ludgate and Owen Sullivan. We elevated three senior business line leaders to our executive leadership team and the Head of Corporate and Commercial Banking, Phil Trier; Deputy Head of Commercial Real Estate, Greg Warsek; and Deputy Head of Consumer and Business Banking, Steve Zandpour, and we welcomed several high-quality RMs to our growing commercial team. Importantly, we also delivered strong financial results during the quarter as we've continued to benefit from our organic growth strategies. Here in Q4, we delivered adjusted loan growth of over $500 million and core customer deposit growth of nearly $900 million, while maintaining stability and discipline with regards to credit risk. As we look forward to 2025, we are positioned to play offense and we're entering the year with a consumer value proposition that stacks up with anyone in the industry. A growing customer -- a growing customer household base with deepened relationships, strong and improving customer satisfaction results and expanding commercial team with deep expertise and capabilities and an enhanced profitability profile from the balance sheet repositioning we announced in December. Taken together, these actions have positioned associated for strong performance in '25 and beyond. With that, I'd like to walk through some additional financial highlights from the quarter and 2024 as a whole, beginning on slide 2. Our fourth quarter results were impacted by nonrecurring items tied to the balance sheet repositioning we announced in December. After excluding these nonrecurring items, the emerging momentum of our core businesses was reflected through adjusted earnings per share of $0.57. Core customer deposits grew by nearly $900 million during the quarter, and on the other side of the balance sheet, we grew total loans by over $500 million after adjusting for the mortgage loan sale announced in December. Over $300 million of that growth came in our commercial and business lending segments. An emerging growth story within our commercial business is starting to take hold. We've said all along that our intention is to fund the majority of our loan growth with core customer deposits. And in 2024, we did just that. For the year, we grew core customer deposits by $1.2 billion or 4.3% and adjusted loans by $1.3 billion or 4.4%. This will remain a point of emphasis for us in 2025. Shifting to the income statement. Our net interest income increased $8 million from Q3 and finished at $270 million our margin increased 3 basis points to 2.81%. Due to the timing of our balance sheet repositioning, we expect to realize most of the margin benefit from the transaction here in Q1 of 2025. Our GAAP noninterest income was impacted by nonrecurring items tied to our balance sheet repositioning during Q4. But on an adjusted basis, we saw a $5 million quarterly increase. Total adjusted noninterest expense finished at $210 million for the quarter. And while we've continued to make strategic investments in support of our growth plan, staying disciplined on expenses remains a foundational focus of our company. Another foundational focus is managing credit risk. Here in Q4, our nonaccrual loans, charge-offs and provision all decreased versus the prior quarter and the same period last year. In 2025, we remain committed to staying ahead of the curve by taking a disciplined, consistent approach to loan risk ratings so that we can better understand credit risk in our portfolio by both segment and geography. On slide 3, we provided a detailed breakdown of EPS impact from several nonrecurring items impacted our financial results in Q4. First, the balance sheet repositioning we announced during the quarter impacted our income statement through a $130 million loss from the sale of mortgages and another $148 million net loss on the security sale we completed. Combined, these items reduced noninterest income by $279 million. Second, our total noninterest expense was impacted by a $14 million loss on prepayment of FHLB advances tied to the repositioning. And finally, our provision increased slightly due to the net impact of a release from the sale of mortgage loans and a build from the credit card balances we purchased during the quarter. Net of tax, our adjusted EPS came in at a positive $0.57 for the quarter. This adjusted number underscores the strength of our core businesses and gives us confidence that we're on the right path with our strategic plan as we move into 2025. Shifting to slide 4. We've made significant progress as a company since I joined in 2021. And thanks to several tailwinds that have started to emerge, I'm more confident than ever that we're on the right track first. we've made several key leadership hires over the course of the past 12 to 24 months, and those hires are having an impact. This includes the three recent executive leadership team members added in Q4 and but it also includes Jayne Hladio who stepped into her role as President of our Private Wealth business in late '23. In the short time she's been here, we've already seen more new relationships, increased referrals and higher sales activity for retirement plans and other services. Second, we now have a consumer value proposition that can compete with just about anyone in the industry, which has better equipped us to deepen relationships with existing customers and attract new ones. The results can be seen in our record high customer satisfaction scores, positive household growth trends and improved quality of those households. Given current market dynamics, we've tweaked our net household growth expectations for 2025 and but we continue to be encouraged by the momentum we've seen to date. Third, we've continued to make progress on our efforts to diversify our consumer loan portfolio without abandoning our conservative approach to credit. By getting out of TPO lending, shifting to an originate-to-sell model and reposition our balance sheet we've reduced our resi loan concentration from a high of 36% of total loans before I got here to 24% of total loans as of year-end, which has provided capacity to grow in more profitable lending categories. And finally, commercial banking is a central component of our growth strategy. We've added 21 of 26 planned hires and expect to have hiring fully completed by the end of Q1. As mentioned previously, we expect the balance sheet impact of these new hires to increase throughout 2025 as the new RMs across our footprint settle in and build their respective pipelines. On slide 5, we highlight our loan trends through the quarter. After excluding mortgage loans sold as part of the balance sheet repositioning, total loans increased by $501 million in Q4. This growth was led once again by C&I, which grew by over $300 million in Q4. We also saw $157 million in CRE investor growth during the quarter, which was largely driven by the completion of construction projects in Q4. While we continue to expect elevated payoff activity in the coming quarters, payoffs were limited in the fourth quarter. As we continue diversifying our consumer portfolio, we saw auto finance balances grow by $101 million here in Q4 and other consumer categories grew by $69 million. The latter was largely driven by the $55 million in credit card balances we purchased during the quarter. On slide 6, we show loan trends on an annual basis. And since 2020, the trend has been clear. we've decreased our reliance on low-yielding noncustomer residential mortgage loans and diversified into higher-return categories all while growing our total loan portfolio by over 20% and maintaining our conservative approach to credit. More recently, total loans grew by $552 million from year-end '23 to year-end '24. This growth has been highlighted by emerging traction in our commercial business, particularly in the back half of '24. After growing C&I loans, $230 million in the first half of the year, we grew by over $600 million in the back half of the year as the RMs we've hired are steadily accelerating their production. We have clear momentum in the commercial space. we have the leaders in place. Our hiring is largely complete and pipelines continue to build. As such, we expect C&I loan growth of $1.2 billion in 2025. More broadly, we continue to seek selective growth that emphasizes full banking relationships, quality credit profiles and diversification to deliver improved returns. With this in mind, we expect total bank loan growth of 5% to 6% for the year. Moving to slide 7. We had mentioned back that some expected customer deposit growth to pick up in the back half of the year, and that trend largely played out as we expected. Through adding over $600 million in core customer deposits in Q3, we added nearly $900 million here in Q4. Unlike Q3, which saw heavy CD inflows, growth in Q4 was driven primarily by interest-bearing demand, money market and savings categories. The inflow of core customer deposits during the quarter once again enabled us to work down our wholesale funding reliance. Total wholesale funding sources were down 3% in Q4. On slide 8, we show deposits on an annual basis. We've consistently grown our average annual deposits as our balance sheet has expanded over the years and the impact of our efforts to grow core customer deposits have emerged more clearly in 2024. On a spot basis, core customer deposits grew by $1.2 billion or 4.3% versus 2023. As we look to 2025, our intention is to continue funding our loan growth primarily with core customer deposits and progress against our strategic initiatives has provided several promising tailwinds on as we look to continue attracting, deepening and retaining customer relationships. As such, we expect core customer deposits to grow by 4% to 5% for the year. With that, I'll pass it to Derek to walk through the income statement and capital trends. Story Continues Derek Meyer Thanks, Andy. I'll start on slide 9 with our asset and liability yield trends. Following the 50 basis point Fed rate cut in September and subsequent 25 basis point cuts in November and December, earning asset yields and interest-bearing liability costs both fell meaningfully during the fourth quarter. Total bank in asset yields decreased by 22 basis points during the quarter, led by a 43 basis point decrease in CRE loans and a 53 basis point decrease in commercial and business lending both of which were largely floating rate portfolios that respond more quickly to changes in market rates. These decreases were partially offset by relative stability in our large fixed rate auto, resi and securities books. On the other side of the balance sheet, total liability costs decreased by 30 basis points during the quarter. This larger decrease was a function of our ability to decrease interest-bearing deposit costs by 22 basis points during the quarter along with our efforts to pay down wholesale funding. Moving to slide 10. Our total net interest income grew by $8 million versus the prior quarter and $17 million versus Q4 of 2023, landing at $270 million for the quarter. Our net interest margin expanded by 3 basis points to 2.81%. During the quarter, due to the timing of the securities reinvestment, which closed at the end of the year and the timing of the loan sale, which is expected to be settled by the end of the month, the NII benefit we saw in Q4 was largely driven by initial securities sale in the refinancing of our high-cost FHLB advances. On a pro forma basis, we estimate that our balance sheet repositioning, including the credit card balance acquisition we made in December, would have added approximately 17 more basis points to our net interest margin, having received a full quarter's benefit from the transaction. Based on our latest expectations for balance sheet growth, deposit betas and Fed action, along with the enhanced profitability from our balance sheet repositioning, we expect to drive net interest income growth of between 12% and 13% in 2025. On slide 11, we provide a reminder of the proactive steps we've taken to get a more neutral asset sensitivity position. Our auto book has grown to $2.8 billion as of year-end, providing a solid base of fixed rate assets with low prepayment risk and strong credit characteristics. In addition, as of December 31, and we maintained notional swap balances of approximately $2.7 billion. And finally, we had $10.3 billion in contractual funding obligations set to mature in 1 year or less as of Q4, which is over 90% of the total. Taken together, these actions have reduced our asset sensitivity over time with a down 100 ramp scenario representing about 0.5% impact to our NII at Q4. This is reduced from the 3.4% impact we were modeling in Q4 of 2022. Our goal is to maintain this modestly asset-sensitive position going forward. Shifting to slide 12. Our securities book increased to $8.5 billion on a period-end basis with the increase largely driven by the settlement of securities purchases as part of the balance sheet repositioning we announced in December. During the quarter, we saw a pickup in our CET1 ratio, thanks to capital raised from the common stock offering we announced in December. And after putting a portion of that capital to work in the balance sheet repositioning we announced in December, CET1 landed at an even 10% at year-end. We also saw a reduction in our AOCI impact due to our securities sale. And as such, the gap between our regulatory CET1 ratio and our CET1 plus AOCI ratio decreased to just 22 basis points in Q4. Following the transaction, our securities plus cash to total assets ratio rose to 22% for the fourth quarter, and we would expect to manage the ratio in the 22% to 24% range in 2025. Our noninterest income trends are highlighted on slide 13. As Andy mentioned, our GAAP results reflected a net loss for the fourth quarter, and this loss was driven by nonrecurring items tied to the balance sheet repositioning we announced in December. Adjusting for these results, our core noninterest income came in at $72 million in Q4, representing a $5 million increase versus the prior quarter and a $2 million increase versus our adjusted Q4 2023 figure. The quarterly increase was primarily driven in the increases in capital markets and mortgage banking income, partially offset by a decrease in bulding income. Compared to the same period last year, wealth management fees grew by $3 million, while deposit fees and mortgage banking income both grew by $2 million. In 2025, we expect noninterest income to grow by 0% to 1% as compared to our adjusted 2024 base of $269 million. Moving to slide 14. Our fourth quarter expenses were impacted by a $14 million loss on the prepayment of FHLB advances as part of our balance sheet repositioning. Excluding this nonrecurring item, our adjusted noninterest expense came in at $210 million in Q4. This adjusted number represents a $9 million increase from the third quarter, but just a $1 million increase from our adjusted Q4 2023 expenses. The bulk of the quarterly increase stemmed from investments in our organic initiatives, including an acceleration of hiring that increased our personnel expense in Q4. For the full year, our noninterest expense came in at $804 million after adjusting to exclude the nonrecurring loss on HLD prepayment. While we've continued to invest in people and strategies to support our growth plans, we've also remained squarely focused on managing our overall expense run rate on an ongoing basis. With that in mind, we expect the total noninterest expense growth of between 3% and 4% in 2025 off of our adjusted 2020 base of $804 million. On slide 15, we once again saw key capital ratios increased across the board here in Q4 after raising $331 million of capital with our November common stock offering. While we did put a portion of this capital to work with the balance sheet repositioning we announced in December, we still expect to maintain a higher level of capital than we did pre transaction. Our TCE ratio increased to 7.82% in Q4, which represents a 32 basis point increase relative to Q3 and a 71 basis point increase relative to Q4 of 2023. Our CET1 ratio steadily climbed throughout 2024 and currently sits at 10% as of Q4, a 28 basis point increase relative to Q3. With that said, we expect to see an incremental 7 basis points of benefits of CET1 once our loan sale closes here in Q1. Following the actions we took in Q4, our expectations for growth in 2025 and the current market conditions, we expect to manage CET1 within a range of 10% to 10.5% in 2025. I'll now hand it over to Chief Credit Officer, Pat Ahern, to provide an update on credit quality. Patrick Ahern Thanks, Derek. I'll start with an allowance update on slide 16. We utilized the Moody's November 2024 baseline forecast for our CECL forward-looking assumptions. The Moody's baseline forecast remains consistent with a resilient economy despite the high interest rate environment. The baseline forecast contains no additional rate hikes, slower but positive GDP growth rates, a cooling labor market and continued deceleration of inflation with continued monitoring of ongoing market developments. Our ACLL increased by another $5 million in Q4 to finish the quarter at $402 million with increases in the commercial and business lending and other consumer categories, partially offset by decreases in CRE and residential mortgage. The uptick in commercial largely stemmed from some migration into criticized loans during Q4. Similar to last quarter, we do not feel that this increase is an indication of a significant shift in credit stress but rather, it is a reflection of our assurance to risk rating definition guidance, acknowledging shifts in credit profiles. The bank does not view these credits representing risk of loss at this time. as reflected in our stable ACL. Altogether, our reserve to loan ratio increased by 2 basis points from the prior quarter and 3 basis points from the same period a year ago to 1.35%. Moving to slide 17. We maintained a high degree of confidence in the quality of our loan portfolio with continued solid performance in our core credit quality trends. Total bank-wide delinquencies increased to $80 million for the quarter representing a $24 million increase from the prior quarter but a $4 million decrease from Q4 of 2023. We continue to believe these trends are in line with our normal course of business and not necessarily something that's indicative of future credit stress. Importantly, the quarterly increase was limited to the 30- to 89-day bucket, reflecting some timing and completion of recent credit actions. 90-plus stage delinquencies have decreased both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year coming in at just $3 million in Q4. Further down the line, total criticized and classified loans increased from the prior quarter. The majority of this increase was driven by migration within C&I and CRE categories. Similar to Q3, we do not feel this increase is an indication of a significant shift in the credit profile of the portfolio but rather a reflection of conforming to industry guidance in a proactive and conservative approach relative to credit changes. We continue our ongoing portfolio deep dives and don't see a systemic shift in our commercial portfolios. In fact, we see potential near-term resolution in many of the noted downgrades as liquidity remains present in the market. Underpinning our confidence in the portfolio is the continued positive trends we're seeing in nonaccruals. We continue to see a steady pace of resolution within these stressed credits with total nonaccrual balances decreasing for the third consecutive quarter to $123 million. Importantly, we saw decreases in both commercial and business lending and CRE net accruals in Q4 as well. Finally, we booked $12 million in net charge-offs during the quarter and $17 million in provision, both of which represented the lowest numbers we've seen in the past several quarters. As Andy mentioned, our Q4 provision included a $3 million release for the sale of residential mortgage loans we announced in December and a $4 million provision build for a purchase of $55 million in credit card balances during the quarter. Our net charge-off ratio decreased by 2 basis points to 0.16%. In summary, our credit metrics continue to give us confidence that what we've seen to date is a handful of credits migrating within our rating system and not necessarily a sign of broader issues coming down the road in future quarters. Overall, outside of these specific situations, we remain comfortable in the normalized level of activity we've seen across the bank. Going forward, we remain diligent on monitoring credit stresses in the macro economy to ensure current underwriting reflects both inflation pressures and shifting labor markets to name just a few economic concerns. In addition, we continue to maintain specific attention to the effects of elevated interest rates on the portfolio, including ongoing interest rate sensitivity analysis bank-wide. We expect any future provision adjustments will continue to reflect changes to risk rates, economic conditions, loan volumes, and other indications of credit quality. With that, I will now pass it back to Andy for closing remarks. Andrew Harmening Thank you, Pat. I'll wrap up by reiterating a couple of key points from our presentation on slide 18, starting with the balance sheet. We continue to seek selective growth that emphasizes full banking relationships, quality credit profiles and diversification to deliver improved returns. With this in mind, we expect total loan growth of 5% to 6% in 2025. On the other side of the balance sheet, we continue to expect to fund the majority of our loan growth with growth in our core customer deposits. As such, we expect core customer deposits to grow by 4% to 5% in 2025. On the revenue front, we've adjusted our most recent forecast for balance sheet growth, deposit betas and Fed action, along with the enhanced profitability from our balance sheet repositioning. With all these factors incorporated, we expect to drive net interest income growth between 12% to 13% in 2025. We also continue to feel encouraged by the durability of our noninterest income in a challenged environment over the past couple of years, and we expect to grow noninterest income by 0% to 1% in '25 relative to our adjusted 2024 base. And finally, our disciplined approach to expenses remains a foundational focus. We continue to strategically invest in our business to support growth. With this in mind, we expect to hold noninterest expense growth to a range of 3% to 4% in 2025. And with that, I would like to open it up for questions. Question and Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions) Scott Siefers, Piper Sandler. Scott Siefers Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Let's see, Derek, I was hoping you could just discuss your thoughts on the trajectory of the margin from the fourth quarter is 2.81%. Look, I mean we've got a good starting point given the disclosure on slide 10 with the 2.98% pro forma, which presumably gets us the full benefit from the restructuring. But just curious about the other moving parts you see on the horizon. And then I guess within the response you can maybe discuss funding dynamics in a little detail given that you'd expect to grow deposits at a lower than loans this year? I know funding with core deposits is always a key priority. So just curious on those dynamics, please. Derek Meyer Yeah. Thanks, Scott. The -- so I think we're largely looking for a stable outlook in margin once we get the benefit of this there could be upside to that being that we're asset sensitive and the market bias right now seems to be fewer cuts than before. but we are asset sensitive and with the rate curve and our assumption in our outlook includes two cuts continue to drive improved profitability while rates are going down, exposes us to a little bit of that sensitivity. So what we expect to help us aside from this transaction and lock in closer to that 3% is the benefits of the hedge the hedging. So we have the hedging details we put in back for the first time. You'll see that we continue to reduce our asset sensitivity going forward in the downgrade scenario and that is the scenario that's out there in the implied forwards. And then the securities repositioning gives us upside to help lock that in and stay longer. And then the auto book, we dropped for the first time, we do expect that to stabilize and continue to modestly go up, albeit at a slower pace than it has been. From the funding dynamics, I think we -- when we put our guidance out from 2024, we had a gap there also. We managed to close that gap by the end of the year and predominantly fund our loan growth with deposit growth. I think we do want to recognize that's still take some build out from our side to support the new deposit vertical and closing that gap beyond what we've put in our guidance may start to accelerate towards the end of the year and into 2026. So we might see -- we've got essentially a 1% gap that we expect our wholesale funding to close, and we've got that GAAP capacity as a result of continuing to pay down FHLB funding from our current position. Tried to answer all your questions, Scott, but -- Scott Siefers Yeah, no, I think that's perfect and thank you. And I guess the final one was Andy, maybe you could talk about the $1.2 billion of C&I growth you expect this year? I think that compares to $750 million number you had discussed previously. I could be comparing apples to oranges but if I'm correct, maybe if you can just walk through the main drivers of that favorable delta? Andrew Harmening Yeah, of course. So I mean you're pretty close. Page 6 outlines a little bit of what the trend is right now. And I think we're roughly at about $840 million in growth in 2024 with about $1.2 billion in 2025. So if you look at our forecast going from 4%-plus growth in '24 to 5%-plus, 5% to 6% in '25, you can see it's largely coming from commercial. You can also see that there's a trend emerging. We expected back half of '24 to be stronger than the first half as we were ramping up. we have largely concluded our hiring. We'll expect to announce a few more to close that out in the first quarter. But we don't intend to spend the whole year hiring. This has been something that we announced in the fourth quarter and not only build the number, but we have gotten incredibly high-quality RM. So really, the increase in commercial is just a function of them being here a full year, will be more on average in the full year. and then really doing a ramped up production. So we have a lot clearer visibility into what's possible in 2025. So we just extrapolated that. I would add to that, that we have on the ABL and the leasing side, that's a business that we started about 3 years ago, and we've continued to grow it. It now has about $1.2 billion in outstandings. But that continues the opportunity for us as well. So the commercial growth plan that we've had is right on track, and I'm very pleased with where we are heading into the year-end and that is why we see that ramp up in growth in 2025. Scott Siefers Perfect. All right. Thank you very much. Andrew Harmening Thank you, Scott. Operator Daniel Tamayo, Raymond James. Daniel Tamayo Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. I guess, first, just on the credit side, one for Pat here. You've talked about the deep dive that you're doing on the loan portfolio and how that's impacting the ratings on the loans. I'm just curious how far along you are in that process and if we should expect to continue to see some migration just related to the work that you're doing in that? Patrick Ahern We're doing the deep dives -- just for clarity, we're doing on a constant basis, and we've been doing it for the last couple of years. So really, what you're seeing is just early recognition of any changes in credit. So that's an ongoing process that we're constantly looking at. And I would say from quarter-to-quarter, there's certainly ins and outs that come with the normal course of business. And we're just trying to be a little more proactive on how we're doing the risk rating to get ahead of it if there is going to be any stress. But the good news is we're not seeing any buildup in the nonaccrual. So we think we're staying ahead of these things as they do pop up. Daniel Tamayo Okay, thank you. And then maybe one for you, Andy. With these significant changes that you've been making overall that you've talked a lot about and then the balance sheet changes that you made here in the fourth quarter, do you think it's likely that the major changes are over? It sounds like you're through the majority of the hiring on the commercial side. But as it relates to the balance sheet structure, does it feel like the major changes are done? Or are there still some changes that you'd be interested in making in the future? Andrew Harmening Well, it's a great question. So what I would say is what we needed to prove out is that we could grow organically and we could shift the mix. We're proving that out right now. We saw an opportunity to inorganically take down our residential real estate concentration of noncustomer residential real estate. And we've largely done that. Will there be other opportunities? We don't have anything planned in 2024. But there are always different opportunities that we look at from an organic growth standpoint. And right now because we have a business that is growing on the commercial side, it's growing its deposit base. It has household growth. We have customer satisfaction. We've invested in digital we have the ability to scale at this point. So opportunistically, if there's a deal in the next 12 to 24 months, we have a team that's very stable and could move down that path. But right now, for 2024, what I see is a really good opportunity to execute on the organic side. Daniel Tamayo Okay, great. Well, I appreciate you taking my questions. Thank you. Andrew Harmening Thanks, Daniel. Operator Terry McEvoy, Stephens. Terry McEvoy Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe, Andy, a question for you. The record high customer satisfaction scores, the Net Promoter Score is all moving in the right direction. My question is, how and where does that translate into growth when we look at the balance sheet and the income statement? And does that give you the confidence in the 6% core consumer deposit growth that you've talked about? Andrew Harmening Yeah, Terry. I think if I were at a town hall, I think that was a planted question because that is right in our wheelhouse. And I've talked a lot about customer satisfaction. We've talked about household growth and we want to make that a question that's on the road somewhere. And so I'll break it down like this. In '22, we shrunk our customer base 1%. In '23, we grew at 0% in '24, we grew at 1%, and now we're forecasting 2%. The reason that matters is because between '22 and '24, the quality of account in dollars increased 23%. So the number that we have now for growth, every time we grow by 1%, that equates to about $150 million in additional balances. So this is the first time we've had a tailwind coming into the year in over a decade. And that tailwind and that productivity expectation now goes from $150 million to a 2% growth, it goes to $300 million. So we look at that then we add on top of that, we added a posit vertical that's just getting started. We've hired really talented people, and we're accelerating whatever technology expectations we have to make sure that they are effective. but there's no doubt that they are experts in what they do. We add on to that 20-plus RMs going into the year with a balanced scorecard that incents them to bring in full relationships. That is just an acceleration of everything we've done. And then we don't talk about it a whole lot, but we've invested in our HSA business, which is also a deposit-heavy business. So when I add household growth with quality accounts, when we add new deposit vertical, when we had increase in RM's balance scorecard and HSA, we're not just hoping that we grow faster than the marketplace. We've invested in the strategies to do that. And so that's where I get a confidence on where I see the deposit growth coming. Terry McEvoy I swear, they didn't e-mail me that question, I swear . And then just as a follow-up, I think we all would agree, you're positioned to play offense in '25. Some of the larger banks are now committing to grow loan growth this year and maybe more of your metro markets. So how did you think about your expense guide for the year? And what might be a more competitive environment, especially as what Scott brought up on the C&I side, where you had a lot of success in the second half of the year? Andrew Harmening Maybe I'll translate that question. Is it -- can we stay in the 3% to 4%? Or do we have pressure on the upside? Is that what you mean on the expense number? Terry McEvoy No, I was talking on the loan growth and large banks being more added competitive. Andrew Harmening Yeah, on the pricing side. And so what -- I've actually been asking this question this week, whether that be from our Chief Credit Officer, who sees every deal or our Head of Commercial. And across the markets that we're in, with the verticals that we're in, we have not experienced the pricing pressure on the deals that we've been putting on the books. And as you can see, we've been putting an increased amount on the books. And so when you get quality relationship managers that have market knowledge and long-term relationships, that's the primary driver. We would not be immune, of course, if the marketplace created that pressure on pricing on new deals, but we just haven't seen it at this point. Derek Meyer Thanks for taking my questions. Andrew Harmening Thank you, Terry. Operator (Operator Instructions) And if there are no further questions, I'd like to turn the floor back to management for any closing comments. Andrew Harmening Well, what I will say in closing is we have as much momentum heading into the year as we've had in the four years that I've been here. We appreciate your interest in the Associated Bank story, and we look forward to providing updates as the year goes along. Thank you. Operator This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you again for your participation.

and Operating Results Covenant Logistics Group, Inc. Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 12:05 AM 25 min read In This Article: CVLG -2.38% Covenant Logistics Group, Inc. CHATTANOOGA, Tenn., Jan. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Covenant Logistics Group, Inc. (NYSE: CVLG) (\u201cCovenant\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) announced today financial and operating results for the fourth\u00a0quarter ended\u00a0December 31, 2024. The Company\u2019s conference call to discuss the quarter will be held at 10:00 A.M. Eastern Time on Friday,\u00a0January 24, 2025. All references made to share or per share amounts in this press release have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of our recent 2-for-1 stock split. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David R. Parker, commented: \u201cWe are pleased to report fourth quarter earnings of $0.24 per diluted share and non-GAAP adjusted earnings of $0.49 per diluted share, on 27.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding after giving effect to our recent 2-for-1 stock split. These results mark the end of another successful year despite a challenging general freight environment, and I could not be happier with how our team has planned and adjusted throughout the year. \u201cThe fourth quarter once again highlighted the impact of our diversified business model. This quarter, our Dedicated segment's adjusted profitability fell short of our expectations due to greater-than-anticipated temporary customer shutdowns and volume reductions, as well as higher costs related to guaranteed driver pay and a large current period casualty claim expense. However, our asset-light segments, including Managed Freight and Warehousing, outperformed expectations by providing overflow capacity for our asset-based segments, executing on peak opportunities, and focusing on cost control. Additionally, our Expedited segment capitalized on a better peak season and improved network balance to deliver solid results on a smaller fleet. \u201cOur 49% equity method investment with Transport Enterprise Leasing (TEL) contributed pre-tax net income of $3.0 million, or $0.08 per share, compared to $4.7 million, or $0.13 per share, in the same quarter of 2023. The decrease in pre-tax net income for TEL was primarily due to softening of the equipment market, which suppressed gains on the sale of used equipment, and increased interest expense associated with higher interest rates on equipment-related debt.\u201d A summary of our fourth quarter financial performance: Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, ($000s, except per share information) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Total Revenue $ 277,331 $ 273,985 $ 1,131,476 $ 1,103,573 Freight Revenue, Excludes Fuel Surcharge $ 251,145 $ 240,006 $ 1,013,941 $ 970,509 Operating Income $ 8,613 $ 14,267 $ 44,760 $ 58,823 Adjusted Operating Income (1) $ 17,943 $ 17,132 $ 70,740 $ 63,846 Operating Ratio 96.9 % 94.8 % 96.0 % 94.7 % Adjusted Operating Ratio (1) 92.9 % 92.9 % 93.0 % 93.4 % Net Income $ 6,720 $ 12,795 $ 35,921 $ 55,229 Adjusted Net Income (1) $ 13,687 $ 14,791 $ 54,977 $ 57,508 Earnings per Diluted Share $ 0.24 $ 0.47 $ 1.30 $ 2.00 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share (1) $ 0.49 $ 0.55 $ 1.98 $ 2.08 (1) Represents non-GAAP measures.

Combined Truckload Revenue Paul Bunn, the Company\u2019s President commented on truckload operations, \u201cFor the quarter, total revenue in our truckload operations\u00a0increased\u00a03.5%, to $190.4 million, compared to 2023. The increase\u00a0in total revenue\u00a0consisted of\u00a0$14.1 million\u00a0more freight revenue, partially offset by $7.7 million\u00a0less fuel surcharge revenue.\u00a0The increase in freight revenue primarily related to operating 158 or 7.4% more average tractors combined with an increase in freight revenue per total mile, partially offset by a reduction in utilization compared to the prior year.\u201d Story Continues Expedited Truckload Revenue Mr. Bunn added, \u201cFreight revenue in our Expedited segment\u00a0decreased\u00a0$0.7 million, or 0.8%. Average total tractors decreased\u00a0by\u00a040 units to 875, compared to\u00a0915 in the prior year quarter. Average freight revenue per tractor per week\u00a0increased\u00a03.8%\u00a0as a result of a 1.6% increase in freight revenue per total mile and a 2.2% increase in utilization.\u201d Dedicated Truckload Revenue \u201cFor the quarter, freight revenue in our Dedicated segment\u00a0increased\u00a0$14.8 million, or 22.4%. Average total tractors\u00a0increased by\u00a0198 units or 13.2%\u00a0to 1,424, compared to\u00a01,226 in the prior year quarter. Average freight revenue per tractor per week\u00a0increased\u00a05.4% as a result of a 13.2% increase in freight revenue per total mile partially offset by a 6.9% decrease in utilization.\u201d Combined Truckload Operating Expenses Mr. Bunn continued, \u201cOperating expenses in our combined truckload segments were a significant headwind for us in the quarter. Compared to the prior year, our truckload operating cost increased 18 cents, or 6.6%, on a per total mile basis. The drivers of the increase primarily include salaries and wages associated with driver pay, increased operations and maintenance costs to operate our equipment, increased insurance expense associated with current period auto liability claims, increased depreciation expense associated with higher prices of newer equipment, and the recognition of a $6.3 million expense associated with an earnout payment related to our 2023 acquisition of Lew Thompson & Son (which we have chosen to exclude from our non-GAAP adjusted results). \u201cSalaries, wages and related expenses increased year-over-year by 13 cents, or approximately 10%, on a per total mile basis. The increase was driven primarily from the year-over-year impact of significant growth in our dedicated protein supply chain business. As we grow our dedicated fleet in niche services, it requires hiring and retaining skilled drivers to operate specialized equipment on loads that typically have a shorter length of haul, resulting in higher costs on a per total mile basis. \u201cOperations and maintenance expenses increased 2 cents per total mile, or approximately 13%, compared to the prior year. The primary factors driving the growth relate to a combination of an increase in parts and service to repair equipment that experienced an unusually large amount of damage in the quarter. \u201cInsurance and claims expense increased by 2 cents, or approximately 11%, on a per total mile basis, compared to the prior year quarter as a result of a large current period claims incurred. Given our self-insurance limits, the amount of expense recognized from period to period can fluctuate. \u201cFixed expenses related to revenue producing equipment, including leased and rented equipment, depreciation, and gain on sale increased slightly by 1 cent on a per total mile basis, compared to the prior year quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we recognized a slight gain on sale of equipment of $0.1 million, compared to a gain of $0.2 million in the prior year quarter.\u201d Managed Freight Segment Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, ($000s) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Freight Revenue $ 62,271 $ 65,035 $ 248,939 $ 258,903 Operating Income $ 4,232 $ 2,484 $ 12,282 $ 9,388 Adj. Operating Income (1) $ 5,152 $ 2,748 $ 13,995 $ 9,924 Operating Ratio 93.2 % 96.2 % 95.1 % 96.4 % Adj. Operating Ratio (1) 91.7 % 95.8 % 94.4 % 96.2 % (1)\u00a0Represents non-GAAP measures. \u201cFor the quarter, Managed Freight\u2019s freight revenue\u00a0decreased\u00a04.3%, from the prior year quarter. However, operating income\u00a0and adjusted operating income improved approximately 87%\u00a0compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. This year over year improvement in margin is attributable to the team\u2019s effort to identify and execute on profitable freight, assist the Expedited fleet with network imbalances experienced early in the quarter, and a better than anticipated benefit from peak related freight.\u201d Warehousing Segment Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, ($000s) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Freight Revenue $ 24,395 $ 24,604 $ 100,518 $ 99,362 Operating Income $ 2,002 $ 1,190 $ 7,898 $ 2,862 Adj.

Operating Ratio (1) 90.7 % 94.1 % 91.1 % 96.0 % (1)\u00a0Represents non-GAAP measures. \u201cFor the quarter, Warehousing\u2019s freight revenue\u00a0decreased\u00a00.8% versus the prior year quarter. Operating income and adjusted operating income for the Warehousing segment\u00a0increased $0.8 million\u00a0compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, as a result of improvements to direct labor costs\u00a0and the year over year impact of customer rate increases that have taken effect.\u201d Capitalization, Liquidity and Capital Expenditures Tripp Grant, the Company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, added the following comments: \u201cAt December 31, 2024, our total net indebtedness decreased\u00a0by\u00a0$28.7 million to approximately\u00a0$219.6 million\u00a0as compared to December 31, 2023. In addition, our net indebtedness to total capitalization\u00a0decreased to\u00a033.4% at December 31, 2024\u00a0from\u00a038.1% at December 31, 2023. \u201cOur capital allocation for the year included a $10 million earnout payment related to the achievement of certain milestones of AAT, approximately $103 million toward planned net capital expenditures in tractors and trailers allowing us to optimize the average age of our fleet and grow our dedicated business and approximately $6 million in dividend payments. \u201cAt December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $35.6 million. Under our ABL credit facility, we had no borrowings outstanding, undrawn letters of credit outstanding of $19.8 million, and available borrowing capacity of $90.2 million. The sole financial covenant under our ABL facility is a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant that is tested only when available borrowing capacity is below a certain threshold. Based on availability as of December 31, 2024, no testing was required, and we do not expect testing to be required in the foreseeable future. \u201cAt the end of the quarter, we had $0.1 million in assets held for sale that we anticipate disposing of within twelve months. The average age of our tractors slightly increased to 20 months compared to 19 months a year ago. \u201cOur baseline expectation for net capital equipment expenditures in 2025 is $70 million to $80 million and reflects our priorities of growing our dedicated footprint, maintaining the average age of our fleet in a manner that allows us to optimize operational uptime and related operating costs, and offering a fleet of equipment that our professional drivers are proud to operate. We expect the benefits of improved utilization, fuel economy and maintenance costs to produce acceptable returns despite increased prices of new equipment and potentially lower values of used equipment.\u201d Outlook Mr. Parker concluded, \u201cFor the quarter, the general freight market appears to be incrementally improving as capacity and demand are better balanced than they have been for approximately two years, and customers are acknowledging this during rate and volume allocation discussions. However, in our dedicated markets, customers continue to experience greater than expected temporary customer shutdowns and volume pressure. Additionally, bad weather has hampered operations and increased our costs during January, limiting any benefit of general market uplift. Beyond the first quarter, we are focusing on positioning the Company to execute quickly and gain operating leverage as conditions improve, continuing to capture new dedicated contracts to expand the fleet organically, and evaluating multiple acquisition and investment opportunities. Our goal remains to grow profitably and generate meaningful returns for our stockholders while providing world-class career opportunities for our team members.\u201d Conference Call Information The Company will host a live conference call tomorrow, January 24, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time to discuss the quarter.

Primary services include asset- based expedited and dedicated truckload capacity, as well as asset-light warehousing, transportation management, and freight brokerage capability.

Covenant's Class A common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, \u201cCVLG.\u201d (1) See GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation in the schedules included with this release. In addition to operating income (loss), operating ratio, net income, and earnings per diluted share, we use adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted operating ratio, adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP measures, as key measures of profitability. Adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted operating ratio, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share are not substitutes for operating income (loss), operating ratio, net income, and earnings per diluted share measured in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. We believe our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because it provides investors and securities analysts with supplemental information that we use internally for purposes of assessing profitability. Further, our Board and management use non-GAAP operating income (loss), operating ratio, net income, and earnings per diluted share measures on a supplemental basis to remove items that may not be an indicator of performance from period-to-period. Although we believe that adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted operating ratio, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share improves comparability in analyzing our period-to-period performance, they could limit comparability to other companies in our industry, if those companies define such measures differently. Because of these limitations, adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted operating ratio, adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per diluted share should not be considered measures of income generated by our business or discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures on a supplemental basis.

Changes to trade regulation, quotas, duties, or tariffs; Litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations; Increasing attention on environmental, social and governance matters may have a negative impact on our business, impose additional costs on us, and expose us to additional risks; Our ABL credit facility and other financing arrangements contain certain covenants, restrictions, and requirements, and we may be unable to comply with such covenants, restrictions, and requirements; In the future, we may need to obtain additional financing that may not be available or, if it is available, may result in a reduction in the percentage ownership of our stockholders; Our indebtedness and finance and operating lease obligations could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our industry or business; Our profitability may be materially adversely impacted if our capital investments do not match customer demand or if there is a decline in the availability of funding sources for these investments; Increased prices for new revenue equipment, design changes of new engines, future uses of autonomous tractors, volatility in the used equipment market, decreased availability of new revenue equipment, and the failure of manufacturers to meet their sale or trade-back obligations to us could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and profitability; Our 49% owned subsidiary, Transport Enterprise Leasing, faces certain additional risks particular to its operations, any one of which could adversely affect our operating results; We could determine that our goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired, thus recognizing a related loss; Our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and his wife control a large portion of our stock and have substantial control over us, which could limit other stockholders' ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including changes of control;

as CEO Vince operates a network of 47 full-price retail stores and 14 outlet stores.

Jangoulun Singsit Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 3:53 PM 2 min read In This Article: VNCE -1.42% The stake was acquired from affiliates of Sun Capital Partners, marking P180's third strategic acquisition since its establishment last year. P180's recent investments include the fashion brand Altuzarra and a digital collaboration with the premium multi-brand retailer elysewalker. P180 was co-founded by Christine Hunsicker, who also founded CaaStle, and Hoffman. It focuses on enhancing the financial outcomes for brands and retailers. Established in 2002, Vince has a network of 47 full-price retail stores, 14 outlet stores, and its e-commerce site. The fashion brand offers its subscription service, Vince Unfold, which is operated by CaaStle. The retailer reported a 4.7% decline in net sales to $80.12m in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to decreased direct-to-consumer and wholesale sales within the brand. The transaction has positioned P180 as the beneficial owner of approximately 65% of Vince's outstanding common stock, while Sun Capital's affiliates retain around 2%. Vince chairman Michael Mardy said: \"P180's acquisition represents a transformative opportunity for VNCE. With this transaction, we will gain the operational expertise and cutting-edge digital capabilities needed to drive the brand's future success.\u201d Hoffman is expected to take on the CEO role around 3 February 2025, pending finalisation of his employment agreement. Previously, he held the CEO position at Vince for five years. Concurrent with this change in leadership, David Stefko will resign from his interim CEO role but continue his service on the Board. Additionally, Matthew Garff has tendered his resignation from the Board in relation to the acquisition. Hoffman said: \"VNCE is the perfect partner for P180; the brand's dominance in the luxury contemporary market aligns seamlessly with our acquisition strategy. \"Personally, I have a strong connection to the Vince brand, having served as VNCE CEO for five years. I am excited to lead the team again as we continue to unlock new growth opportunities, drive innovation, enhance the brand's market position, and focus on monetizing the Company\u2019s inventory to ensure continued long-term success.\" In tandem with these developments, Vince has taken measures to significantly reduce its debt burden. An indirect subsidiary of Vince, V Opco, amended its ABL Credit Facility with Bank of America. This amendment accommodated a change in control due to the P180 Acquisition and allowed for a partial paydown of subordinated debt through increased borrowings under the ABL facility. Story Continues Consequently, V Opco paid $15m towards its obligations to SK Financial Services\u2014an affiliate of Sun Capital\u2014using proceeds from this credit facility, reducing its subordinated loans by approximately $27. This strategic financial manoeuvring not only alleviates Vince's debt profile but also positions it for enhanced financial flexibility and operational efficiency going forward. \"P180 assumes majority control of Vince Holding, Hoffman back as CEO\" was originally created and published by Just Style , a GlobalData owned brand.
