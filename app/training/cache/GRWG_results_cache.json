Vertical farming refers to producing food in vertically stacked layers, like in a used warehouse, skyscraper, or shipping container. Hydroponic agriculture refers to a technique for cultivating plants without traditional soil and replacing them with a mineral solution placed around plant roots. The global agricultural sector continues to undergo a transformative shift. This transition stems from the increased demand for sustainable, efficient, and locally-produced food. Innovative strategies such as vertical farming and controlled environment agriculture (CEA) have emerged and these are offering promising solutions to revolutionize food production. There are several SMEs and start-ups leading the charge in vertical farming and controlled environment agriculture. Ranging from small-scale urban farms to well-established high-tech agricultural operations, these organizations have been revolutionizing food production, courtesy of innovation, sustainability, and efficiency. For example, AeroFarms has been reforming agriculture with its advanced aeroponic systems. These systems utilize 95% less water and 99% less land when compared to traditional methods. Also, the company's fully automated systems grow pesticide-free leafy greens year-round, offering superior flavor and nutrition. Another company is Zero Carbon Farms, which focuses on repurposing underground air raid shelters in London into climate-controlled vertical farms. The company's innovation capabilities help in growing microgreens and herbs by using 70%-90% less water and 95% less fertilizer than traditional agriculture. By carrying out operations underground, it significantly reduces emissions while offering fresh produce locally.

Florida remains home to the country\u2019s largest medical marijuana market, adding around $2 billion in annual revenue.

(GRWG) the Best Marijuana Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds? Sultan Khalid Thu, Dec 26, 2024, 10:11 PM 6 min read In This Article: GRWG -2.86% We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Marijuana Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where GrowGeneration Corp. (NASDAQ:GRWG) stands against the other marijuana stocks. The United States of America is the country that consumes the most weed in the world. As we mentioned in our article \u2013 30 Cities with the Highest Weed Consumption in the US \u2013 the American legal cannabis industry fared well in 2023 as legal sales across the 38 states that allow some form of regulated marijuana reached $28.8 billion, a 10.3% increase from the previous year. After an eventful 2024, the industry is expected to flourish even further.\u00a0 According to a report from the wholesale marketplace LeafLink, retail sales of cannabis reached a record $2.8 billion in October 2024, up 6.2% from last year. The data revealed that America\u2019s total retail cannabis sales for this year are expected to be in the proximity of $32.6 billion. The US legal weed industry also added 22,952 new jobs last year \u2013 a sign that the national business climate has somewhat stabilized following the turmoil of the previous two years. According to the 2024 Vangst Jobs Report, there were over 440,445 jobs supported by legal cannabis nationwide as of early 2024, an increase of 5.4% from 2023. READ ALSO: Top 12 Oil and Gas Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds Perhaps this year\u2019s most positive news for the country\u2019s legal cannabis sector came in April, when the Drug Enforcement Agency announced that it would act on the Biden administration\u2019s call to reclassify marijuana from a \u2018Schedule I\u2019 drug, which includes heroin and LSD, to a less tightly regulated \u2018Schedule III\u2019 drug, which includes ketamine and some anabolic steroids. The decision marked a major policy shift by the federal government and while it would neither make the substance legal nor decriminalize it on a federal level, it would loosen quite a few restrictions around it and add fresh arguments for supporters of ballot measures seeking to legalize cannabis in states where it is still illegal. The process is lengthy and complex and will stretch well into the next year, but as the DEA finalizes its review, stakeholders from across the industry are closely monitoring developments. Another encouraging development came in the form of a tweet from President-elect Donald Trump, in which he expressed support for a recreational cannabis legalization ballot initiative in his home state of Florida. He also backed up the marijuana industry\u2019s access to the banking system and the ongoing federal cannabis rescheduling process. Whether this support will actually translate into action when Trump takes office for his second term remains to be seen. Story Continues However, 2024 ended with a slightly sour taste in the mouth of America\u2019s cannabis stakeholders, as Florida\u2019s cannabis legalization ballot measure failed to pass, despite historic levels of funding and a rigorous advertising campaign. This was a major blow to the industry as the Sunshine State was expected to become a $6 billion cannabis market by 2026, had Amendment 3 succeeded in meeting the required 60% threshold. The setback inevitably impacted cannabis stocks, which witnessed a downturn following the news of the rejection. Amplify Alternative Harvest ETF, the first US ETF to target the global cannabis sector has fallen by over 31.6% since November 4, closing at $2.27 on December 24, 2024. As of the writing of this article, 24 states have legalized recreational weed in America , in addition to the District of Columbia. However, possessing or selling marijuana remains a crime under federal law, punishable by prison time and fines. Methodology : To collect data for this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds and picked the top 11 companies operating in the cannabis sector with the highest number of hedge fund investors.

A farmer placing an accessory into a hydroponic system, filled with a nutrient-rich growing media. GrowGeneration Corp. (NASDAQ: GRWG ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 6 GrowGeneration Corp. (NASDAQ:GRWG) sells hydroponic gardening products for use in new and emerging industries or segments, including the growing of cannabis. Incorporated in Colorado in 2014, GrowGen claims to be the largest chain of specialty retail hydroponic and organic garden centers in the United States. The stock of GrowGeneration Corp. (NASDAQ:GRWG) has tumbled to a 52-week low, closing at $1.61 on December 24, reflecting a persistent downtrend in the hydroponic and organic gardening supplies sector. The company had a mixed Q3 2024 as its revenue fell by over 10.1% YoY to reach $50 million, but still beat analysts\u2019 estimates by $1.28 million. The drop was driven by the closure of 19 retail locations as part of the company\u2019s ongoing restructuring, including 12 solely in the last quarter. Net loss also increased by almost 56% YoY to reach $11.4 million. However, there was encouraging news regarding same-store sales, which grew by 12.5%, supported by strong commercial sales and robust customer retention. This marked the first quarter of positive same-store sales in the last three years. Operating expenses were also down by 5.4%, falling to $22.9 million, as the company continued to streamline its operations through store consolidations and cost-cutting measures. GrowGeneration Corp. (NASDAQ:GRWG) ended Q3 with a solid cash position, maintaining $55.2 million in cash equivalents and marketable securities, with zero debt. It also repurchased an additional $1.8 million of shares during the quarter, as it \u2018continues to believe its equity has a compelling value\u2019. In line with GrowGeneration Corp. (NASDAQ:GRWG)\u2019s stated objective for proprietary brand sales to account for 35% of total gardening sales by the end of 2025,\u00a0 the company announced the launch of three new premium product lines last month, in product categories that include grow lighting, essential accessories, and medium for indoor growing and greenhouse hydroponics.

Sultan Khalid Mon, Dec 16, 2024, 9:14 AM 6 min read In This Article: GRWG -2.86% We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Cannabis Stocks To Invest In . In this article, we are going to take a look at where GrowGeneration Corp. (NASDAQ:GRWG) stands against the other best cannabis stocks to invest in. The history of cannabis cultivation in America dates back to the early colonists, who grew hemp for textiles and rope. The plant was also widely used as a patent medicine during the 19th and early 20th centuries, described in the United States Pharmacopeia for the first time in 1850. Several political and racial factors led to the criminalization of cannabis in 1937 with the passage of the Marijuana Tax Act, but its legal status is now finally changing in many places. READ ALSO: 20 States with the Highest Weed Consumption in the US Cannabis Industry in the United States The United States of America is the country that consumes the most weed in the world. As we mentioned in our article \u2013 30 Cities with the Highest Weed Consumption in the US \u2013 the American legal cannabis industry fared well in 2023 as legal sales across the 38 states that allow some form of regulated marijuana reached $28.8 billion, a 10.3% increase from the previous year. Meanwhile, the legal cannabis industry also added 22,952 new jobs last year \u2013 a sign that the national business climate has somewhat stabilized following the turmoil of the previous two years. According to the 2024 Vangst Jobs Report, there were over 440,445 jobs supported by legal cannabis nationwide as of early 2024, an increase of 5.4% from 2023. The increasing legalization of cannabis and rising acceptance of its use for medical purposes are the key factors fueling the industry. Growth is also expected to come from new markets. One such example is Nebraska\u2019s vote in favor of legalizing medical marijuana last month. As of the writing of this article, 24 states have legalized recreational weed in America , in addition to the District of Columbia. However, possessing or selling marijuana remains a crime under federal law, punishable by prison time and fines. Major Blow to the US Cannabis Revolution In a significant setback for America\u2019s legal cannabis industry, Florida voters rejected a ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana in November. The measure, known as Amendment 3, got 55.9% support, failing to meet the required 60% threshold. This was despite historic levels of funding, a rigorous advertising campaign, and even an endorsement from President-elect Donald Trump. Florida, with its population of 20 million people, is already home to the country\u2019s largest medical marijuana market, boasting an annual revenue of $2 billion. The Sunshine State is also a popular tourist destination (especially during spring break) and attracts more than 140 million tourists every year. If Amendment 3 had been passed, Florida was expected to become a $6 billion cannabis market by 2026. Story Continues Through the Smart & Safe Campaign, Florida\u2019s cannabis companies and individual donors collectively contributed more than $150 million to get legalization enacted into law, with most of it coming from the largest medical marijuana operator in the state. On the other hand, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who aggressively campaigned against Amendment 3, spent an estimated $50 million of taxpayer money on radio and television ads to successfully convince enough voters to reject the measure. Meanwhile, hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin also came out against legalization and donated $12 million to the Vote No On 3 campaign. This setback inevitably had an impact on cannabis stocks, which witnessed a downturn following the news of the rejection. Amplify Alternative Harvest ETF, the first US ETF to target the global cannabis industry, has fallen by almost 30% since November 4, closing at $2.33 on December 13, 2024. Florida voters will now have to wait for two more years before cannabis legalization can get back on the ballot.

Loss, Tops Revenue Estimates Zacks Equity Research Wed, Nov 13, 2024, 1:35 AM 3 min read In This Article: HBM -0.73% GrowGeneration (GRWG) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.19 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.11. This compares to loss of $0.12 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -72.73%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post a loss of $0.08 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.10, delivering a surprise of -25%. Over the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates. GrowGeneration , which belongs to the Zacks Agriculture - Products industry, posted revenues of $50.01 million for the quarter ended September 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.31%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $55.68 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. GrowGeneration shares have lost about 25.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 25.8%. What's Next for GrowGeneration? While GrowGeneration has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for GrowGeneration: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

-2.86% Even when a business is losing money, it's possible for shareholders to make money if they buy a good business at the right price. For example, although Amazon.com made losses for many years after listing, if you had bought and held the shares since 1999, you would have made a fortune. Nonetheless, only a fool would ignore the risk that a loss making company burns through its cash too quickly. So, the natural question for GrowGeneration ( NASDAQ:GRWG ) shareholders is whether they should be concerned by its rate of cash burn. In this report, we will consider the company's annual negative free cash flow, henceforth referring to it as the 'cash burn'. We'll start by comparing its cash burn with its cash reserves in order to calculate its cash runway. Check out our latest analysis for GrowGeneration When Might GrowGeneration Run Out Of Money? A company's cash runway is the amount of time it would take to burn through its cash reserves at its current cash burn rate. When GrowGeneration last reported its September 2024 balance sheet in November 2024, it had zero debt and cash worth US$55m. Looking at the last year, the company burnt through US$6.8m. Therefore, from September 2024 it had 8.1 years of cash runway. Even though this is but one measure of the company's cash burn, the thought of such a long cash runway warms our bellies in a comforting way. You can see how its cash balance has changed over time in the image below. NasdaqCM:GRWG Debt to Equity History December 18th 2024 How Well Is GrowGeneration Growing? Notably, GrowGeneration actually ramped up its cash burn very hard and fast in the last year, by 184%, signifying heavy investment in the business. While that's concerning on it's own, the fact that operating revenue was actually down 13% over the same period makes us positively tremulous. Considering these two factors together makes us nervous about the direction the company seems to be heading. Clearly, however, the crucial factor is whether the company will grow its business going forward. For that reason, it makes a lot of sense to take a look at our analyst forecasts for the company . Can GrowGeneration Raise More Cash Easily? While GrowGeneration seems to be in a fairly good position, it's still worth considering how easily it could raise more cash, even just to fuel faster growth. Companies can raise capital through either debt or equity. Commonly, a business will sell new shares in itself to raise cash and drive growth. We can compare a company's cash burn to its market capitalisation to get a sense for how many new shares a company would have to issue to fund one year's operations. Story Continues GrowGeneration has a market capitalisation of US$101m and burnt through US$6.8m last year, which is 6.7% of the company's market value. That's a low proportion, so we figure the company would be able to raise more cash to fund growth, with a little dilution, or even to simply borrow some money. So, Should We Worry About GrowGeneration's Cash Burn? Even though its increasing cash burn makes us a little nervous, we are compelled to mention that we thought GrowGeneration's cash runway was relatively promising. Cash burning companies are always on the riskier side of things, but after considering all of the factors discussed in this short piece, we're not too worried about its rate of cash burn. Its important for readers to be cognizant of the risks that can affect the company's operations, and we've picked out 1 warning sign for GrowGeneration that investors should know when investing in the stock. Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Quarter 2024 Financial Results Business Wire Wed, Nov 13, 2024, 12:05 AM 18 min read In This Article: GRWG -2.86% Same Store Sales increased 12.5% year-over-year Proprietary brand sales increased to 23.8%; Up from 19.4% in the same period of 2023 Cash balance of $55.2 million and no debt DENVER, November 12, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- GrowGeneration Corp. (NASDAQ: GRWG) (\"GrowGeneration,\" \"GrowGen,\" or the \"Company\"), one of the largest retailers and distributors of specialty hydroponic and organic gardening products in the United States, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. Third Quarter 2024 Summary Net sales decreased 10.2% year over year to $50.0 million for the third quarter 2024, due to 25 less retail locations; Positive same-store sales of 12.5% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior year; Proprietary brand sales as a percentage of Cultivation and Gardening net sales increased to 23.8% as compared to 19.4% in the third quarter of 2023; Gross profit margin of 21.6%, a 750 basis point decrease from the 29.1% in the year ago period mainly due to restructuring related activities; Operating expenses decreased $1.3 million, or 5.4%, to $22.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same prior year period; Net loss of $11.4 million the third quarter of 2024 compared to a net loss of $7.3 million in the year ago period; Adjusted EBITDA (1) loss of $2.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of $1.5 million from the year ago period; and Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $55.2 million and no debt. Darren Lampert, GrowGen\u2019s Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"Our third quarter results were consistent with our expectations and reflect the substantial progress we have made executing on our strategic restructuring plan. In particular, we exceeded our near-term targets for proprietary brand sales as a percentage of Cultivation and Gardening net sales, which grew to 23.8%, compared to 19.4% for the third quarter last year. This is tracking well against our goal to grow proprietary brand sales to 35% in 2025. Additionally, same-store sales grew 12.5% year-over-year in the third quarter, reflecting the strong performance of our core store locations as we right-size our retail footprint. In addition, we met our store closures target, even as we maintained our focus on improving efficiencies, reducing store and other operating expenses by 13.9% during the quarter. Our financial position also remains strong, with $55.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and no debt.\" \"Our same-store sales growth, reduction in expenses and the improvement in our proprietary brand sales all demonstrate, our actions to date have proven successful in positioning GrowGen for sustainable growth in 2025. In line with these priorities, we are also on track to launch our e-commerce portal in the fourth quarter of this year, which is a key part of our digital transformation and B2B customer focus. We are well-positioned in the industry to capitalize on growth opportunities, and our restructuring plan has put us on a stronger footing to drive revenue growth, optimize margins, and build a leaner, more profitable company,\" added Mr. Lampert. Story Continues Third Quarter 2024 Consolidated Results Net sales declined $5.7 million, or 10.2%, to $50.0 million for the third quarter 2024 compared to $55.7 million for the third quarter 2023. The decrease in net sales was primarily related to our Cultivation and Gardening segment, which had net sales of $41.4 million for the third quarter 2024 compared to $48.0 million for the same prior year period. Cultivation and Gardening\u2019s decrease in net sales was primarily driven by the fiscal 2023 consolidation of 6 retail locations after the third quarter 2023 in addition to 19 retail locations to date in fiscal 2024, which include the 12 redundant or underperforming retail locations consolidated in conjunction with our strategic restructuring plan announced in July 2024. Additionally, we estimate that sales discounts offered as part of our strategic restructuring plan at those 12 retail locations negatively impacted net sales by approximately $0.9 million in the third quarter 2024. Cultivation and Gardening\u2019s same-store sales increased 12.5%, primarily attributable to commercial sales growth, customer retention in markets where there were retail location closures, and improvements in our e-commerce site sales volume. Proprietary brand sales as a percentage of Cultivation and Gardening net sales for the third quarter 2024 increased to 23.8% as compared to 19.4% for the same prior year period largely driven by our strategic initiatives to increase sales volume with our expanded portfolio of proprietary brands and products and various proprietary product launches. The percentage of Cultivation and Gardening net sales related to consumable products remained relatively flat at 73.3% and 73.5% for the third quarter 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additionally, net sales of commercial fixtures within our Storage Solutions segment increased by 12.9% to $8.6 million for the third quarter 2024 compared to $7.6 million for the year ago period, primarily due to increased demand from retail customers and timing differences of various projects being pushed into the third quarter of 2024 from the prior quarter. Gross profit was $10.8 million for the third quarter 2024 compared to $16.2 million for the third quarter 2023, a decrease of $5.4 million or 33.2%. The decrease in gross profit was driven primarily by our Cultivation and Gardening segment, which decreased $5.5 million, or 43.3%, largely as a result of the 25 store consolidations since the end of the third quarter 2023 as well as the effects of our strategic restructuring plan, which include the $0.9 million in sales discounts and an additional $1.0 million of inventory disposal costs incurred in the third quarter 2024. Gross profit from our Storage Solutions segment increased $0.1 million, or 2.7%, to $3.6 million for the third quarter 2024 compared to $3.5 million for the third quarter 2023. Gross profit margin decreased to 21.6% for the third quarter 2024, compared to 29.1% for the year ago period. The decrease in gross profit margin was largely driven by our Gardening and Cultivation segment, which had a gross profit margin of 17.3% for the third quarter 2024 as compared to 26.3% for the third quarter 2023, due to the effects of the strategic restructuring plan, including the inventory disposal costs and inventory sales discounts, reduced inventory discounts from vendors, and continued industry pricing compression on distributed products. Gross profit margin also decreased for our Storage Solutions segment to 42.2% in the third quarter 2024 from 46.4% in the same prior year period primarily driven by higher costs of inventory. Adjusted Gross Profit (2) and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin (2) , which exclude the effects of the strategic restructuring plan announced in July 2024, were $12.7 million and 25.4% for the third quarter 2024, respectively, compared to $16.2 million and 29.1% for the third quarter 2023. Store and other operating expenses for the third quarter 2024 were $10.0 million compared to $11.7 million in the year ago period, a decrease of 13.9%, primarily driven by the 25 store consolidations since the end of the third quarter 2023. Selling, general, and administrative expenses in the third quarter 2024 were $7.4 million compared to $7.6 million in the third quarter 2023, a decrease of 2.3%. GAAP net loss was $11.4 million for the third quarter 2024, or a loss of $0.19 per diluted share, compared to $7.3 million in the year ago period, or a loss of $0.12 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA (1) was a loss of $2.4 million in the third quarter 2024, compared to Adjusted EBITDA (1) loss of $0.9 million in the same prior year period. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 were $55.2 million. Inventory as of September 30, 2024 was $48.0 million, and prepaid and other current assets were $7.7 million. Total current liabilities, including accounts payable, accrued payroll, and other liabilities as of September 30, 2024 were $24.5 million. Geographical Footprint Our geographic footprint for our Cultivation and Gardening segment spans 724,000 square feet of retail and warehouse space and includes 31 retail locations across 12 states. To date in fiscal 2024, we have consolidated 19 retail stores where we generally expect to be able to serve the same customer base through a single location, thereby reducing redundancies in cost structure. Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Outlook (3) As a result of its previously announced restructuring plan, GrowGen expects full-year 2024 net sales in the range of $190 million to $195 million. In the prior quarter, we had removed our full-year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance as we assessed the impact of the restructuring, and we expect to provide updated Adjusted EBITDA guidance at a later date.

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, when used in conjunction with their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, net income (loss), gross profit, and gross profit margin, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors, facilitating the evaluation of performance across reporting periods, identify trends affecting our business, and project future performance. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for internal planning and reporting purposes, and we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance, our ability to generate cash, and valuation. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures address questions routinely received from analysts and investors and, in order to ensure that all investors have access to the same data, we have determined that it is appropriate to make this data available to all investors. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in our industry and should not be construed in isolation as substitutions to net income (loss) as indicators of operating performance or as alternatives to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity (each as determined in accordance with GAAP). GrowGeneration defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest income, interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted to exclude certain items such as stock-based compensation, impairment losses, restructuring and corporate rationalization costs, and other non-core or non-recurring expenses and to include income from our marketable securities as these investments are part of our operational business strategy and increase the cash available to us.

GrowGeneration calculates Adjusted Gross Profit as gross profit adjusted to exclude the effects related to the strategic restructuring plan, and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin is calculated as Adjusted Gross Profit as a percentage of net sales.

Positive Points GrowGeneration Corp ( NASDAQ:GRWG ) achieved a 12.5% increase in same-store sales, marking the first positive growth in three years. The company successfully closed 19 underperforming stores as part of its restructuring plan, focusing on higher-performing locations. Proprietary brand sales grew to 23.8% of total sales, up from 19.4% last year, driven by new product launches. The company maintained a strong cash position with $55.2 million and no debt as of September 30, 2024. GrowGeneration Corp ( NASDAQ:GRWG ) is launching a B2B e-commerce portal to enhance customer experience and streamline operations. Negative Points Net revenue for the third quarter was $50 million, a decline from $55.7 million in the same period last year, primarily due to store closures. Gross profit margin decreased to 21.6% from 29.1% in the previous year, impacted by inventory costs and store liquidation sales. The company reported a net loss of $11.4 million for the third quarter, compared to a net loss of $7.3 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $2.4 million, worsening from negative $0.9 million in the previous year. The restructuring process, including store closures and inventory adjustments, is expected to continue impacting margins into the fourth quarter. Q & A Highlights Q : Can you remind us about the ongoing rationalization of the store base and when it will be completed? A : Darren Lampert, CEO: We currently have 31 stores, down from about 65. We've closed 19 stores this year and 25 year-over-year. We're comfortable with 31 stores but may close a few more next year. GrowGen is now a go-to name for cultivators, and we don't need as many stores as we build out distribution and our B2B network. Story continues Q : How is the performance of new proprietary brands compared to legacy brands? A : Darren Lampert, CEO: We've spent the last three years on R&D and testing products. Our proprietary brands are seeing adoption, and we're selling into distribution. We expect 35% of sales next year to be from proprietary brands, which have higher margins than other products. Q : Can you provide more details on efforts to build out the commercial business and sales with larger players? A : Greg Sanders, CFO: There's a tremendous opportunity as the industry evolves. GrowGen is a go-to for accounting, credit, product, and distribution. We have a strong balance sheet, $55 million in cash, and the largest inventory positions in the industry. Our commercial team is highly talented and works closely with customers. Q : What is the expected impact of the B2B portal on margins and revenue? A : Greg Sanders, CFO: The B2B portal will provide individual pricing and availability, reducing manual processes and freeing up staff to focus on customer service. It should increase margins by optimizing inventory and shipping. We expect it to be a significant part of GrowGen 2.0. Q : How is customer retention from closed stores impacting same-store sales? A : Greg Sanders, CFO: We've retained a majority of commercial customers, which has contributed to a 12.5% increase in same-store sales. We're seeing a small turn in the industry and expect continued growth as we complete restructuring by the end of the year.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $145.35 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
