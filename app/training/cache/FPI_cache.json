[{"text": "A Delicate Balance: India's Economy in a Period of Caution Amid Rising Pressures - DUN & BRADSTREET PR Newswire Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 11:23 AM 6 min read MUMBAI, India , Jan. 24, 2025 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0Dun & Bradstreet, a global leader in business decisioning data and analytics, has released its Economy Observer report for January 2025 . Economy Observer is a monthly report sharing in-depth analysis of key macroeconomic developments in India and provides forecasts for key economic indicators, and insight into the expected direction of the Indian economy. Dun & Bradstreet India Logo Key economic forecast: Real Economy : India's economy appears to be in a cyclical downturn, with activity slowing in the first half of FY2024-25. This deceleration has been driven by\u00a0macroprudential tightening in lending, reduced public expenditure in an election year, and a cyclical slowdown in private consumption and investment, as reflected in high-frequency indicators. The National Statistical Office projects real GDP growth at 6.4% for the fiscal year 2024-25, weighed down by slower mining and manufacturing activities. Dun & Bradstreet expects IIP growth to moderate to 4.0% in December 2024 , reflecting both global uncertainties and domestic pressures, with industrial production momentum cooling as the base effect normalizes. The February budget will play a crucial role in addressing subdued public spending and stimulating growth. To boost consumption, especially in rural and urban areas, we anticipate enhanced allocations for programs like MGNREGA, PM KISAN, and PMAY, along with potential tax incentives to promote rural and urban spending. At the same time, we expect driving investment growth to remain a key focus, with an expected Rs 1 -1.5 lakh crore increase in capital expenditure over FY25's revised estimates. The government's borrowing program is likely to rise only marginally to around Rs 15 lakh crore, which should keep bond yields stable. Meanwhile, the fiscal deficit is expected to undershoot the 4.9% target for FY25 by ~10 bps, with a further reduction to 4.3-4.4% targeted for FY26BE. Overall, while the first half of the fiscal year has been challenging, the second half is expected to see gradual improvement, supported by government measures to drive consumption and investment amid a slowing global growth environment. Price Scenario : India's price scenario in December 2024 showed mixed trends, with WPI inflation rising to 2.4% y/y from 1.9% in November, driven by higher input costs and global commodity pressures. Dun & Bradstreet projects WPI inflation to reach 3.0% in January 2025 , reflecting persistent inflationary pressures. CPI inflation eased slightly to 5.2% in December 2024\u00a0from 5.5% in November 2024 , but rural inflation remained elevated at 5.8% compared to 4.6% in urban areas in December 2024 , driven by higher costs for essential goods. Food inflation, at 8.39% y/y, continued to be a concern, particularly in rural areas . Dun & Bradstreet expects CPI inflation to rise to 5.8% y/y in January, driven by food and fuel cost pressures, increased rural demand, and global uncertainties . Story Continues Money & Finance: The 91-day Treasury Bill yield remained stable at 6.6% in December 2024 , up from 6.5% in November. Dun & Bradstreet forecasts the rate to remain at 6.6% in January 2025 , reflecting expectations of continued cautious monetary policy. Similarly, the 10-year G-Sec yield increased to 6.9% in December 2024 , from 6.8% in November 2024 . Dun & Bradstreet expects 10-year G-sec to stay at 6.9% in January 2025 due to ongoing inflation concerns and fiscal challenges. Bank credit growth moderated to 11.2% in December, down from 12.1% in November, as high-interest rates and economic uncertainty curbed lending activity . Dun & Bradstreet expects bank credit growth to stabilize at 11.5% in January 2025 , reflecting cautious optimism and a focus on managing credit risk . Deposit growth also moderated to 9.8% in December, likely influenced by shifting consumer spending and saving patterns amid a tighter monetary environment. External Sector: India's external sector is facing significant pressure, with the Indian Rupee (INR) depreciating sharply amid a slowdown in foreign portfolio investor (FPI) activity. In December 2024 , the INR/USD exchange rate stood at 85.0, and it is expected to weaken further to 86.3 by January 2025 . Dun & Bradstreet is forecasting further depreciation, with the exchange rate potentially reaching 86.7 in February 2025 , driven by a stronger US dollar, global economic uncertainties, higher oil prices, and capital outflows. Dr.\u00a0Arun Singh, Global Chief Economist, Dun & Bradstreet said,\u00a0\" India's economy is likely in a cyclical downturn, but the outlook for the second half of FY2024-25 is brighter, supported by government measures to boost investment and consumption. With a projected Rs 1 -1.5 lakh crore increase in capital expenditure and enhanced allocations for rural programs, growth momentum is expected to strengthen. Stable bond yields, an improving fiscal deficit, and targeted public spending position India to weather global challenges and sustain economic resilience.\" D&B's Economy Observer Forecast Variables Forecast Latest Period Previous period IIP Growth 4.0% Dec-24 5.2% Nov-24 3.5% Oct-24 Inflation WPI 3.0% Jan-25 2.4% Dec-24 1.9% Nov-24 CPI (Combined) 5.8% Jan-25 5.2% Dec-24 5.5% Nov-24 Exchange Rate (INR/USD) ** 86.7 Feb-25 86.3 Jan-25 85.0 Dec-24 91-day T-Bills* 6.6% Jan-25 6.6% Dec-24 6.5% Nov-24 10-year G-Sec Yield* 6.9% Jan-25 6.9% Dec-24 6.8% Nov-24 Bank Credit 11.5% Jan-25 11.2% Dec-24 12.1% Nov-24 *Weekly Average ** Dun and Bradstreet Forecasts About Dun & Bradstreet: Dun & Bradstreet, a leading global provider of business decisioning data and analytics, enables companies around the world to improve their business performance.

\u2014 and why he says you can ditch the gurus Jing Pan Sat, Jan 25, 2025, 3:30 PM 5 min read Here\u2019s Warren Buffett\u2019s tip for avoiding big mistakes in the stock market \u2014 and why he says you can ditch the gurus When it comes to investing, few command more respect than Warren Buffett. The reason is simple: from 1964 to 2023, his company, Berkshire Hathaway, delivered an astonishing overall gain of 4,384,748% . That kind of success has created immense wealth for its shareholders \u2014 including Buffett himself. Forbes estimates his net worth at $143.5 billion , placing him among the world\u2019s richest individuals. Don't miss Rich, young Americans are ditching the stormy stock market \u2014 here are the alternative assets they're banking on instead Trump says trade tariffs could hit Canada, Mexico and China as early as Feb. 1 \u2014 but US economists warn it could effectively 'tax' Americans instead. Here\u2019s why and how to protect your money ASAP These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2025 \u2014 and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how But the stock market is unpredictable, and not everyone shares Buffett\u2019s track record. We\u2019ve all heard cautionary tales of investors losing fortunes chasing stock tips. Buffett believes many investors fall into a fundamental trap. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Buffett was asked what he sees as the biggest mistake investors make. His response was immediate : \u201cThey just don't realize that all you have to do is just buy a cross section of America, and they never listen to people like me or read the papers or do anything subsequently. They think that because you can trade, you should trade.\u201d Put simply, investors trade too often. Buffett attributes this issue to the stock market\u2019s low transaction costs compared to other asset classes. \u201cYou buy a farm, you buy an apartment house, you can't resell it tomorrow [because of] the cost of moving around. Now you get something handed to you \u2014 liquidity, which in an instant, you can sell, and the cost of doing it are pennies compared to other kinds of investment activity. So because they can so easily move around, they do move around and moving around is not smart in investing,\u201d he explained. In other words, just because you can trade frequently doesn\u2019t mean you should. \u2018The best thing to do\u2019 Buffett\u2019s message is clear \u2014 long-term success in investing doesn\u2019t require constant buying and selling. Instead, he advocates owning a \u201ccross section of America.\u201d This philosophy stems from his unwavering confidence in the U.S. economy. \u201cAmerican business \u2014 and consequently a basket of stocks \u2014 is virtually certain to be worth far more in the years ahead,\u201d Buffett wrote in his 2016 letter to shareholders . Berkshire\u2019s own investment strategy reflects this belief. Its $295-billion equity portfolio is heavily weighted towards American companies across diverse industries, reinforcing Buffett\u2019s faith in the nation\u2019s long-term economic strength. Story Continues For those unsure about which American businesses to invest in, Buffett offers a straightforward solution: \u201cIn my view, for most people, the best thing to do is own the S&P 500 index fund,\u201d he famously stated . This straightforward approach gives investors exposure to 500 of America\u2019s largest companies across various industries, providing diversified exposure without the need for constant monitoring or active trading. Buffett\u2019s commitment to this strategy is evident in his estate planning: he has directed that 90% of his wife\u2019s inheritance be invested in \u201ca very low-cost S&P 500 index fund\u201d after his passing. The beauty of this approach is its accessibility \u2014 anyone, regardless of wealth, can take advantage of it. Even small amounts can grow over time, and some apps even let you invest in an S&P 500 ETF with your spare change , making it easier than ever to build wealth alongside the world\u2019s financial elite.

Protect your nest egg now Buffett likes productive assets Buffett\u2019s point about how \u201cyou can\u2019t resell it tomorrow\u201d when investing in farmland or apartment buildings is worth highlighting. Unlike stocks, which can be traded instantly, real assets come with higher transaction costs \u2014 but that\u2019s not necessarily a drawback. Investors typically aren\u2019t looking for quick flips; they\u2019re in it for the long-term income these assets generate. With farmland, you can earn money through crop sales or leasing fees. With rental properties, you can collect monthly rental income \u2014 both providing a steady cash flow while the asset itself appreciates over time. Buffett has personal experience with both. In 1986, he bought a 400-acre farm near Omaha, and in 1993 he acquired a New York retail property next to NYU. His verdict? \u201cThe two investments will be solid and satisfactory holdings for my lifetime and, subsequently, for my children and grandchildren,\u201d he wrote in his 2013 letter to Berkshire shareholders . He also predicted that the income from the two investments \u201cwill probably increase in the decades to come.\u201d Today, you don\u2019t need to buy a whole farm or an entire building to invest in these asset classes. Investors can gain exposure through real estate investment trusts ( REITs ), which own income-producing real estate. Different REITs specialize in various property types. For instance, Equity Residential (EQR) focuses on apartment buildings, while Farmland Partners (FPI) invests in farmland. Alternatively, crowdfunding platforms have made it easier for average Americans to invest in rental properties without the need for a hefty down payment or the burden of property management. Some platforms will even let you start earning rental income with investments as low as $100.

Aurora at Green Valley MacKenzie Capital Management, LP Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 5:30 PM 3 min read In This Article: MKZR +5.91% MacKenzie Capital Management, LP ORINDA, Calif., Jan. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MacKenzie Realty Capital, Inc . (Nasdaq: MKZR) (\u201cMacKenzie\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is pleased to announce an update on its development called Aurora at Green Valley, in Fairfield, CA. Highlights: Our Aurora project is progressing on schedule with no delays. See www.wisemanco.com/property/aurora-at-green-valley/ The schedule continues to indicate occupancy will begin during the third quarter for the first residential building, with the other two buildings delivered by the end of the year. Sunrise Center clubhouse, with leasing offices, is scheduled to be delivered 45 days prior to the first residential building to assist in leasing activities. That building already has drywall installed. Indoor and outdoor furniture and fitness room equipment has been ordered. Prior to opening of Sunrise Center, we will conduct pre-leasing activities from a professional office located in a nearby office building owned by an affiliate of MRC Aurora, LLC. FPI, our independent property manager, is the biggest manager in northern California in terms of units managed. The project has had minimal overruns \u2013 right now we forecast a total use of only 23% of the contingencies provided in our budget. Next month we expect to commence drawing on our construction loan facility, as we will have invested our $12.5 million cash equity. Our lender is Valley Strong Credit Union and they have already begun performing inspections so that our draw process is expected to be smooth. Market occupancies for similar projects are maintaining at 95% occupancy, including Nova, the newest large project in Green Valley which has now stabilized its 281 units at that 95% level. Rents in this market increased by 25% between 2021 and 2023. Rents pulled back a bit at the end of 2023, but have resumed a positive trend and are now just about 3% off the rental peak established in 2023. We believe there is not enough new product in this growth market to satisfy demand. Robert Dixon, Chief Executive Officer at MacKenzie stated, \u201cWe are excited about the progress we are making in developing the Aurora project and are committed to be helping meet the continued demand for housing in the San Francisco Bay Area. This development is staying on the budget and schedule we initially disclosed. I want to thank our team here at MacKenzie as well as all the contractors and subcontractors involved.\u201d About MacKenzie Realty Capital, Inc.

PERFORMER IN CATEGORY PR Newswire Thu, Jan 16, 2025, 5:54 PM 6 min read The Quantified STF Fund Tops Morningstar Category for Fourth Time in Eight Years BLOOMFIELD HILLS, Mich. , Jan. 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Flexible Plan Investments, Ltd . (FPI), a leading provider of dynamic, risk-managed investment solutions with over $1.5 billion in assets under management (12/31/24), announced that its Quantified STF Fund (QSTFX) was the top performer in the Morningstar Tactical Allocation category (246 funds) in 2024 returning 29.94%. Additionally, the fund sits atop the category (213 funds) for the five-year period ended 12/31/24. It is a repeat performance for the fund as it also led the category in 2023. The fund outpaced its benchmark, the NASDAQ 100\u00ae Index, that returned 25.88% for the past calendar year. It is the fourth time the fund has led its category in the past eight years (2017, 2020, 2023, 2024). The fund was in the bottom decile of performance for its category during the calendar years 2016, 2018, and 2022. \"The repeat performance in 2024 of the STF fund is a result of our team's ability to identify and capitalize on trends while also enhancing our model to evolve with the markets and volatility. The fact that the fund leads in the category for the five-year period, as well, speaks to our objective to provide consistency and predictability in our strategies. STF can be positioned up to two-times long versus the NASDAQ 100\u00ae Index and up to one-times short, depending upon market direction and conditions. While sometimes volatile, the ability to go long and short is part of our dynamic, risk management approach,\" said Jerry Wagner , founder and president of FPI and one of the portfolio managers for the 14 Quantified Funds. Mr. Wagner further added \"Flexible Plan uses the fund extensively in its most popular dynamic, risk-managed SMA strategy: QFC Self-Adjusting Trend Following.\u00a0 Although the fund is aggressive and has even found itself ranked for some years at or near the bottom of its category, using the strategy version reduces its volatility.\u00a0 Another popular FPI strategy, QFC Equity Trends, further reduces the volatility to allow its use with growth investors.\u00a0 Finally, investors with a wide range of suitability profiles can make use of the fund in FPI's Multi-Strategy Portfolios \u2013 available for Conservative, Moderate, Balanced, Growth and Aggressive suitability profiles.\" With respect to the 14 Quantified Funds, Flexible Plan is a subadvisor to Advisors Preferred , a boutique asset manager that manages mutual funds. Advisors Preferred, through its affiliated distributor, Ceros Financial Services, Inc., distributes these funds to financial advisors and financial professionals. Story Continues \"We're thrilled that the STF Fund repeated as the top performer in its category this past year. Knowing that no two years are the same in the markets, we believe this accomplishment speaks to the adaptable, dynamic approach that Flexible Plan employs and shows that strategies like this have a place in professionally managed portfolios,\" said Catherine Ayers-Rigsby , president of Advisors Preferred.

SHANGHAI , Jan. 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- IMPACT Therapeutics (\"IMPACT\"), a biopharmaceutical company focusing on the discovery and development of targeted anti-cancer therapeutics based on synthetic lethality, is pleased to announce that\u00a0Senaparib Capsules (\u6d3e\u8212\u5b81 \u00ae \uff09has received marketing authorization in China from National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial (FIGO Stages III and IV) high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Senaparib, discovered and developed by IMPACT, is a potent and novel PARP 1/2 inhibitor. Its distinctive molecular structure provides it with high in vitro and in vivo activity, exceptional target selectivity and wide safety window. The approval is based on FLAMES Study. The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase III clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Senaparib as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of patients with advanced ovarian cancer who had completed first-line chemotherapy and achieved either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). The results of FLAMES Study showed that Senaparib demonstrated significant improvement in median PFS compared to placebo (PFS not reached vs 13.6 months, HR 0.43, P < 0.0001), irrespective of BRCA status. Senaparib demonstrated a tolerable safety profile, with no noticeable safety issues. [1] The results also indicated that both HRD positive and HRD negative populations derived benefit from Senaparib maintenance therapy, highlighting the potential of Senaparib for broad clinical application. The results of this study will strongly support Senaparib as the Standard of Care for first-line maintenance therapy in patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer. The top-line results of the study were initially presented as a late breaking oral presentation at ESMO in 2023 and presented at CSCO 2024. On May 15, 2024 , the internationally renowned medical journal Nature Medicine also published the results titled \"Senaparib as first-line maintenance therapy in advanced ovarian cancer: a randomized phase 3 trial.\" [1] Ovarian cancer is one of the most common lethal female reproductive malignancies. According to GLOBOCAN 2020 data, the global incidence of ovarian cancer is amounted to 310,000 cases and mortality is amounted to 210,000. According to the latest national cancer statistics released by National Cancer Center in 2024, there were 61,100 new cases of ovarian cancer and 32,600 deaths in China in 2022, making it the most lethal gynecological tumor. Due to the insidious and non-specific early symptoms of ovarian cancer, about 80% of patients are already in advanced stage when they are diagnosed, and the 5-year survival rate is only 41.8%. [2] Although ovarian cancer may be resolved after initial platinum-containing chemotherapy, most patients inevitably face recurrence, and there remains a significant unmet clinical need for treatment in the ovarian cancer patient population. Story Continues In recent years, PARP inhibitors are changing the therapeutic landscape of ovarian cancer, with maintenance therapy extending the duration of sustained remission after platinum-containing chemotherapy and delaying disease recurrence. In December 2023 , IMPACT entered into a collaboration agreement with Zhongmei Huadong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, a subsidiary of Huadong Medicine Co., Ltd (SZ.000963) (collectively, \" Huadong Medicine \") for the commercialization of Senaparib. Under the collaboration agreement, Huadong Medicine receives exclusive promotion rights of Senaparib in mainland China . Huadong Medicine is deeply involved in the field of gynecological oncology. Senaparib and Huadong Medicine's approved mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx (ELAHERE\u00ae) can provide solutions for ovarian cancer patients with different stages of the disease, sharing expert networks, research and clinical resources, promoting and developing together to form an effective and highly synergistic relationship. Dr. Sui Xiong Cai , Chief Executive Officer of IMPACT said: \"It is our great pleasure to share with you the successful approval of Senaparib for the Chinese market, which is another strong proof of the excellence of IMPACT's in-house synthetic lethality R&D platform and the R&D execution team. Leveraging Huadong Medicine's extensive commercial experiences in promoting novel therapeutics, we hope that Senaparib will reach more ovarian cancer patients soon and bring new treatment options for first-line maintenance therapy in advanced ovarian cancer.\" [1] . Nature Medicine volume 30, pages1612\u20131621 (2024) [2] . 2023 White paper on the status of diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer in China About IMPACT Therapeutics IMPACT Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery and development of targeted anti-cancer therapeutics based on synthetic lethality. IMPACT Therapeutics has assembled one of the most comprehensive DNA damage responses (DDR) global pipeline of novel drug candidates generated by in-house discovery efforts and is expanding to other novel synthetic lethality targets to broaden its pipeline. IMPACT's pipeline products include PARP inhibitor Senaparib (IMP4297), WEE1 inhibitor (IMP7068), ATR inhibitor (IMP9064), and PARP1 selective inhibitor (IMP1734, in collaboration with Eikon Therapeutics), as well as other novel DDR pathway inhibitors. The most advanced development program, PARP inhibitor Senaparib (IMP4297), has been in clinical Phase II/III studies globally, including China , in ovarian cancer, small cell lung cancer and other indications. The Phase III clinical study (FLAMES Study) of Senaparib for advanced ovarian cancer maintenance treatment following first-line therapy met primary endpoint, with best-in-class efficacy and safety profile. Based on the results of the FLAMES study, the National Medicines Products Administration (NMPA) has approved the new drug application for Senaparib. The Wee1 inhibitor IMP7068 and the ATR inhibitor IMP9064 have been investigated in Phase I clinical studies in several countries and regions around the world, including U.S. and China , and the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) has been established. PARP1 selective inhibitor IMP1734 has obtained IND clearance from FDA and NMPA, as well as completed FPI in early 2024.

Newswire Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 8:38 PM 3 min read FPI's 2024 report reveals industry's accelerated push toward sustainable solutions, increased use of recycled content, and innovations amid evolving consumer and regulatory demands. FALLS CHURCH, Va. , Nov. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- In response to rising requests for insight into the evolving foodservice packaging landscape, the Foodservice Packaging Institute (FPI) has released its 16th annual \"Trends Report\" for 2024. This comprehensive report, crafted from the insights of industry members and FPI staff, highlights the critical trends and emerging pressures facing the foodservice packaging industry. \"The trends we see in this year's report reflect an industry at the crossroads of innovation and adaptation,\" said Natha Dempsey , president of FPI. \"From the rapid push toward meeting ambitious 2025 packaging goals to navigating new regulations, the foodservice packaging industry is facing challenges head-on while seizing opportunities to redefine its future.\" According to the report, sustainability and the principles of sustainable packaging are no longer merely trends but have become essential components of business practice. With increasing legislative mandates pushing for sustainable solutions, companies are hastening their transition to meet 2025 packaging goals, resulting in significant industry pressure. This urgency drives innovation, as noted in the development of new materials and coatings that enhance recyclability and performance. Furthermore, the report highlights a shift towards \"natural\" colored resins and increased use of post-consumer recycled content, a move driven by both regulatory requirements and market demand. The adoption of extended producer responsibility laws in various U.S. states has added complexity, prompting greater focus on reusable items in dining settings. The industry is also adapting to the competitive pressures from increased imports of both products and machinery, which have introduced cost and logistical advantages. Concurrently, automation in manufacturing and service operations is alleviating some of these pressures by increasing production efficiency and addressing labor shortages. Consumer sentiment, influenced by economic factors, is causing a shift in dining behaviors, emphasizing value and influencing profit margins across the supply chain. Despite these challenges, FPI sees opportunities for progress and innovation within the sector. \"For 16 years, our Trends Report has provided a reliable snapshot of where the foodservice packaging industry is heading,\" Dempsey added. \"This year's insights reaffirm the resilience and forward-thinking nature of our industry as it embraces sustainability and innovation.\" Story Continues This annual survey collects opinions from companies throughout the foodservice packaging supply chain, including raw material and machinery suppliers, packaging manufacturers, distributors and operators. The first section of the report compiles direct comments and insights by industry respondents. The second section provides high-level trends in the foodservice packaging industry based on FPI staff analysis of member submissions, as well as FPI's general industry observations. The 2024 Trends Report is available to FPI members. Non-members may view an executive summary on FPI's website . Please contact Ashley Elzinga at aelzinga@fpi.org for more information.

Industries Berhad (KLSE:FPI) editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Mon, Dec 23, 2024, 6:33 AM 6 min read Key Insights Formosa Prosonic Industries Berhad's estimated fair value is RM3.10 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Formosa Prosonic Industries Berhad's RM2.72 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate The average premium for Formosa Prosonic Industries Berhad's competitors is currently 106% Does the December share price for Formosa Prosonic Industries Berhad ( KLSE:FPI ) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example! Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model . See our latest analysis for Formosa Prosonic Industries Berhad The Model We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Seeing as no analyst estimates of free cash flow are available to us, we have extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the company's last reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF (MYR, Millions) RM70.1m RM65.7m RM63.5m RM62.7m RM62.8m RM63.6m RM64.8m RM66.3m RM68.2m RM70.2m Growth Rate Estimate Source Est @ -10.52% Est @ -6.29% Est @ -3.33% Est @ -1.26% Est @ 0.20% Est @ 1.21% Est @ 1.92% Est @ 2.42% Est @ 2.77% Est @ 3.01% Present Value (MYR, Millions) Discounted @ 10% RM63.5 RM53.9 RM47.2 RM42.2 RM38.3 RM35.1 RM32.4 RM30.1 RM28.0 RM26.1 (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = RM397m Story Continues We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (3.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 10%. Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = RM70m\u00d7 (1 + 3.6%) \u00f7 (10%\u2013 3.6%) = RM1.1b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = RM1.1b\u00f7 ( 1 + 10%) 10 = RM397m The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is RM794m. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of RM2.7, the company appears about fair value at a 12% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. KLSE:FPI Discounted Cash Flow December 23rd 2024 The Assumptions Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Formosa Prosonic Industries Berhad as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.221. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for Formosa Prosonic Industries Berhad Strength Currently debt free. Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows. Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market. Weakness Earnings declined over the past year. Opportunity Current share price is below our estimate of fair value. Lack of analyst coverage makes it difficult to determine FPI's earnings prospects. Threat No apparent threats visible for FPI. Looking Ahead: Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.
