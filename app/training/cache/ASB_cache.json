Jan 24, 2025, 3:34 PM 5 min read In This Article: ASB Associated Banc-Corp \u2019s ASB fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of 57 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents. Also, the bottom line compared favorably with 53 cents earned in the prior-year quarter. See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news. Results benefited from an increase in net interest income (NII) and adjusted non-interest income. A rise in deposit balance and lower provisions acted as tailwinds. However, higher adjusted expenses were the undermining factor. Results excluded certain non-recurring items. After considering these, the net loss available to common shareholders was $164.5 million or $1.03 per share, compared with a net loss of $93.7 million or 62 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. For 2024, adjusted earnings of $2.38 per share beat the consensus estimate of $2.15 and rose 5% year over year. Net income available to common shareholders (GAAP) was $111.6 million or 72 cents per share, down from $171.5 million or $1.13 per share in the year-ago quarter. ASB\u2019s Adjusted Revenues Rise, Adjusted Expenses Up Total adjusted revenues (FTE basis) for the quarter were $345.8 million, up 5% year over year. Also, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $343.3 million. For 2024, total adjusted revenues grew marginally to $1.33 billion. The top line also outpaced the consensus estimate of $1.32 billion. NII was $270.3 million, up 7%. The net interest margin was 2.81%, up 12 basis points (bps) year over year. The increase was driven by a fall in average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities. We had expected NII and net interest yield to be $268.3 million and 2.84%, respectively. The non-interest loss was $206.8 million in the reported quarter compared with a loss of $131 million in the prior-year quarter. Excluding the loss on mortgage portfolio sale and investment securities loss, adjusted non-interest income came in at $71.8 million, rising 2%. Our estimate for the non-interest income was $65 million. Non-interest expenses decreased 6% to $224.3 million. These included certain non-recurring charges. Excluding these, adjusted expenses were $210 million, up marginally. Our estimate for non-interest expenses was $205.4 million and did not include the abovementioned non-recurring charge. The adjusted FTE efficiency ratio was 61.11%, down from 64.12% in the prior-year quarter. A fall in the efficiency ratio indicates an improvement in profitability. Associated Banc-Corp\u2019s Loans Dip, Deposits Rise As of Dec. 31, 2024, total loans were $29.8 billion, down 1% from the prior quarter. The fall was attributable to the sale of $723 million in residential mortgages associated with the balance sheet repositioning. Our estimate for total loans was $30.4 million. On the other hand, total deposits grew 3% to $34.6 billion. Our estimate for total deposits was $34.5 million. Story Continues Associated Banc-Corp\u2019s Credit Quality Improves In the reported quarter, the company recorded a provision for credit losses of $17 million, down 19% from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for the metric was $22 million. As of Dec. 31, 2024, total non-performing assets were $144.2 million, down 10%. Total non-accrual loans were $123.3 million, falling 17%. Net charge-offs were $12.2 million, down 22% from the prior-year quarter. Associated Banc-Corp\u2019s Capital Ratios Improve As of Dec. 31, 2024, the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 10.57%, up from 9.99% recorded in the corresponding period of 2023. The common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 10%, up from 9.39%. Associated Banc-Corp\u2019s Outlook for 2025 Management expects loans to grow at the rate of 5-6%. Total core customer deposits are estimated to rise in the range of 4-5%, while total deposits are projected to increase 1-2%. NII is projected to jump in the 12-13% range. After adjusting to exclude the impact of non-recurring items related to the balance sheet repositioning announced in the fourth quarter of 2024, total non-interest income is expected to be stable or grow 1%. After adjusting to exclude the impact of the loss on prepayments of FHLB advances, total non-interest expenses are likely to rise 3-4%. The effective tax rate is expected to be 19-21%. Our Take on ASB Associated Banc-Corp\u2019s business restructuring efforts are likely to keep supporting financials. The company has a solid balance sheet position, making it well-poised for growth. However, mounting expenses are a headwind. Associated Banc-Corp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Associated Banc-Corp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Associated Banc-Corp price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Associated Banc-Corp Quote ASB currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here . Performance of ASB\u2019s Peers BankUnited, Inc. \u2019s BKU fourth-quarter 2024 earnings of 91 cents per share handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 71 cents. The bottom line compares favorably with 27 cents in the prior-year quarter. BKU\u2019s results were aided by growth in NII and non-interest income alongside lower non-interest expenses and provisions. Also, stable deposits were another positive. However, a fall in loan balance and weak asset quality were the undermining factors. Commerce Bancshares Inc. CBSH reported fourth-quarter 2024 earnings per share of $1.01, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents. The bottom line also jumped 27.8% from the prior-year quarter. Results benefited from a rise in NII and non-interest income. Also, stable adjusted expenses posed a tailwind. However, a substantial jump in provisions hurt CBSH\u2019s results to some extent.

(a) The ratio tangible common equity to tangible assets excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, net. This financial measure has been included as it is considered to be a critical metric with which to analyze and evaluate financial condition and strength. (b) Adjusted net income and adjusted net income available to common equity, which are used in the calculation of return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible common equity, respectively, add back other intangible amortization, net of tax. (c) These capital measurements are used by management, regulators, investors, and analysts to assess, monitor, and compare the quality and composition of our capital with the capital of other financial services companies. (d) These financial measures have been included as they provide meaningful supplemental information to assess trends in the Corporation's results of operations. (e) Management believes this measure is meaningful because it reflects adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators, and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of earnings per common share, provide greater understanding of ongoing operations, and enhance comparability of results with prior periods. (f) The efficiency ratio as defined by the Federal Reserve guidance is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments) divided by the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains (losses), net. The fully tax-equivalent efficiency ratio is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments), excluding other intangible amortization, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains (losses), net. The adjusted efficiency ratio is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments), excluding other intangible amortization, FDIC special assessment costs, and announced initiatives, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains (losses), net and announced initiatives. Management believes the adjusted efficiency ratio is a meaningful measure as it enhances the comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources and provides a better measure as to how the Corporation is managing its expenses by adjusting for nonrecurring costs like the FDIC special assessment and announced initiatives.

Release Date: January 23, 2025 For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript . Positive Points Associated Banc-Corp ( NYSE:ASB ) reported strong financial results with adjusted earnings per share of $0.57, reflecting the strength of its core businesses. The company achieved significant growth in core customer deposits, increasing by nearly $900 million in the fourth quarter. ASB successfully raised over $300 million in new capital through a common stock issuance, which was used for balance sheet repositioning. The company added two respected business leaders to its Board of Directors and elevated three senior business line leaders to its executive leadership team. ASB's commercial and business lending segments showed robust growth, contributing over $300 million to total loan growth in the fourth quarter. Negative Points The fourth quarter results were impacted by nonrecurring items tied to balance sheet repositioning, resulting in a $130 million loss from the sale of mortgages and a $148 million net loss on security sales. Total noninterest expense increased by $9 million from the third quarter, driven by strategic investments and hiring, which could pressure future profitability. The company's allowance for credit losses increased by $5 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting some migration into criticized loans. Total bank-wide delinquencies increased to $80 million for the quarter, indicating potential credit quality concerns. ASB's net interest margin only expanded by 3 basis points to 2.81%, with expectations of further pressure due to asset sensitivity and potential rate cuts. Q & A Highlights Q : Derek, could you discuss the trajectory of the margin from the fourth quarter's 2.81% and the impact of the restructuring? Also, could you elaborate on funding dynamics given the expected growth in deposits and loans? A : Derek Meyer, CFO: We expect a stable margin outlook once we benefit from the restructuring, potentially reaching closer to 3%. The market bias suggests fewer rate cuts, which could provide upside. Our hedging strategies and securities repositioning should help stabilize and potentially increase margins. Regarding funding, we aim to close the gap between loan and deposit growth, primarily through core deposits, and expect to reduce reliance on wholesale funding. Story Continues Q : Andy, could you explain the expected $1.2 billion C&I growth for this year compared to the previous $750 million forecast? A : Andrew Harmening, CEO: The increase is due to our completed hiring of high-quality relationship managers (RMs) and their ramped-up production. We have clearer visibility into 2025's potential, with growth largely driven by commercial activities. Additionally, our asset-based lending and leasing business, which has grown significantly, continues to offer opportunities. Q : Pat, regarding the credit side, how far along are you in the deep dive on the loan portfolio, and should we expect continued migration in loan ratings? A : Patrick Ahern, Chief Credit Officer: The deep dives are ongoing, aimed at early recognition of credit changes. This proactive approach helps us stay ahead of potential stress, and we haven't seen a buildup in nonaccruals, indicating we're managing risks effectively. Q : Andy, with the significant changes made, do you think major changes are over, particularly regarding the balance sheet structure? A : Andrew Harmening, CEO: We've largely completed the necessary changes, especially in reducing residential real estate concentration. While we have no major changes planned for 2024, we remain open to opportunities that align with our growth strategy. Our focus is on executing organic growth. Q : Andy, how do record-high customer satisfaction scores translate into growth, and does this support the 6% core consumer deposit growth target? A : Andrew Harmening, CEO: Improved customer satisfaction and household growth directly impact deposit growth. We've seen a 23% increase in account quality, and each 1% growth in households equates to $150 million in additional balances. Our strategies, including a new deposit vertical and enhanced RM capabilities, support our confidence in achieving the deposit growth target.
