Ping Chan Wed, Jan 1, 2025, 6:02 PM 6 min read milei argentina chainsaw Maga has taken on a new meaning at the Casa Rosada in Buenos Aires. It\u2019s been more than a year since Javier Milei moved into Argentina\u2019s presidential palace, sweeping to power in a landslide victory. The man who looks like Wolverine and thinks like a libertarian has also garnered the attention of the new leader of the free world. Milei was the first world leader to shake Donald Trump\u2019s hand when the Republican candidate enjoyed his own landslide win back in November. \u201cMake Argentina Great Again, you know, Maga. He\u2019s a Maga person,\u201d the incoming US president told guests at a gala held in the ballroom of his Mar-a-Lago estate. The self-styled \u201cel loco\u201d swept to power on a mandate of dismantling the public sector, devaluing the peso and even abolishing the central bank. Milei\u2019s brand of \u201cshock therapy\u201d had its doubters, but even his fiercest critics have been forced to change tack . Inflation and public spending is down, debt is falling and confidence in the economy is on the rise. The figures suggest that Milei\u2019s project is succeeding \u2013 despite vociferous criticism from the country\u2019s Left, with former political leader Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner accusing him of subjecting Argentinians to a \u201cpointless sacrifice\u201d. Price rises have dropped from an annual peak of almost 300pc a year in April to end 2024 near 119pc. While prices doubling is hard for anybody to stomach, inflation is finally headed in the right direction. Milei\u2019s chainsaw, a prop he brandished frequently during the election campaign, has slashed the number of public sector jobs by almost 35,000 since he took office. Argentina is now running a primary fiscal surplus. In other words, excluding debt interest costs, the country is finally living within its means. Despite these steep spending cuts, Latin America\u2019s third-largest economy is also growing again. Argentina exited recession in the third quarter with growth of 3.9pc. Economists say Milei has managed to pull off a feat nothing short of Herculean. David Hauner, at Bank of America, used to work as an economist at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has doled out several financial rescue packages over the decades to keep Argentina afloat. \u201cWe used to have this rule that you can maximum have 0.5pc [of GDP] fiscal adjustment per year, and this guy has delivered five percentage points within less than a year,\u201d he says. Those achievements have been celebrated by financial markets. Borrowing costs and default risks have plummeted and Argentinians are bringing money back into the country. Close to 90pc of the country\u2019s international corporate bonds are trading at interest rates of less than 10pc in a sign that it is considered lower risk. Last summer, just a quarter of debt was changing hands at single digit interest rates. Story Continues \u201cIf you go by the market and by his own popularity ratings, he has done very well,\u201d adds Hauner. \u201cIf you look at how bonds have performed and how high his popularity is, it is remarkable.\u201d \u2018He tells the truth\u2019 Insiders highlight that the adjustment has not been easy. \u201cIt felt like holding up a castle of cards that\u2019s about to fall down,\u201d says one official close to the finance ministry. Even Milei\u2019s biggest fans are surprised at how his popularity has held up, with half the population still backing the economist to complete his project. Unlike Sir Keir Starmer, Milei has always been transparent, the official adds. \u201cHe told the truth,\u201d they say. \u201cDuring the election, he said: \u2018Look, I\u2019m going to slash public spending and eliminate the deficit.\u2019 He said it in his inaugural speech. He says it every time he speaks, and he\u2019s doing it. So people are saying \u2018fair enough\u2019. He said he\u2019s going to do this, and he\u2019s doing it.\u201d \u201cThe guy is 100pc committed to this programme. He thinks Argentina needs a fiscal adjustment. It needs to open the economy. It needs deregulation and lower inflation. And if it works and people support him, then great. If not, then you know what? He thinks they should just kick him out and that\u2019s it.\u201d International organisations are beginning to have faith in Milei where others betrayed their trust. One official based in DC says: \u201cThere was a lot of scepticism at institutions like the IMF and World Bank when Milei first took charge. That\u2019s changed completely. Now it seems like everybody wants to get behind the IMF programme and offer more support. So I would say it\u2019s been a very good year .\u201d However, Milei\u2019s brand of extreme austerity comes with challenges. Unemployment is on the rise and poverty has soared. The country\u2019s central bank is still operating, but with net negative reserves, meaning Argentina has limited firepower to defend the fragile peso by selling dollars without strict capital controls. Removing those controls will be the next step for Milei, who is hoping to revive the economy with an aggressive push to cement Argentina as a key supplier of lithium and copper. The country is already the world\u2019s fourth largest producer of lithium and while support for net zero is waning, Buenos Aires still hopes it can catch larger producers like Chile and China. \u201cNext year needs to be the year when the population can reap the harvest of the recovery,\u201d says Hauner at Bank of America. \u201cClearly it was a remarkable adjustment, inflation has collapsed, and we are getting to a point where inflation is low enough that they can actually start thinking about the next steps, which is removing some of these remaining capital controls and liberalising the currency regime, then eventually get an IMF programme which will have that as a condition.\u201d Isabelle Mateos Y Lago, chief economist at BNP Paribas, who has also worked at the IMF, is impressed at how the economy has performed. \u201cArgentina has made unexpectedly encouraging progress over the past year in turning its economy around,\u201d she says, adding that \u201ca gradual lifting of capital controls seems possible in 2025\u201d. Milei has vowed to lift capital controls, which are commonly referred to as \u201ccepo\u201d, or clamp in Spanish. These strict controls, which include forcing exporters to sell their dollars for pesos, have been in place for much of the past decade, to the dismay of investors and savers alike. However, lifting them prematurely risks unleashing a fresh wave of inflation that the government is already struggling to tame. Mateos Y Lago has faith that Milei will make progress on this goal. She says: \u201cDespite its chequered economic history, Argentina has many assets that international investors should be attracted to tap into. \u201cMoreover, in a world where international politics and economics are increasingly intertwined, proximity between President Milei and incoming President Trump should be an additional tailwind.\u201d The political winds may be blowing in Milei\u2019s favour, but it\u2019s clear that many economic challenges lie ahead.
