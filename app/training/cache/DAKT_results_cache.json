[{"text": "Anchor Capital Supports Governance Enhancements at Daktronics Business Wire Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 4:00 PM 1 min read BOSTON, MA, January 27, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Anchor Capital Advisors, LLC (collectively with its affiliates, \"Anchor Capital\"), which is a shareholder of Daktronics, Inc. (NASDAQ: DAKT) (\"Daktronics\" or the \"Company\"), today issued the following statement regarding its support of shareholder-driven governance enhancements at Daktronics: \"Anchor Capital appreciates the positive conversations we have had with Daktronics\u2019 management. We believe the Company, and its stakeholders, would greatly benefit from adding shareholder-supported board members, who would bring fresh perspectives to help address Daktronics\u2019 undervaluation. We would also support implementing a de-classified board structure in alignment with our proxy voting guidelines, and strong corporate governance. In our view, it is important that Daktronics remain incorporated in South Dakota at this time \u2013 and consider moving to Delaware at a later date \u2013 to allow for swift shareholder-driven governance enhancements. As a firm, we believe reincorporating right now would diminish the voices of non-insider shareholders and stymie progress for positive changes backed by a number of top shareholders. We view the proposed enhancements mentioned above as highly beneficial to the Company, aligned with shareholders and essential to Daktronics\u2019 long-term success.\" About Anchor Capital Advisors, LLC Founded in 1983 and based in Boston, Anchor Capital is a long-only, value-oriented investment management firm. Anchor Capital has assets under advisement of $5.0 billion and assets under management of $2.4 billion as of 12/31/2024.

(NASDAQ:DAKT) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 71% of the company editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 2:41 PM 4 min read In This Article: DAKT -2.13% Key Insights Institutions' substantial holdings in Daktronics implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price A total of 14 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Recent sales by insiders If you want to know who really controls Daktronics, Inc. ( NASDAQ:DAKT ), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 71% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk). Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Daktronics. See our latest analysis for Daktronics NasdaqGS:DAKT Ownership Breakdown January 22nd 2025 What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Daktronics? Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Daktronics. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Daktronics, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. NasdaqGS:DAKT Earnings and Revenue Growth January 22nd 2025 Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Daktronics. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc. with 6.7% of shares outstanding. Duquesne Family Office LLC is the second largest shareholder owning 5.5% of common stock, and Dimensional Fund Advisors LP holds about 5.4% of the company stock. Furthermore, CEO Reece Kurtenbach is the owner of 1.2% of the company's shares. Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 14 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership. Story Continues While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. While there is some analyst coverage, the company is probably not widely covered. So it could gain more attention, down the track. Insider Ownership Of Daktronics The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Daktronics, Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$782m, and insiders have US$69m worth of shares, in their own names. It is good to see some investment by insiders, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public Ownership The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 18% stake in Daktronics. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. Next Steps: It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Daktronics better, we need to consider many other factors.

Meeting of Shareholders Daktronics, Inc. Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 5:25 PM 8 min read In This Article: DAKT -2.13% Daktronics, Inc. Shareholders to Vote on a Proposal to Reincorporate the Company in Delaware Reaffirms Commitment to Maintaining Headquarters and Operations in South Dakota BROOKINGS, S.D., Jan. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Daktronics, Inc. (\u201cDaktronics,\u201d the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) (NASDAQ-DAKT), the leading U.S.-based designer and manufacturer of best-in-class dynamic video communication displays and control systems for customers worldwide, today announced that the Company has filed a preliminary proxy statement and plans to hold a special meeting of shareholders (the \u201cSpecial Meeting\u201d) to consider and vote upon a proposal to change the Company\u2019s jurisdiction of incorporation from South Dakota to Delaware. \u201cWe are proud of our long history in South Dakota and remain committed to maintaining our headquarters and operations in the state,\u201d said Reece Kurtenbach, Daktronics\u2019 Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. \u201cAs our business has grown and become more complex, we have come to recognize the importance of evolving our corporate governance structure. Delaware is the legal domicile for most large, publicly traded companies, and its corporate law is well understood, clear and predictable and provides strong shareholder rights and protections. We believe changing our legal domicile to Delaware \u2013 without making any other structural changes to our employee base, facilities, operations or commitments to our communities \u2013 supports our ongoing business transformation plan and enables us to enhance the rights of our shareholders while continuing to benefit from the exemplary work ethic and ingenuity of our South Dakota employees.\u201d Reincorporation will provide an opportunity for the Company to make corporate governance enhancements \u2013 including a majority voting standard for uncontested director elections, proxy access and a conventional, statutory voting system for director elections \u2013 which will ensure holders of the majority of shares are able to elect a cohesive Board of Directors and eliminate the risk that a minority group of shareholders can hand-pick a faction of directors they believe will represent their particular interests. South Dakota has been Daktronics\u2019 home since 1968, when the Company was founded by Drs. Aelred Kurtenbach and Duane Sander, two professors at South Dakota State University, to capitalize on engineering talent graduating in South Dakota. The Company has its roots in this mission, and Daktronics\u2019 growth from a small, local company to a world leader in the display industry has been fueled primarily by this talent pool as it has expanded into the global marketplace. Story Continues Today, more than half of the Company\u2019s nearly 3,000 employees work in South Dakota. Daktronics proudly ranks among South Dakota\u2019s largest employers and intends to continue to invest in its people and communities to maintain its strong presence in the state. Mr. Kurtenbach added, \u201cWhile Daktronics\u2019 legal jurisdiction may change, our home will not. Our corporate headquarters, along with important manufacturing, engineering, sales and service facilities and the vast majority of our employees, will remain in South Dakota, where we have been for more than 50 years.\u201d Further details about the Special Meeting will be included in the Company\u2019s definitive proxy materials to be distributed to all shareholders eligible to vote at the Special Meeting. The Company encourages all shareholders to carefully review those materials when they are available. If you have any questions or require any assistance with voting your shares, please contact our proxy solicitor, Alliance Advisors, LLC, at (833) 215-7293 or dakt@allianceadvisors.com.

"Netflix upgraded, Reddit downgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls The Fly Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 5:36 PM 4 min read In This Article: NFLX +0.22% RDDT +1.38% Netflix upgraded, Reddit downgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly. Top 5 Upgrades: Rosenblatt upgraded Netflix (NFLX) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $1,494, up from $680, after the company \"delivered on so many levels\" in Q4. Canaccord also upgraded Netflix to Buy from Hold with a price target of $1,150, up from $940, after the company reported strong Q4 results, with paid memberships, revenue, and profitability all coming in ahead of expectations. Meanwhile, Barclays upgraded Netflix to Equal Weight from Underweight with a price target of $900, up from $715, and Benchmark upgraded Netflix to Hold from Sell with no price target. Bernstein upgraded Darden (DRI) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $215, up from $180. After a \"dismal 2024, the restaurants sector looks relatively inexpensive,\" the firm tells investors in a research note, adding that Darden has upside from improvements in its core middle-income consumer cohort, rollout of UberDirect with marketing support, and efficiency measures supporting margin expansion. Wells Fargo upgraded 3M (MMM) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $170, up from $140. The company is in the \"early days of significant margin expansion\" at a time of uncertainty about the trajectory of an industrial recovery, which is attractive, the firm tells investors in a research note. Summit Insights upgraded Seagate (STX) to Buy from Hold. The firm is positive on the company's HAMR HDD technology transition driving upside to its gross margin in the second half of FY25, also noting that the current favorable pricing environment and product mix at Seagate will continue. Barclays upgraded Hormel Foods (HRL) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $36, up from $35. The firm sees the company's investments into its \"Transform and Modernize\" initiative materializing into a higher long-term margin structure. Top 5 Downgrades: Roth MKM downgraded Reddit (RDDT) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $195, up from $116. Given the rise in the share price, the firm believes the near-term risk/reward is fairly balanced at current levels.

A Reflection Of Its Financial Health? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sun, Jan 5, 2025, 5:33 PM 3 min read In This Article: DAKT -2.13% Daktronics' (NASDAQ:DAKT) stock is up by a considerable 29% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Daktronics' ROE today. Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Daktronics How Do You Calculate Return On Equity? ROE can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Daktronics is: 11% = US$30m \u00f7 US$261m (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2024). The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.11 in profit. What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth? Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics. Daktronics' Earnings Growth And 11% ROE To start with, Daktronics' ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 10%. This certainly adds some context to Daktronics' exceptional 48% net income growth seen over the past five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently. As a next step, we compared Daktronics' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 14%. NasdaqGS:DAKT Past Earnings Growth January 5th 2025 The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Daktronics fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide. Story Continues Is Daktronics Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits? Daktronics doesn't pay any regular dividends currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the high earnings growth number that we discussed above. Conclusion Overall, we are quite pleased with Daktronics' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate.

Research Wed, Dec 4, 2024, 4:40 PM 3 min read In This Article: DAKT -2.13% Daktronics (DAKT) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.08 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.17 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.28 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -52.94%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this video display maker would post earnings of $0.30 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.36, delivering a surprise of 20%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. Daktronics , which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Products industry, posted revenues of $208.33 million for the quarter ended October 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.17%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $199.37 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Daktronics shares have added about 92.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 26.8%. What's Next for Daktronics? While Daktronics has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Daktronics: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

{"text": "Daktronics' (NASDAQ:DAKT) Soft Earnings Are Actually Better Than They Appear editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sat, Dec 14, 2024, 4:49 PM 3 min read In This Article: DAKT -2.13% The market was pleased with the recent earnings report from Daktronics, Inc. ( NASDAQ:DAKT ), despite the profit numbers being soft. However, we think the company is showing some signs that things are more promising than they seem. See our latest analysis for Daktronics NasdaqGS:DAKT Earnings and Revenue History December 14th 2024 A Closer Look At Daktronics' Earnings As finance nerds would already know, the accrual ratio from cashflow is a key measure for assessing how well a company's free cash flow (FCF) matches its profit. The accrual ratio subtracts the FCF from the profit for a given period, and divides the result by the average operating assets of the company over that time. You could think of the accrual ratio from cashflow as the 'non-FCF profit ratio'. As a result, a negative accrual ratio is a positive for the company, and a positive accrual ratio is a negative. While it's not a problem to have a positive accrual ratio, indicating a certain level of non-cash profits, a high accrual ratio is arguably a bad thing, because it indicates paper profits are not matched by cash flow. To quote a 2014 paper by Lewellen and Resutek, \"firms with higher accruals tend to be less profitable in the future\". Daktronics has an accrual ratio of -0.17 for the year to October 2024. That indicates that its free cash flow quite significantly exceeded its statutory profit. Indeed, in the last twelve months it reported free cash flow of US$64m, well over the US$29.7m it reported in profit. Daktronics' year-on-year free cash flow was as flat as two-day-old fizzy drink. That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates. Our Take On Daktronics' Profit Performance Happily for shareholders, Daktronics produced plenty of free cash flow to back up its statutory profit numbers. Based on this observation, we consider it possible that Daktronics' statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! On the other hand, its EPS actually shrunk in the last twelve months. Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors. So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing. For example - Daktronics has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of. Today we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of Daktronics' profit. But there is always more to discover if you are capable of focussing your mind on minutiae. Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business.

Letter to Board of Daktronics Business Wire Tue, Dec 17, 2024, 4:52 PM 7 min read Expresses Support for Shareholder Alta Fox and Encourages Board to Act in Best Interests of ALL Shareholders Offers Recommendations to Improve the Company CHARLESTON, S.C., December 17, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Breach Inlet Capital, LP, an investment firm focused on underfollowed and misunderstood small cap equities, today issued the following letter to the Board of Directors of Daktronics, Inc. (NASDAQ: DAKT). The full text of the letter follows: December 17, 2024 Daktronics, Inc. 201 Daktronics Drive Brookings, South Dakota 57006 Attention: Board of Directors Dear Members of the Board: Breach Inlet Capital, LP (together with its affiliates, \"Breach Inlet Capital\" or \"we\") has been a patient and supportive shareholder of Daktronics, Inc. (\"DAKT\" or the \"Company\") for more than a year. Based on public information, we are a top 10 shareholder of the Company with ownership of nearly 2% of the outstanding shares, which is more than any of the Company\u2019s directors or executive officers. We have a history of constructively engaging public company boards to create value for shareholders, so we urge the Board of Directors (the \"Board\") to carefully read this letter and expeditiously enact our recommendations. Over the past six months, our concerns about the Board have grown. First, it is inexcusable that DAKT did not announce its search for a new CFO until nearly two years after DAKT\u2019s going concern notice. 1 Also, DAKT did not announce it had hired consultants to accelerate growth and improve margins 2 until after DAKT\u2019s revenue and margins began to fall in fiscal 1Q25. Further, after we pushed DAKT\u2019s leadership to provide long-term financial targets, these metrics were finally provided in February 2024. 3 However, the financial targets were vague and have not been formally reiterated, which renders those targets useless in our view. Most alarmingly, we have become concerned by the Board\u2019s public response to Alta Fox Capital Management, LLC (\"Alta Fox\"). Alta Fox is DAKT\u2019s largest equity holder and recently provided recommendations to enhance value for all shareholders. 4 We would like to remind the members of the Board that they have a fiduciary duty to all shareholders, not just the Kurtenbach Family. To be clear, we have no agreements, arrangements or understandings with Alta Fox regarding DAKT or any other company. But, as a concerned and unbiased shareholder, we thought it was necessary to express our agreement with Alta Fox\u2019s stated concerns regarding the Company\u2019s leadership, governance practices, and incentives. Story Continues In addition to the myriad of issues identified by Alta Fox, we want to highlight another example that supports the belief that the Board seems entrenched and beholden to the Kurtenbachs. In early May 2024 (four months before the Company\u2019s 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders), we emailed Lead Independent Director Andrew Siegel and Chairman/CEO Reece Kurtenbach to propose Glen Herrick as a Board nominee. During his 10+ year tenure as CFO of Pathward Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ: CASH) and despite three different CEOs, Mr. Herrick helped drive a ~15% EPS CAGR and ~15% annualized total shareholder return. In addition to his superb track record, Mr. Herrick resides in South Dakota (where DAKT is headquartered), is a former engineer with an operations mindset, and is a longtime DAKT shareholder who is passionate about seeing the Company be successful. In our view, Mr. Herrick is more qualified than any member of the current Board. DAKT informed us that Mr. Herrick would be fairly evaluated as a director candidate for the 2024 Annual Meeting. Instead, the Board waited until July 26 th to interview Mr. Herrick and the Company filed its proxy statement in connection with the 2024 Annual Meeting just 10 days later. At the end of that interview, Mr. Herrick was told that, \"Daktronics is simply getting to know potential candidates for future board openings and building a bench.\" Therefore, it appears the Board had no intention of seriously considering Mr. Herrick as a nominee at the 2024 Annual Meeting, despite telling us the contrary. Furthermore, Mr. Herrick contacted Chairman/CEO Kurtenbach and Secretary Carla Gatzke (who is also the sister of Chairman/CEO Kurtenbach) to offer himself for the open DAKT CFO position. He was thanked for his interest and told his resume would be submitted to the recruiting firm leading the CFO search. More than 7 weeks has passed since then, yet Mr. Herrick has not heard from the recruiting firm. Instead of fair consideration, it appears the Kurtenbachs have again rebuffed a highly-qualified candidate. We do not have confidence that the Board will select a CFO who is best for all shareholders. Adding to our concerns, members of DAKT management and the Board have sold or distributed a combined $19 million of stock in the past six months, which represents an estimated ~35% of their holdings. 5 If current leadership has so much confidence in its plan and the trajectory of the business, then why are they selling so much stock? Lastly, every member of the current Board (other than Howard Atkins) was on the Board when DAKT received the going concern notice. At that time and under their stewardship, the long-term viability of DAKT was in question. Thus, it gives us serious pause that the same Board is still leading DAKT today. Ironically, Alta Fox is the firm that potentially saved DAKT from bankruptcy. Now, the Board is wasting shareholder capital in a public feud with its largest investor. DAKT shareholders deserve much better. We implore the Board to immediately stop fighting with DAKT\u2019s shareholders and focus on its fiduciary duty, which is to maximize value for all shareholders. To reiterate, we agree with Alta Fox and expect that DAKT\u2019s non-insider shareholders share our views. We believe DAKT is a high-quality company that is severely undervalued because the Company is not being managed to maximize its potential. We believe it would be in the best interest of shareholders for the following changes to be implemented immediately: Declassify the Board. Reconstitute the Board with at least four shareholder-nominated directors. Separate the CEO and Chairman roles, while naming a shareholder-nominated director as the new Chairman. With the involvement of shareholder-nominated directors, attract a CFO with a proven track record in operational excellence and capital allocation. Issue annual guidance, which should provide specific ranges for Revenue, EBIT and adjusted EPS. Issue three-year targets, which should include the expected specific benefits from spending ~$10 million on consultants and the \"Digital Transformation\". Restructure executive compensation, which should include a greater mix of stock compensation and more stringent/updated criteria. Restructure the salesforce compensation, which should be more heavily weighted towards commissions and incentivizing outbound sales. With the refreshed Board and new CFO, develop and communicate a clear capital allocation plan. Remove the poison pill. We are happy to discuss our views in more detail with the Board. We look forward to your prompt response, which should be in a cooperative, not a combative, manner. In the absence of Board action, we plan to continue to make our voice heard to ensure the Board grasps the severity of the situation and the need to act in the best interests of all shareholders.

Positive Points Daktronics Inc ( NASDAQ:DAKT ) achieved sales growth in the first half of fiscal year 2025, marking a record quarter for cash generation. The company completed several high-profile installations, including projects for the LA Clippers and Miami Heat, showcasing their innovative LED technology. Daktronics Inc ( NASDAQ:DAKT ) reported strong cash flows from operations, totaling $43.3 million for the fiscal second quarter and $62.8 million for the first half of the year. The company is making significant progress on its digital transformation roadmap, including the launch of enterprise performance management tools. Daktronics Inc ( NASDAQ:DAKT ) is expanding its E-sales channel, which is expected to reduce selling costs and allow sales teams to focus on more complex, higher-value sales. Negative Points Order volume for the quarter declined, primarily due to decreases in live events, transportation, and international business units. Gross profit percentage slightly decreased compared to the previous year, reflecting sales mix differences. Operating expenses increased due to investments in staffing and consulting fees for digital transformation initiatives. The company anticipates a seasonally lower volume in the third quarter, which may impact operating margins. Tariffs and geopolitical uncertainties pose risks to the company's supply chain, particularly regarding semiconductor sourcing. Q & A Highlights Q : Given the strong second quarter results, do you expect a steeper decline in revenue for the second half of the fiscal year? A : Reece Kurtenbach, CEO, stated that while revenue can be lumpy due to the large project business, they expect overall orders and sales for the fiscal year to be on par or exceed last year's. Q : How should we think about gross margins for next year, considering the seasonal softness in the second half? A : Reece Kurtenbach, CEO, mentioned that the gross margins are more affected by volume rather than price compression. They are winning their fair share of orders at the current pricing. Story Continues Q : How is the E sales channel performing, and what impact will it have on margins? A : Reece Kurtenbach, CEO, explained that the E sales channel is growing, focusing on small, standard orders. This should reduce selling costs and allow sales teams to focus on higher-value sales, maintaining gross margins and improving efficiency. Q : Will consulting fees for digital transformation continue next year, and how will they affect margins? A : Reece Kurtenbach, CEO, noted that while the business transformation initiative should be contained this year, some digital transformation initiatives will continue into fiscal '26, potentially incurring additional consulting fees. Q : How might the new administration's approach to tariffs affect Daktronics? A : Reece Kurtenbach, CEO, stated that while it's difficult to predict specific actions, tariffs could impact products sourced from China, including semiconductors. However, most competitors also produce outside the U.S., so it may not be a competitive disadvantage.

{"text": "Daktronics, Inc. Announces 2025 Fiscal Second Quarter Results Daktronics, Inc. Wed, Dec 4, 2024, 3:30 PM 20 min read In This Article: DAKT -2.13% Daktronics, Inc. Generates Record Cash Flow on Strong Sales Growth BROOKINGS, S.D., Dec. 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Daktronics, Inc. (NASDAQ-DAKT), the leading U.S.-based designer and manufacturer of best-in-class dynamic video communication displays and control systems for customers worldwide, today reported results for its fiscal 2025 second quarter which ended October\u00a026, 2024. Fiscal Q2 2025 financial highlights include: Sales of $208.3 million, a 4.5 percent increase from the second quarter of fiscal 2024, and fiscal year-to-date sales of $434.4 million, up 0.6 percent compared with the same period last fiscal year Gross profit as a percentage of net sales of 26.8 percent, compared to 27.2 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, and the seventh sequential quarter with over a 24.5 percent gross profit, demonstrating the effectiveness of management's business improvement initiatives Operating income of $15.8 million, compared to $19.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024; operating income adjusted for consultant related expenses associated with business transformation initiatives was $19.1 million ( 1) Record cash flows from operations of $43.3\u00a0million for the fiscal second quarter and $62.8 million for the first six months of fiscal 2025 Product order backlog of $236.0 million ( 2) at October\u00a026, 2024, compared to $267.2 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and $306.9 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024 Product and service orders of $177.6 million ( 2) for the quarter, a decrease of 3.3 percent from the second quarter of 2024 and $353.8 million on a year-to-date basis, a year-to-date increase of 3.3 percent Net income for the quarter was $21.4 million, excluding the non-operating non-cash debt fair value adjustment and operating adjustment for consultant related expenses associated with business transformation initiatives, adjusted net income ( 1) was $13.9 million for the quarter Reece Kurtenbach, Daktronics\u02b9 Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \u201cWe delivered strong second fiscal quarter results and made steady progress on our recently announced strategic and digital transformation initiatives. We generated record cash flow from operations of $43.3\u00a0million, as our order backlog continued to be reduced in level and in relation to steady sales, reaching total cash flow from operations of $62.8 million for the first half of the year. We completed innovative and visually striking installations at the L.A. Clippers' Intuit Dome, the Miami HEAT's Kaseya Center that have both drawn attention in trade and social media. We also served other customers with the completion and update to the latest digital technologies at numerous college and high school sporting facilities and commercial locations.\u201d Story Continues (1) Adjusted operating income and adjusted net income is not a measure defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), to report our results exclusive of items that are non-recurring or not core to our operating business. We believe presenting this non-GAAP financial measurement provides investors with a consistent way to analyze our performance. For more information, see the supplemental calculation contained later in this release. (2) Orders and backlog metrics are not measures defined by GAAP, and our methodology for determining orders and backlog may vary from the methodology used by other companies in determining their orders and backlog amounts. For more information related to backlog, see Part I, Item 1. Business of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2024. Update on Business and Digital Transformation Kurtenbach added, \u201cWe continue to execute on our business transformation plan, the goal of which is to grow revenue faster than the Company\u2019s addressable market, expand operating margins, and generate returns on capital in the mid-to-high-teens and consistently above the Company\u2019s cost of capital. During the quarter we made significant progress in a number of areas, including enterprise management tools, new show control capability, and upgrades to service and systems maintenance solutions, which are set to go live in the second half of the fiscal year.\u201d Key components of this program include: Carefully allocating resources to end market segments, prioritizing investments in areas where Daktronics has clear advantages and opportunities for above market growth at acceptable margins Aligning product delivery with differing customer needs through a tiered product offering strategy with pricing aligned with value delivered Achieving higher profit by reducing product input costs and focusing on efficiency improvements in manufacturing operations Maximizing balance sheet efficiencies Refining our critical business and financial management practices, including product pricing, business planning, and incentive compensation to fully support our performance objectives. Update on CFO Search As previously disclosed on October 21, 2024, the Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) has initiated a search for a new Chief Financial Officer. The Board is continuing to make progress on this search effort and will provide an additional update when the Company has more to announce. Outlook Daktronics enters the third quarter of fiscal 2025 with order growth of 3.3 percent year-over-year, and continues to expect order volume to increase for the full fiscal year. The first half of the fiscal year is typically the highest-volume sales of the year, and are expected to be at normal \"seasonal\" levels for the remainder of fiscal 2025. Management continues to refine and execute its digital and strategic transformation initiatives and will continue to make disciplined investments through the rest of the fiscal year to strengthen Daktronics' business foundation for future profitability and sustainable returns. Second Quarter Results Orders for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased by 3.3 percent from the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Order volume for the quarter declined primarily due to an order decrease in the Live Events, Transportation and International business units. Variability in orders between periods is natural in these large project business areas and the time of year for sports projects. These declines were offset by large project bookings in the Spectacular niche, end of calendar year purchases by business unit relating to increasing adoption of video displays in this market. Orders for the first half of the year increased 3.3 percent. Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 increased by 4.5 percent as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The sales increase was driven by comparatively higher volumes in the Commercial, Live Events and Transportation business units offset by lower sales levels in the High School Park and Recreation and International business units. This mix difference is the result of variability of orders described above and because during fiscal 2024, the operating environment and supply chain stabilized. Daktronics was able to capitalize on its operational capacity investments to fill order backlog and return to more shorter delivery lead times, especially in the High School Park and Recreation market. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly to 26.8 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to 27.2 percent a year earlier. The decrease is partially attributable to a change in sales mix between periods. Operating expenses increased to $40.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to $34.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Increased operating expenses reflect investments in staffing resources to support information technology and digital transformation programs as well as sales team expansion to support opportunities for future growth. During the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company incurred $3.3\u00a0million of consultant related expenses associated with the previously announced strategic and digital transformation initiatives. The above changes resulted in an operating income percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 of 7.6 percent. Adjusted for consultant related expenses, operating income was 9.2 percent ( 1) as compared to 9.7 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in interest income, net for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the same period one year ago was primarily due to interest income earned on cash balances. For the quarter ended October\u00a026, 2024, the Company recorded $10.3 million of income for the non-cash change in fair value of a convertible note payable, which is accounted for under the fair value option. The effective income tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 produced an effective tax rate of 15.0 percent primarily due to the reduction of the convertible note fair value adjustment to expense that is not deductible for tax purposes in proportion to the period's increase in pre-tax income. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was 64.8 percent due to an increase in the fair value adjustment. Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Cash, restricted cash and marketable securities totaled $134.4 million at October\u00a026, 2024, and $65.4 million of total current and long-term debt was outstanding as of that date, which includes $38.1 million of face value and $27.8 million of adjustments to fair value, and is net of $0.5 million of debt issuance costs. There were no draw-downs on the asset-based revolving credit facility during the first six months of fiscal 2025, and $40.8 million was available to draw at October\u00a026, 2024. In the first six months of fiscal 2025, Daktronics generated $62.8 million of cash from operations and used $10.5 million for purchases of property and equipment. At the end of the fiscal 2025 second quarter, the working capital ratio was 2.3 to 1. Inventory levels dropped 11.9 percent since the end of the 2024 fiscal year on April 27, 2024. Management\u2019s focus remains on managing working capital through expected growth of the Company. As previously announced on November 11, 2024, the Company delivered to Alta Fox Opportunities Fund, LP (\"Alta Fox\") notice of the conversion of an initial $7.0 million in face value of the $25.0 million senior second lien secured promissory note (the \"Convertible Note\") held by Alta Fox into shares of the Company's common stock, with a conversion date of December 3, 2024. The Company intends to convert the remainder of the Convertible Note over the next several months, in tranches of up to $7.0 million in face value every 30 days, as provided for in the Convertible Note. The Company will issue and deliver shares when Alta Fox certifies the delivery of shares will not cause its ownership to exceed the \"Maximum Percentage\". On November 25, 2024, the Company received from Alta Fox a written notice to increase the Maximum Percentage to 14.99 percent. This increase from the in-effect 3.00 percent maximum ownership takes effect 61 days after receipt of notice. The Board\u2019s decision to initiate the conversion of the Convertible Note is consistent with the Company\u2019s ongoing focus on balance sheet optimization and cost efficiency and will save the Company approximately $5.2 million in interest expense over the remaining term of the Convertible Note. To help offset the share dilution that will result from the conversion of the Convertible Note into common stock, the Company intends to execute on its existing share repurchase authorization as soon as practicable.

The term free cash flow is not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") and is not a measure of operating income, cash flows from operating activities or other GAAP figures and should not be considered alternatives to those computations. Free cash flow is intended to provide information that may be useful for investors when assessing period to period results.

The term adjusted operating income is not defined under GAAP and is not a measure of operating income, cash flows from operating activities, or other GAAP figures and should not be considered alternatives to those computations. We define non-GAAP adjusted operating income as operating income plus consulting related expenses related to our business transformation initiatives. Management believes non-GAAP adjusted operating income is a useful indicator of our financial performance and our ability to generate cash flows from operations. Our definition of non-GAAP adjusted operating income may not be comparable to similarly titled definitions used by other companies. The table above reconciles non-GAAP adjusted operating income to comparable GAAP financial measures.

We disclose adjusted net income as a non-GAAP financial measurement in order to report our results exclusive of items that are non-recurring or not core to our operating business.

Anders Bylund, The Motley Fool Wed, Dec 4, 2024, 10:52 PM 3 min read In This Article: DAKT -2.13% Shares of Daktronics (NASDAQ: DAKT) surged higher on Wednesday, powered by an impressive earnings report. The stock rose as much as 21.3% in the early morning, settling back to a 14.1% gain by 1:35 p.m. ET. Daktronics' Q2 2025 by the numbers Fiscal second-quarter sales rose 4.5% year over year, landing at $208 million. Daktronics reported an adjusted net income of $13.9 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the period ended Oct. 26, matching the year-ago figure. Start Your Mornings Smarter!

Sign Up For Free \u00bb Wall Street doesn't always have consensus estimates for this hidden gem's upcoming results, and management doesn't provide guidance targets. The modest year-over-year sales increase and steady earnings per share may seem disappointing without that context, but it should be noted that the year-ago period was a soaring success. At the time, Daktronics was roaring back from slow orders in the deepest, darkest part of the inflation crisis. Annual comparisons were always going to be difficult, and Daktronics more than matched investors' expectations. The stock has now gained 147% over the last year. Business trends in fiscal year 2025 Daktronics' robust report showed a wide variety of sector-specific trends. Sales of live event signage rose 13% year over year while commercial signs, high school scoreboards, and transportation-related revenue held steady with single-digit revenue changes. Forward-looking orders add some nuance to Daktronics' revenue-generating project completions -- the commercial segment saw a 30% order increase in the first quarter while transportation orders came in 43% slower. Then again, the transportation segment is far smaller than commercial and live event signage, which accounted for 58% of total sales in the second quarter. Management doesn't do financial guidance, but CEO Reece Kurtenbach noted that the order volume should keep rising in 2025 and pave the way to strong revenue over the next couple of years. Daktronics has an order backlog of $317 million, up from $267 million in the previous quarter. The company is also knee-deep in an operating review and restructuring, which looks helpful so far but might have unexpected consequences over time. Daktronics is a potential turnaround story in the making. Should you invest $1,000 in Daktronics right now?

Regarding Daktronics\u2019 Misleading Statements Business Wire Thu, Dec 12, 2024, 12:30 AM 7 min read In This Article: DAKT -2.13% Publicly Clarifies Alta Fox\u2019s Stance on its Convertible Promissory Note Reiterates its Belief that Daktronics Can Achieve ~$40 Per Share and ~100% Upside Through Governance Reforms, Board Refreshment and Operational Excellence DALLAS, December 11, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Alta Fox Capital Management, LLC (together with its affiliates, \"Alta Fox\" or \"we\"), the largest shareholder of Daktronics, Inc. (NASDAQ: DAKT) (\"Daktronics\" or the \"Company\") based on its beneficial ownership interest on a fully converted basis of 11.7% of the outstanding shares, today issued the following statement to correct misleading claims from the Company regarding Alta Fox\u2019s motives and recent actions: \"Yesterday, we released a detailed presentation outlining the serious governance issues at Daktronics, including long-term underperformance during Chairman and CEO Reece Kurtenbach\u2019s tenure, a misalignment of interests between the Board of Directors (the \"Board\") and shareholders, and rampant nepotism in the executive ranks. Instead of responding to the governance concerns raised by its largest shareholder, Daktronics has tried to paint Alta Fox as a bloodthirsty creditor, somehow misaligned with Daktronics' equity investors. This is a weak argument that investors will not be duped into believing. Let us set the record straight: Alta Fox has an equity position in Daktronics worth nearly $114 million once converted, or 11.7% of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares. 1 To insinuate that we are not aligned with shareholders is absurd, considering we are the Company\u2019s largest shareholder and own ~5x the number of shares held by the entire Board. The Company neglects to mention that Alta Fox has sought further governance enhancements as part of any agreement to retire our convertible promissory note . Over the years, Daktronics has failed to take our shareholder-friendly recommendations and highly qualified director candidates seriously. Unfortunately, this is unsurprising for a Company that abides by worst-in-class governance practices, including a staggered Board, poison pill and nepotism. Despite its claims of engaging in good faith, the Company never presented us with any proposed framework or offer. The Company merely suggested retiring the note early, without specifying a value, which Alta Fox noted could be a way to avoid diluting existing shareholders. We have consistently been a better barometer of Daktronics\u2019 fair value than the current Board, and we would never accept a discount to what we believe the Company is worth. As a shareholder, we have an unassailable right to put up directors for election at an annual meeting and to call a special meeting of shareholders . The Company\u2019s claim in its December 11 th press release that we have tried to \"intimidate\" the Board by stating our intention to nominate highly qualified, independent director candidates is not only delusional, but also speaks to the Board\u2019s extreme level of entrenchment and the insular culture it has perpetuated. Counter to what Daktronics claims, Alta Fox\u2019s May 2023 post that stated our belief that shares could triple to ~$16.23 has proven prescient: Daktronics currently trades at ~$19. 2 In the 19 months since that post, we have continued to study the business and speak to industry experts and ex-employees. We now believe the Company\u2019s potential upside is far greater than we originally realized, and that Daktronics\u2019 significant governance discount can be addressed, as we highlighted in our December 10 th presentation. Perhaps this is news to the Board or its advisors, but facts and price targets can change over time. We clearly see more potential value in Daktronics than the current Board or management do . As outlined in our December 10 th presentation , we believe there is a path to achieving $40 per share and ~100% upside by FY28 through governance reforms, the addition of new directors who possess expertise in corporate governance and investor communication, and operational improvements. Story Continues It is disturbing to see Daktronics attempt to smear Alta Fox\u2019s reputation with other shareholders after we stepped in to provide necessary rescue capital to the Company in its time of need and have dedicated more than two years to patiently advocating for improvements to the Company\u2019s governance, financial management practices and performance. As much as the Daktronics Board may try to evade it, accountability is coming . Alta Fox intends to utilize our full voting power as equity investors to benefit all stakeholders. We look forward to providing shareholders an opportunity to elect highly qualified directors so that Daktronics can realize its full potential.\" *** Alta Fox encourages Daktronics stakeholders to visit www.FixDaktronics.com to learn more about our path to $40 per share and to sign up for updates regarding our efforts at the Company.

and Public Statements from Alta Fox Daktronics, Inc. Wed, Dec 11, 2024, 4:40 PM 4 min read In This Article: DAKT -2.13% Daktronics, Inc. Highlights Alta Fox\u2019s Self-Serving Campaign to Pressure the Daktronics Board into Taking Actions that Would Favor Alta Fox as a Creditor BROOKINGS, S.D., Dec. 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Daktronics, Inc. (\u201cDaktronics\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NASDAQ-DAKT), the leading U.S.-based designer and manufacturer of best-in-class dynamic video communication displays and control systems for customers worldwide, today issued the following statement regarding the recent press release and public comments from Alta Fox Capital Management, LLC (together with its affiliates, \u201cAlta Fox\u201d): In May 2023, after a competitive process with several potential financing providers, we sold $25 million of convertible debt to Alta Fox. At that time, Alta Fox stated on social media that Daktronics\u2019 stock \u201ccould triple\u201d to approximately $16.23 per share. 1 Since then, we have engaged extensively and in good faith with Alta Fox, including recently regarding Alta Fox\u2019s desire to accelerate the Company\u2019s repayment of this twenty-month-old convertible debt. In its most recent proposal, Alta Fox demanded that the Company retire the convertible debt at a price more than three times its face value and nearly 50% above its fair value. 2 On behalf of our shareholders and following consultation with its investment bankers, the Board rejected Alta Fox\u2019s proposal as too costly to common shareholders, and it stands by that decision. Alta Fox then tried to intimidate the Board by threatening to initiate specious litigation on three separate matters, call a special meeting of shareholders, and nominate candidates to replace directors at the Company\u2019s 2025 annual meeting of shareholders if the Board did not accept Alta Fox\u2019s buyout terms on the convertible note. Recognizing that those threats would not convince the Board to repurchase Alta Fox\u2019s debt at an unreasonable price, Alta Fox has now issued a press release and presentation rife with innuendo and misleading statements. Alta Fox\u2019s public communications yesterday are also concerning because they fail to disclose that Alta Fox has been seeking to secure an economic windfall for itself as a creditor of Daktronics at the expense of our common shareholders. The Board recognizes and embraces its role as fiduciaries and will not be pressured into a transaction that is not in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Company has made a counterproposal to Alta Fox that reflects the market value for Alta Fox\u2019s convertible note and remains willing to assist Alta Fox in gaining the liquidity it desires at a price that is fair to both Alta Fox and our shareholders. At the same time, the Company will remain focused on its business transformation plan. Story Continues Notably, after significant transformation efforts and record financial performance in Fiscal Year 2024, Daktronics\u2019 stock closed yesterday at a price of $19.24 per share, well above the price target Alta Fox itself set for the stock in May 2023.

Governance and a Private Family Business Mentality Have Driven Massive Underperformance for Shareholders Outlines a Clear Path to ~$40 Per Share and ~100% Upside Through Governance Reforms, Board Refreshment and Operational Excellence Plans to Nominate Highly Qualified, Independent Director Candidates for Election to the Company\u2019s Board Visit www.FixDaktronics.com to View the Presentation DALLAS, December 10, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Alta Fox Capital Management, LLC (together with its affiliates, \"Alta Fox\" or \"we\"), the largest shareholder of Daktronics, Inc. (NASDAQ: DAKT) (\"Daktronics\" or the \"Company\") based on its beneficial ownership interest on a fully converted basis of 11.7% of the outstanding shares, today released a presentation that details a clear path to unlocking the full potential of the Company. The presentation, a similar version of which was delivered by Alta Fox Founder and Managing Partner Connor Haley at the Bloomberg Activism Forum 2024, can be accessed at www.FixDaktronics.com . The \u2018Governance Discount\u2019 at Daktronics In the presentation, Alta Fox highlights its belief that Daktronics is a high-quality, secular growth business that remains severely undervalued today due to ineffective corporate governance. Despite the Company\u2019s position as an undisputed market leader with revenues fueled by the expanding sports and live events market, Daktronics\u2019 second-generation leadership under Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Reece Kurtenbach has driven a culture of complacency and nepotism that has resulted in significant long-term underperformance. During Mr. Kurtenbach\u2019s tenure as Chairman of the Board of Directors (the \"Board\"), shareholders have endured irresponsible financial stewardship, a significant trading discount to the Company\u2019s peer set and 195% underperformance versus the S&P 500. 1 The Board has failed to hold Mr. Kurtenbach and his family members accountable for their disappointing long-term performance and has enabled the Company\u2019s broken culture to go unfixed. Alta Fox, which currently holds ~5x the number of shares held by the entire Daktronics Board combined, believes shareholders cannot trust the current Board to act in their best interests, as evidenced by the Board\u2019s embrace of worst-in-class governance practices such as staggered director classes, a combined Chairman and Chief Executive Officer role, and a poison pill. The Board has allowed key management roles to be filled by relatives, with three of the Company\u2019s five named executive officers coming from the Kurtenbach family. 2 Story Continues A History of Constructive Collaboration Met with Resistance Alta Fox has consistently sought to collaborate with Daktronics to help the Company reach its full potential, only to be met with resistance at every turn. Long before Daktronics publicly disclosed its going-concern warning in December 2022, Alta Fox traveled to South Dakota to meet with management and proactively offer financing and guidance to address the Company\u2019s financial challenges. Unfortunately, management chose not to engage, forcing the Company into a crisis that ultimately resulted in a going-concern notice from its auditors and the need for rescue financing. While Alta Fox stepped in to provide that critical financing, this situation could have been entirely avoided had Daktronics\u2019 leadership worked with us proactively \u2013 not reactively. Despite Alta Fox's efforts to be constructive, Daktronics has continued to ignore our recommendations, including advice to engage a top-tier third-party investor relations firm to improve its narrative to the market \u2013 a story that remains confused and underwhelming. Examples of communication missteps abound: Instead of providing specific guidance, Daktronics has a history of using vague language around a generic plan to \"increase profit margins,\" positioning the Board and management to avoid accountability for failing to hit targets. Management cites margin and return on invested capital targets during earnings calls that fall below the Company\u2019s current performance levels, indicating that leadership lacks an understanding of its own metrics. In the Q2 FY25 earnings release, Daktronics failed to include a working link to the earnings call, leaving some investors scrambling for access. During the call itself, management referenced page numbers in its prepared remarks, despite the investor deck lacking any slide numbers. These recurring issues reflect a deeper problem: a Board with minimal equity ownership and little accountability, perpetuating a culture of complacency and neglect. While such a culture might be tolerable in a privately held family business, Daktronics is a public company with fiduciary responsibilities to its shareholders that demand higher standards. In our view, these are responsibilities that the Kurtenbach family and its preferred Board are failing to uphold. Alta Fox has consistently identified these inefficiencies and proposed solutions to address them. Despite these constructive efforts, Daktronics\u2019 leadership continues to resist meaningful change, prioritizing entrenchment over shareholders\u2019 long-term best interests. Alta Fox\u2019s Recommended Path to ~$40 Per Share Shareholders deserve better \u2013 and Alta Fox is committed to delivering positive change, even if it means nominating director candidates for election to the Board in 2025 and thereafter. By modernizing its governance and embracing public company governance norms, the Company can reignite consistent growth and sustained profitability and ultimately produce superior shareholder value. Alta Fox has outlined a highly credible path for Daktronics to achieve ~$1.88 in FY28 EPS, potentially resulting in a ~$40 per share price target. Alta Fox\u2019s proposed path includes: Collaborating with Shareholders on a Meaningful Board Refresh \u2013 Daktronics would benefit from working with shareholders to add new, highly qualified directors to the Board to address deep-rooted issues related to its governance, investor communication and engagement, and value creation efforts. Individuals added to the Board in recent years have failed to fix these issues. Alta Fox plans to nominate highly qualified, independent director candidates for election at the 2025 annual shareholder meeting, unless Daktronics embraces our recent recommendations. Instituting Modern Governance Practices \u2013 The Company\u2019s Board should immediately de-stagger, split the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, remove the poison pill and align management\u2019s compensation with share price outperformance. Recruiting a Highly Qualified Chief Financial Officer \u2013 In light of the Company\u2019s prior material weaknesses and going concern notice, the Board should prioritize the hiring of a Chief Financial Officer who possesses public company experience and a track record of success. Restoring Accountability for Management and Setting a Merit-Based Culture \u2013 The Board should establish a clear capital allocation framework that is aimed toward maximizing shareholder value and ensure management initiates short- and long-term guidance. By taking these steps, the Board can hold management accountable based on its ability to allocate capital and hit targets. This will also position Daktronics to be operated like a publicly traded company, rather than a private family business brimming with complacency, nepotism and a lack of sustained focus on creating shareholder value. Improving Investor Engagement \u2013 Daktronics should consistently participate in well-attended investor conferences and create a clear investor narrative aided by sufficient sell-side coverage. Of course, this will require hiring a Chief Financial Officer with credibility and public market experience.
