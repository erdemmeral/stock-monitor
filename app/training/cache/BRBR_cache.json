[{"text": "BellRing Brands (BRBR) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth Zacks Equity Research Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 6:00 PM 5 Minuten Lesezeit In diesem Artikel: BRBR RMD The market expects BellRing Brands (BRBR) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates. The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 3, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This nutritional supplements company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.47 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +9.3%. Revenues are expected to be $524.48 million, up 21.9% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change. Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction). The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Weiterlesen Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for BellRing Brands? For BellRing Brands, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.15%. On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4. So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that BellRing Brands will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue? While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that BellRing Brands would post earnings of $0.50 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.51, delivering a surprise of +2%. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times. Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. BellRing Brands doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release. Expected Results of an Industry Player Another stock from the Zacks Medical - Products industry, ResMed (RMD), is soon expected to post earnings of $2.29 per share for the quarter ended December 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +21.8%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.26 billion, up 8.5% from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for ResMed has been revised 0.2% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.52%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate. This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that ResMed will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.

Protein Momentum Likely to Fuel BellRing Brands' Q1 Earnings Zacks Equity Research Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 5:07 PM 5 min read In This Article: BRBR BellRing Brands, Inc. BRBR is set to release its first-quarter fiscal 2025\u00a0results on Feb. 3, after market close. Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar . The global convenient nutrition category leader posted adjusted earnings of 51 cents per share in the last reported quarter, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2%. The company topped earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 16.84%. BRBR\u2019s Q1 Estimates For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for BellRing\u2019s revenues is pegged at $524.5 million, indicating an increase of 21.9% from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s first-quarter fiscal 2025 EPS suggests a 9.3% increase to 47 cents. Estimate Revision Trend Ahead of BRBR\u2019s Q1 Earnings Estimates for BellRing\u2019s Q1 earnings have remained constant at 47 cents in the past 90 days. Let\u2019s briefly review the company\u2019s performance leading up to this announcement. Factors Shaping BRBR\u2019s Q1 Performance The company is expected to have sustained the strong momentum of fiscal 2024, which marked the second consecutive year of significantly outpacing long-term algorithm growth and posted double-digit growth for the past four years. This positive trend is expected to have continued in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by increasing household penetration and a higher buy rate. In addition, ongoing\u00a0strong macro trends like the mainstreaming of protein, the growing popularity of functional foods and beverages, and the continued rise in healthy convenient foods are expected to have supported in bolstering its future growth potential. Building on a stellar fiscal 2024, Premier Protein, BellRing\u2019s largest brand, likely witnessed strong volume growth for both RTD shakes and powders. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Premier shake consumption is expected to have been boosted by strength in mass, food and e-commerce channels, driven by higher velocities, feature and display activity, along with distribution expansion in mass and food. BellRing Brands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise BellRing Brands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise BellRing Brands Inc. price-eps-surprise | BellRing Brands Inc. Quote Premier Protein powder reached over $75 million in net sales last fiscal, and likely maintained its strong growth trajectory, with consumption increasing beyond strong velocities and distribution gains. Meanwhile, mainstream every day and Sports Nutrition RTD brands may have continued to drive the most event growth. Ready-to-mix sales likely benefited from incremental feature and display activity. Together, these factors are expected to have made a positive impact on BellRing\u2019s fiscal 2025 first-quarter revenues. Story Continues Additionally, the Dymatize brand is expected to have retained a strong foothold in the powder category, with stable household penetration and overall distribution levels. Strength in Dymatize\u2019s international business likely boosted the company\u2019s overall top line in the to-be-reported quarter. In the United States, BellRing may have further invested more resources into marketing and promotion for Dymatize, further strengthening its position in the sports nutrition category. Operationally, inflation in the input costs is likely to have affected the gross margin performance in first-quarter 2025. BellRing may have significantly ramped up advertising promotion expenditures from the comparable period, mainly from the kick-off of the Premier Protein nationwide campaign. This is likely to have weighed on the adjusted EBITDA margins.
