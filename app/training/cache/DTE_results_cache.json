reliability progress: Customers experienced a 70% improvement in time spent without power in 2024 GlobeNewswire \u00b7 GlobeNewswire Inc. DTE Energy Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 8:55 PM 3 min read In This Article: DTE +0.85% Detroit, Jan. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DTE Energy today reported the progress it made in 2024 in building a smarter, stronger, and more resilient electric grid for its customers. Due to the impact of enhanced work and increased investment in the electric grid, coupled with less extreme weather, DTE customers experienced a nearly 70% improvement in time spent without power between 2023 and 2024. \u201cWhen we invest, it works. Thanks to the combination of $1.5 billion of investment in the electric grid last year, coupled with less extreme weather, our customers experienced a significant improvement in electric reliability in 2024,\u201d said Matt Paul, president and chief operations officer, DTE Electric. \u201cOur work to build the electric grid of the future is showing results, but we have a lot of work ahead, and tremendous investment to be made, to achieve the sustained electric reliability improvements our customers demand and deserve.\u201d To make these improvements possible, DTE is focused on executing the company\u2019s four-point plan to build the grid of the future that includes transitioning to a smart grid, updating existing infrastructure, rebuilding significant portions of the grid and trimming and removing trees away from our lines. In 2024 the company made significant progress including: DTE accelerated its transition to smart grid technology with more than 450 new circuit automation devices commissioned in 2024. These devices, combined with a state-of-the-art operations center and additional investments in the field communications system, help to isolate outages and alert DTE\u2019s operations center when wires are down, so that crews can restore power more quickly. In 2024 alone, these smart grid devices helped customers avoid nearly 10,000 outages and 4 million minutes of power interruption and smart grid technologies, like automatic pole top switches, have already helped avoid more than 50,000 customer outages. Every year, these upgrades will continue to help us save money by reducing the frequency of outages and the costs of repairs even more. The company continued rebuilding significant sections of the grid, including the construction of new, modern substations and entirely upgraded circuits. DTE currently has 12 new substations in various levels of commissioning, including three that began construction late in 2024 DTE upgraded and improved existing infrastructure. In 2024, field crews inspected and made upgrades along more than 850 miles of electric lines (longer than the distance between New York City and Chicago) and replaced nearly 3,400 power poles. Story Continues Trees and branches contacting electric equipment account for half the time customers spend without power, and in 2024 DTE trimmed or removed more than 4,300 miles of trees (the distance between Miami and Anchorage) across the many communities the company serves. By the end of this year, DTE will have trimmed or removed trees from over 31,000 miles of overhead infrastructure over the last five years.

the Inauguration of Black Business Enterprise (BBE) Certification, Echoing Booker T. Washington's Legacy PR Newswire Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 3:15 PM 3 min read The National Business League Secures Historic USPTO Federal Trademark for Black Business Enterprise (BBE), Revolutionizing Economic Equity and Sovereignty for Black Entrepreneurs Globally TUSKEGEE, Ala. , Jan. 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- More than six decades or 61 years after the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Black communities remain tethered to systemic inequities. Today, the National Business League (NBL)\u00ae makes history by securing a USPTO Federal Trademark for the Black Business Enterprise (BBE)\u00ae Certification and Scorecard Program (Registration Nos. 98127825 and 98130839). This landmark initiative reclaims Booker T. Washington's vision of self-reliance and economic sovereignty. (PRNewsfoto/The National Business League) (PRNewsfoto/The National Business League) \"The time for waiting and pleading is over,\" declared Dr. Ken L. Harris , President and CEO of the NBL. \"Integration has failed to deliver economic justice for Black businesses and communities. DEI initiatives and affirmative action have fallen short, leaving us chained to systems that exclude and diminish us. The BBE Certification is our economic emancipation proclamation for the 21st century.\" Failed Promises of DEI and Economic Inclusion: Decades of systemic neglect and performative gestures have exposed the shortcomings of so-called inclusion initiatives: Legal Setbacks: The 2023 Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard and UNC decision dismantled race-based affirmative action, rendering DEI strategies ineffective. Empty Commitments: Corporations pledged over $200 billion for racial equity since 2020, yet the promises produced negligible results for Black businesses. Shrinking DEI Efforts: Political and corporate entities, alongside Black gatekeepers, have retreated into performative actions, abandoning real progress. Colonial Lexicon: Words like \"minority,\" \"marginalized,\" \"people of color,\" and \"disadvantaged\" perpetuate dependency. The BBE movement rejects these labels, embracing ownership, power, and autonomy. The BBE: Reclaiming Economic Power: Currently, Black businesses represent only 1% of certified minority firms, excluding them from more than $500 billion in public and private sector contracts. The BBE Certification transforms this dynamic with: Certification: Reserved for businesses with at least 51% Black ownership, prioritizing equity for Black entrepreneurs and honoring the $1.5 trillion in annual Black consumer spending power. Scorecard: A digital accountability tool ensuring corporations and government entities equitably spend with Black businesses. Proven Success: Piloted through the National Black Supplier Development Program, generating $150 million in contracts with corporations like Comerica Bank, Cummins, DTE Energy, Ford, GM, Lear, Magna, Stellantis and Toyota, Story Continues A Call to Action: The BBE Certification national launch will take place at the 125th Quasquicentennial National Black Business Conference in Atlanta , August 20\u201323, 2025, alongside the Black Economic Freedom Movement's Digitize 1 Million Black Businesses by 2028 Campaign. Dr. Harris challenges: \"We will no longer beg for seats at tables where Black enterprise is undervalued. We will build our own tables, anchored in ownership and self-reliance, working only with those who genuinely support Black economic freedom.\" About National Business League: Founded in 1900 by Booker T. Washington , the National Business League (NBL)\u00ae is the nation's oldest and largest trade organization committed to advancing economic equity for Black businesses.

Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 4:00 PM 6 min read In This Article: VSAT -4.05% Viasat will join other commercial companies supporting NASA with connectivity for future missions under the five-year indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity award CARLSBAD, Calif., Jan. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Viasat, Inc. (NASDAQ: VSAT), a global leader in satellite communications, announced today it was selected by NASA to support the agency\u2019s direct-to-Earth (DTE) capabilities via the Near Space Network (NSN) Services contract, part of a five-year multi-award indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract program with an option to extend five years at a total cumulative value of $4.82 billion. Viasat is one of four commercial companies NASA announced will receive Task Order awards under this initiative. Initially, Viasat will provide global ground segment support services to NASA missions, with the potential to provide additional services in the future. The NASA NSN Services contract will provide commercial ground and space relay services for future NASA missions from low Earth orbit (LEO) to two million kilometers from Earth. As part of the contract, Viasat\u2019s Defense and Advanced Technologies (DAT) business will join other commercial providers in supplying DTE connectivity to current and planned NASA space missions. In 2023, NASA reported it satisfies about 36% of its DTE services through commercial providers, leaving significant room to expand with the aim to fully use commercial DTE services for near-space missions. Viasat will support NASA communications with its global Viasat Real-Time Earth (RTE) Ground-Segment-as-a-Service (GSaaS) network, providing LEO missions with a resilient and high-throughput satellite to ground communications solution. Viasat has teamed with ATLAS Space Operations, leveraging their Freedom Ground Software as a Service and Global Federated Network, and the Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) to provide NASA with a modern, highly capable, and geographically diverse satellite ground network. The Viasat RTE network is capable of multi-gigabit per second downlinks over a hybrid network-of-networks with a footprint across six continents, allowing NASA to significantly increase its daily opportunities to downlink information and support the timely delivery of mission critical data. Viasat\u2019s integrated RTE network capability will offer modern ground advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cloud-based optimization, as well as the benefits of a resilient and scalable ground network solution. \u201cViasat is thrilled to be selected by NASA to support NSN Services for critical mission needs,\u201d said Kent Leka, Vice President and General Manager of Antenna Systems at Viasat. \u201cFrom its inception, the Viasat RTE ground service was designed to be a high throughput, scalable, and automated ground service for supporting the most critical and data intensive missions in space. Through our work with ATLAS Space Operations and the Alaska Satellite Facility, NASA will gain access to a cutting-edge communications solution that improves performance, significantly increases efficiencies over legacy systems, and provides a more cost-effective service for delivering mission data. We are excited to bring these advanced ground services forward to support NASA\u2019s evolving NSN Services requirements.\u201d Story Continues The Viasat network includes access to an existing global Ka-band network for remote sensing data, and future enhancements will enable the integration of Viasat\u2019s advanced space relay solutions for L-band and Ka-band. Viasat\u2019s multi-orbit space relay services are separately being demonstrated under the NASA Communications Services Project , which supports NASA\u2019s transition from its legacy Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS). In November 2024, the agency announced that the NSN will no longer onboard new TDRSS users and will support missions either through the network\u2019s existing DTE capabilities or commercial relay services. The NSN Services contract aligns with NASA\u2019s aim to identify and take advantage of available commercial capabilities to support mission communications and navigation requirements. By integrating additional commercial providers into the NSN, NASA can transport more science, tracking, telemetry and command data to support NASA\u2019s communications requirements for current and future missions.

Watchlist Today? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 2:38 PM 4 min read In This Article: DTE +0.85% For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street , 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should. If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in DTE Energy ( NYSE:DTE ). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide DTE Energy with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for DTE Energy How Quickly Is DTE Energy Increasing Earnings Per Share? The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Impressively, DTE Energy has grown EPS by 27% per year, compound, in the last three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming. Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Unfortunately, DTE Energy's revenue dropped 10% last year, but the silver lining is that EBIT margins improved from 15% to 18%. That falls short of ideal. The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart. NYSE:DTE Earnings and Revenue History January 21st 2025 Of course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for DTE Energy . Are DTE Energy Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders? Owing to the size of DTE Energy, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. With a whopping US$75m worth of shares as a group, insiders have plenty riding on the company's success. This would indicate that the goals of shareholders and management are one and the same. Story Continues While it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like DTE Energy, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$13m. The DTE Energy CEO received US$10m in compensation for the year ending December 2023. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies and seems pretty reasonable. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally. Is DTE Energy Worth Keeping An Eye On? You can't deny that DTE Energy has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. If you need more convincing beyond that EPS growth rate, don't forget about the reasonable remuneration and the high insider ownership. This may only be a fast rundown, but the key takeaway is that DTE Energy is worth keeping an eye on. Don't forget that there may still be risks. For instance, we've identified 2 warning signs for DTE Energy (1 is potentially serious) you should be aware of. There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by significant insider holdings.

Industry Leadership with Stellar Growth in 2024 PR Newswire Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 4:00 PM 4 min read Bolsters Leadership by Promoting Timothy Sulzer to Chief Product Officer, David Barton to Chief Technology Officer PHILADELPHIA , Jan. 21, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- ZeroEyes , the creators of the only AI-based gun detection video analytics platform that holds the full US Department of Homeland Security SAFETY Act Designation, today announced a successful 2024 highlighted by dramatic growth in protecting against gun violence in schools, communities and government. The company also announced the appointment of co-founder and former CTO, Timothy Sulzer , to Chief Product Officer. Replacing him as CTO will be David Barton , who previously served as the company's SVP of engineering. (PRNewsfoto/ZeroEyes) Within the past year, ZeroEyes tripled the size of its Operations Center (ZOC) at the company's Conshohocken, PA headquarters, enhancing operational efficiency and supporting a 36% increase in workforce. This expansion has enabled the company to further enrich its AI data and enhance its machine-learning capabilities. Furthermore, ZeroEyes achieved a 230% increase in partnerships through its Channel Partner Program (CPP), establishing close collaboration with leading innovators in the security technology industry. Exclusively, the company progressed beyond its previous DTE (Developmental Testing and Evaluation) Designation to earn full SAFETY Act Designation from the Department of Defense in 2024. This development eliminates the third-party liability of all ZeroEyes' customers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism when the platform is in use. Full Designation is granted only to technologies that have been thoroughly tested and proven their effectiveness in mitigating terrorism risks. Another significant milestone involved the launch of ZeroEyes One (ZEO), a proactive gun detection solution that supports micro-deployments ranging from 1-12 IP cameras. This new offering brings ZeroEyes' AI gun detection and intelligent situational awareness capabilities to small businesses and private residences. In 2025, Sulzer and Barton will work together to accelerate the company's expansion with additional strategic initiatives. As a ZeroEyes co-founder, Sulzer has played a key role in shaping product decisions and collaborating with engineers to develop the core technology. In his new role, he will work closely with customers to identify pain points and develop new features and products to improve usability and efficiency. Barton's expertise encompasses production engineering, R&D, computer vision, and visual processing technologies. Before joining ZeroEyes in 2022, he founded npArbor, Inc. and BartonLabs, LLC and held leadership roles at companies such as Biamp Systems, \u0113poch, Inc., HOSTS Learning, Splash Technology, Intel, and HP. Barton also served as a U.S. Marine in the United States Marine Corps (USMC). Story Continues \"ZeroEyes was founded with a clear mission: to save lives. Through relentless effort and innovation, we have become a leader in AI-powered gun detection, and the promotions of Barton and Sulzer will further strengthen our ability to stay at the forefront of this critical field,\" said Mike Lahiff , CEO and co-founder of ZeroEyes. \"I am incredibly proud of what we accomplished in 2024. Our exceptional growth and success have laid a strong foundation for delivering even more advanced and intelligent AI-driven security solutions in 2025.\" About ZeroEyes ZeroEyes delivers a proactive, human-verified AI gun detection software solution that integrates into existing digital security cameras and helps to mitigate mass shootings and gun-related violence by reducing response times, providing actionable intelligence with images, and delivering clarity among chaos \u2014 ultimately saving lives.

presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Chevron Corporation (c), Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) and QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM), as well as two micro-cap stocks CSP Inc. (CSPI) and AMCON Distributing Company (DIT).\u00a0 The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today. You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>> Global Weeky Ahead Discusses the key market moving developments this week. A New U.S. Presidency Begins: Global Week Ahead Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard While no earnings releases are scheduled for today on account of the MLK Day holiday, the rest of this week will see more than 100 companies report Q4 results, including 36 S&P 500 members. With results from 42 S&P 500 as of Friday, January 17th, we will have seen results from roughly 15% of the index's membership by the end of this week. Total earnings for the 42 index members that have reported results already are up +21.8% from the same period last year on +7.3% higher revenues, with 81% beating EPS estimates and 71.4% beating revenue estimates. This is a notably better showing from this group of 42 index members relative to what we have seen from this same group in other recent periods, particularly on the growth front. Looking at Q4 as a whole, combining the actual results from the 42 index members with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings are expected to be up +8.5% on +4.8% higher revenues. Featured Analyst Reports Chevron shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past six months (+8.1% vs. +0.8%). The company is a fully integrated energy firm, Chevron is positioned as one of the top global integrated oil firms, set for sustainable production growth, particularly due to its dominant position in the lucrative Permian Basin. Further, the planned acquisition of Hess Corporation is expected to significantly strengthen Chevron's presence in oil-rich Guyana. However, the company is grappling with high sensitivity to oil price fluctuations and relatively expensive valuation. Another concern is the sub-100% reserve replacement ratio, indicating challenges in replenishing produced energy. Considering all these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point. (You can read the full research report on Chevron here >>> ) Shares of Merck have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-17.2% vs. -3.4%). The company is facing generic competition for several drugs, rising competitive pressure on diabetes franchise and declining Gardasil sales in China may hurt the top line. There are concerns about Merck\u2019s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda\u2019s loss of exclusivity in 2028. Estimates have declined ahead of Q4 results. Merck has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarter. Nevertheless, Blockbuster drug, Keytruda, and new products have been driving Merck\u2019s sales. With continued label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to see continued growth. Animal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline and is investing in M&A activity to strengthen its pipeline. (You can read the full research report on Merck here >>> ) QUALCOMM shares have gained +13.2% over the past year against the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry\u2019s gain of +28.3%. The company is increasingly focusing on the seamless transition from a wireless communications firm for the mobile industry to a connected processor firm for the intelligent edge. With the accelerated rollout of 5G technology, it is benefiting from investments toward building a licensing program in mobile. Qualcomm received a favorable verdict in a legal dispute against Arm Holdings, allowing the company to continue developing high-performing, best-in-class products based on Oryon ARM-compliant custom CPUs. However, it faces stiff competition in the mobile phone chipset market. The majority of its customers include Chinese manufacturers, which further clouds the revenue-generating potential, owing to strained bilateral trade relationships with the United States. The high debt burden is a concern. (You can read the full research report on QUALCOMM here >>> ) Shares of CSP have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry over the past year (+45.1% vs. +2.9%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $160.59 million have ended fiscal 2024 with $30.6 million in cash, up from $25.2 million, enabling growth investments like AZT PROTECT and high-margin services while maintaining a debt-free balance sheet. Recurring revenue rose to 17% of sales, driven by managed services and cloud solutions. AZT PROTECT gains traction via Rockwell partnerships and major contracts, enhancing cybersecurity market positioning. Niche expansions in cruise and freightliner markets diversify revenue. Strategic shifts to high-margin offerings improve profitability, supported by partnerships and industry awards. However, CSP posted a $1.9 million operating loss, with rising SG&A costs and dependence on key customers adding revenue volatility. HPP segment revenue fell 40%, hurt by legacy product phase-outs. Scaling new products demands heavy investment, pressuring near-term results. (You can read the full research report on CSP here >>> ) AMCON Distributing\u2019s have underperformed the Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry over the past year (-39.5% vs. +68.4%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $81.41 million have reliance on declining cigarette sales, rising costs, regulatory risks and competitive pressures pose challenges. With $121.3 million in debt and increasing interest expenses, AMCON must navigate cost pressures to sustain growth. Nevertheless, AMCON's strategic acquisitions, including Arrowrock Supply, have expanded its distribution network to 14 centers across 34 states, enhancing reach to 8,000 retail locations and driving economies of scale, operational synergies, and revenue diversification. Fiscal 2024 wholesale revenue rose $171.6 million, driven by acquisitions and growth in alternative tobacco, confectionery, and foodservice categories. Its health and wellness retail segment benefits from rising demand for natural products, achieving a gross margin of 36.7% in fiscal 2024. Investments in logistics, including new facilities in Colorado and Missouri, bolster operational efficiency.

{"text": "Trump inauguration \u2013 how will it impact the markets? Douglas Blakey Mon, Jan 20, 2025, 2:35 PM 24 min read Business and consumer tax cuts will be welcomed by the banking sector-that is a safe enough forecast. One might even see earlier rate cuts than previously forecast. Trump inherits a strong economy. The main economic indicators are positive. The US consumer is resilient with sales, retail and housing data all strong. On the other hand, there is inevitable uncertainty given the unpredictability of President-elect Trump. Market commentators give their assessment on what one might expect to see as Trump is inaugurated, again. Cathie Wood, CEO, ARK Invest The Trump Administration is likely to convince Congress not only to preserve the tax cuts scheduled to expire by year-end, but also to cut other business and individual tax rates and deregulate industries in which large corporations have armed lobbyists and benefitted from \"regulatory capture\" at the expense of small- to mid-sized companies. As a result, the bull market in equities is likely to broaden out from just a few cash-rich, large cap stocks to a broad swath of stocks that have been hampered by the supply shocks, the record-breaking burst in interest rates, and the rolling recession that have characterized the last four years. The prospect of lower deficits should allay fears in the bond market, helping to relieve pressure on the 10-year Treasury bond yield and bring it to a level determined more purely by real GDP growth and inflation. The consensus view today is that rapid real growth will cause inflation; we believe that history suggests otherwise. Uncertainty during the transition could add to the wall of worry that has kept the markets on edge recently. Will tariffs trigger another bout with inflation? We think not: instead, those tariffs should be selective and incremental, their discrete effects ultimately displaced overwhelmingly by tax cuts, deregulation, and dollar appreciation. Indeed, we believe the market is likely to discount a successful Trump Administration, which could turn out to be one of the most successful administrations since the Reagan Revolution. George Vessey, Lead FX Strategist, Convera On growth data testing Sterling's nerve This week's labour market report and flash PMI data will test whether consumer spending is holding up despite high borrowing costs. If growth disappoints, expectations for earlier rate cuts could build, further weakening the pound. Sterling needs a U-turn in USD sentiment and some positive news regarding tariffs, although this remains a key source of uncertainty given the unpredictability of President-elect Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated today. Story Continues Boris Kovacevic, Global Macro Strategist, Convera On Fed patience meeting US economy's mixed signals Despite the improving inflation picture, the Fed is unlikely to rush into rate cuts, staying on hold at its 27-28 January meeting. The economy remains strong, supported by resilient consumers and better-than-expected retail sales, industrial production, and housing data. Optimism about the new administration\u2019s pro-growth policies may have added to the momentum behind the US economy lately, but challenges loom. Higher tariffs and potential deportations could create headwinds that test the economy\u2019s resilience in the months ahead. Scott Dawson, head of research, Derive.xyz BTC volatility and sentiment The crypto market is heating up for Trump\u2019s inauguration with signs of increased volatility and bullish sentiment across major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. BTC\u2019s at-the-money (ATM) 1 DTE implied volatility (IV) has risen sharply, climbing from 35% yesterday to 83.5% today. This surge reflects heightened expectations for market swings in the immediate aftermath of the inauguration. Meanwhile, the 7-day ATM IV has risen more modestly, from 62.2% to 73.3%, suggesting traders anticipate short-term price turbulence but steadier movement beyond the next week. The buildup in short-term BTC volatility highlights growing uncertainty and excitement as traders brace for potentially significant price movements tied to the inauguration. The positive launches of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA tokens over the weekend shows the crypto-friendly tone of the incoming administration, which could further boost sentiment in the space. BTC\u2019s 7-day skew has jumped from -3.25% on January 10, to +9.5%, signaling that calls are now trading at a premium to puts. This indicates increased demand for upside leverage, as traders position for a bullish market response. Meanwhile, the longer-dated skew has remained relatively stable at approximately 6%, indicating that the market maintains a generally positive outlook over the six-month horizon. Over the past 24 hours, approximately 54% of BTC premiums were spent on buying calls. This suggests traders are positioning for upside potential, while 32.4% of premiums were from calls sold, possibly reflecting an effort to capitalise on perceived overpricing in the market. Nigel Green, CEO, deVere Group With at least 100 executive orders reportedly ready for signing on his first day in office, the newly re-elected president will launch initiatives targeting trade tariffs, deregulation, and defense spending, which are likely to jolt markets and shape investor expectations over the coming months. Protectionist tariffs President Trump\u2019s commitment to reshaping global trade is expected to kick off with tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico. Reports suggest incremental hikes of up to 25% on trade with these nations will commence immediately. Trump\u2019s tariff plans, including broader duties of up to 20% on all imports, could significantly disrupt supply chains while stoking inflationary pressures. Investors in multinational corporations and export-heavy sectors should remain vigilant for shifts. The inflationary impact of these tariffs could push consumer prices higher, potentially forcing the Federal Reserve to reconsider its current rate path and implement additional interest rate hikes. Currency markets are already anticipating these dynamics, with the dollar likely to strengthen in the short term before facing depreciation as inflationary concerns deepen. Deregulation policies Deregulation is set to reignite the financial, energy and crypto sectors, with expectations that Trump will roll back many of the restrictions imposed during the Biden administration. Banking stocks, which rallied post-election, could see further gains as Wall Street prepares for a more business-friendly environment. Financial services firms, fossil fuel producers and digital assets like Bitcoin stand to benefit, with potential ripple effects across equities and credit markets. Defence spending surge Under Trump, defense budgets are anticipated to surge, giving rise to new opportunities in aerospace, cybersecurity, and logistics sectors. This increased spending may strengthen defense stocks, while potentially crowding out private investment in other sectors. Gold poised for gains Trump\u2019s sweeping policies are likely to ignite inflation, further bolstering the appeal of safe-haven assets such as gold. China\u2019s pivot toward gold and away from the dollar is set to exacerbate these trends, potentially leading to record highs in bullion prices. What this means for investors The next six months will be marked by uncertainty, with the interplay of protectionist policies, deregulation, and inflationary pressures dictating market moves. Strategic diversification and a focus on inflation-resistant assets could be key to safeguarding portfolios and seizing opportunities in the new economic reality. With Trump\u2019s economic vision underway, investors must prepare for a fast-changing landscape in the world\u2019s largest economy. Seeking tailored advice now is critical to capitalising on the turbulence and emerging opportunities. Daniel Casali, chief investment strategist, Evelyn Partners When you consider the impact on markets of potential policy changes from the incoming US president, the game of \u2018Top Trumps\u2019 could be an apt way to determine how investors should navigate the months ahead under the new US premier. First released more than 40 years ago, Top Trumps uses cards that contain a list of numerical data based on various themes, such as cars, boats and aircraft. The aim of the game is to beat your opponent\u2019s card by comparing values and using probabilities. Investors can take a similar approach in using financial and economic metrics to find the Top Trump market opportunities as Donald Trump takes office to become the 47th US President. Considering the post-pandemic recovery dynamics of the last few years, 2025 will see relatively solid global economic growth, policy easing and further technological innovation. On growth, Bloomberg\u2019s survey of economists forecast global real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to expand by 3% in 2025, roughly in line with the long-term average. Leading the way is the US economy, where president-elect Trump is likely to bring in tax cuts and introduce significant deregulation. While the start to the year was marked by a sell-off in Treasuries and UK gilts, better-than-expected inflation data on both sides of the pond has led to a rally in bonds on the day. The UK inflation data for December came in lower than forecast at 2.5%, and while the US monthly rate was in line with expectations, rising to 2.9% in December, the core number, which strips out more volatile items such as food and energy, came in slightly lower than expected. This may bode well for further rate cuts from both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England in the coming months. Vince Truong, American financial adviser and partner, GSB We\u2019re already seeing what the impact of the Trump administration will have on global markets. US equities are a whirlpool sucking assets away from other countries as market participants largely expect pro-growth policies in the US. This is one among other reasons why US equities outperformed last year, and especially post-election. Moreover, the US Dollar is strengthening as assets move into the US and trade in the US. It\u2019s also in anticipation of potentially higher tariffs, leading to higher inflation, leading to higher interest rates and thus a strong dollar. So, the market is frontrunning these events. For the US economy, in the near term, Trump\u2019s policies on lower corporate and individual taxes is pro-growth and should strengthen companies and households, especially those with assets, provided that the tariff policies are not too jarring or disruptive. The impact of higher tariffs on the investment markets will depend on how gradual and surgical they are. If they\u2019re a sudden sledgehammer, that will have at least a short-term negative impact, likely causing a dip or correction (5-10% drop). But if they are surgical, measured and gradual, then the impact should be nominal. As we don\u2019t know the nature of the tariffs it would be best to temper excitement during what will be a period of short-term volatility to better assess what actually gets enacted. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets, Hargreaves Lansdown The FTSE 100 has opened the week buoyed by positive winds and renewed investor enthusiasm. It is close to clinching a fresh intraday record. After reaching an all-time high on Friday there seems little to spark a pull-back, with US markets shut for Martin Luther King Day. However, all eyes will be on Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration later as the 47 th President of the United States and his comments are likely to hold sway on markets. In particular, there will be intense interest in any clues as to just how punishing tariffs could be during his term, and the knock-on effect for inflation and global trade. The pound has gained a little ground against the dollar, but it\u2019s still bumping around at $1.22, close to 15-month lows partly due to the enduring strength of the dollar. There\u2019s respite for the UK government in terms of its borrowing costs. With bets high that the Bank of England will plump for a rate cut in February, 10-year gilt yields have eased off to 4.6% - down from 4.9% less than a week ago. With the UK no longer in the eye of the storm when it comes to market turmoil, it\u2019s helping improve investor sentiment. The impact of Trump on gold Gold has gained ground amid the uncertainty about the outlook for the world economy with Donald Trump returning to the White House. It\u2019s currently trading above $2,700 per ounce, off its October highs but is gaining back some ground. Gold is shining as a \u2018safe haven\u2019 asset, with investors seeking shelter to weather the storm of unpredictability. There are concerns that widespread tariffs will push up US consumer prices, increase inflation, and lead to interest rates staying higher for longer. There are also risks that a strengthening dollar will lead to inflation being exported to other countries which import dollar denominated commodities. There is a possibility, however that global companies will lower prices to stay competitive in the US market, which could have a deflationary effect on some economies over the longer term. World leaders will be waiting on tenterhooks to find out whether rhetoric on the campaign trail will become reality once Donald Trump is back in the Oval Office. There will be plenty of tricky diplomatic tightropes being walked. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is thought to be eyeing up an early trade deal with the US, but he\u2019s likely to be lining up in a long queue. There are concerns that industries such as pharma, mining, fishing and the drinks industry could be affected. The impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs may be more minimal overall for the UK, given the majority of trade with the US is in services which are likely to be exempt from the bulk of planned new duties. However, finance, consulting, logistics or insurance firms for example could still be affected if they support the trade of goods around the world. The International Monetary Fund has warned about the risks to supply chains and global trade, with Canada, Mexico and China bracing for the worst initial effects. The impact of Trump on crypto With the writing on the wall so overwhelmingly pro-crypto as Trump returns to the White House, Bitcoin has surged again in value to a fresh record high. It jumped almost 7% to trade above $108,000. The crypto markets have been riding the FOMO waves, with speculators fearful of missing out on the euphoria sparked for coins and tokens. With both the President and the First Lady launching meme coins just before the inauguration, it's being taken as a sign that Trump\u2019s pledge to make the US the Bitcoin capital of the world will be honoured. Policy is expected to be outlined to make Bitcoin a strategic US asset and build up a reserve in the cryptocurrency. Detail is also expected about plans to increase US dominance in Bitcoin mining and gain greater access to the blockspace to increase transaction capacity for US individuals and companies. There are expectations that crypto will be brought more into the financial mainstream, with clearer rules about how individuals and firms can trade such assets. All these are high hopes, which just a few years ago looked \u2018pie in the sky\u2019 but now appear much closer to reality, given how Trump has turned such a cheerleader for crypto. Its creeping influence in the world of finance can\u2019t be ignored. Nevertheless, investors should be mindful of getting carried away in a wave of speculation, with money they can\u2019t afford to lose. Although institutional interest and expected changes in regulation are adding more legitimacy, it\u2019s still a highly volatile asset and has a history of dropping sharply after steep climbs. Rupert Thompson, Chief Economist at IBOSS, part of Kingswood Group Good news almost all round Global equities performed well last week, gaining around 2.4% and 2.8% in local currency and sterling terms respectively. This left markets up 1.8% year-to-date in local currency terms and a rather larger 4.3% in sterling terms as a result of a 2% fall in the pound. The UK and US led last week\u2019s rise with increases of around 3.3% in sterling terms. Bonds also had a good week 10-year US Treasury and UK gilt yields both declined around 0.15%, reversing much of their recent rise and leaving yields only slightly up on the end of last year. Treasuries and gilts duly returned 1.6% and 0.9% over the week, leaving them broadly flat on the year so far. To mix my metaphors, this decline in yields confirms that the recent sell-off in gilts was more a storm in a teacup than another Liz Truss moment. It would be nice to think the market gains last week were down to a ceasefire in Gaza finally being agreed but the reality was rather more prosaic - better than expected US inflation numbers and a strong start to the fourth quarter US earnings season. The core US inflation rate unexpectedly edged down in December to 3.2% from 3.3%. This was enough to soothe the inflation angst of recent weeks and allow markets to regain some hope that the Fed will be able to lower rates another 0.5% or so over the coming year, even if the next cut has to wait until the summer. US bank earnings beat forecasts Meanwhile, the big US banks kicked off the reporting season with a bumper set of results, on the back of buoyant trading and investment banking revenues, and the sector was up as much as 7% over the week. The good news this quarter should not be confined to the banks, with overall earnings of the S&P 500 forecast to be up 11% on a year earlier, up from 9% in the previous quarter. If earnings beat expectations, as conveniently they almost always do, this will mark the largest rise for three years. UK inflation inches down The UK also saw some good news last week, at least on the inflation front. Headline inflation edged lower to 2.5% in December and the more important core rate fell more than expected to 3.2% from 3.5%, with services inflation slowing significantly from 5.0% to 4.4%. However, a good part of this decline was down to a 20% fall over the month in airfares which tend to be erratic at this time of year. Unfortunately, the inflation news over coming months is unlikely to make such pleasant reading with both core and headline rates set to head higher again. Still, this should not prevent the Bank of England from lowering rates by a further 0.25% in February to 4.5%, particularly after last week\u2019s downbeat data on activity. Although UK GDP did edge up 0.1% in November, reversing its October fall, the bigger picture is that the economy has flatlined since the summer. We still expect growth to pick up again but this will require a rather cheerier consumer and there was little evidence of this in December which saw an unexpected fall in retail sales. Even so, there is rather more cheer at the moment in the UK than Germany which remains very much the sick man of Europe \u2013 not that we\u2019re included in that category any longer. German GDP contracted 0.2% in 2024, the second consecutive annual decline. The UK, by contrast, should manage a gain of 0.8% last year, which looks quite respectable as long as we don\u2019t cast our gaze across the Atlantic where US growth should be around 2.8%. If the official numbers are to be believed \u2013 the only problem being that most people don\u2019t - China is the place to go if one\u2019s looking for growth. Friday saw the reporting of a surprise rise in growth in the fourth quarter to 5.4% from 4.6%. This coincidentally just happened to leave the gain for the year as a whole at 5%, bang in line with the government\u2019s target. All the anecdotal evidence is that Chinese activity is considerably more depressed than these rather rosy numbers suggest. With Trump\u2019s plans to hike tariffs set to impose an additional drag on the economy, it makes it all the more necessary and likely that the Chinese authorities will follow through on their pledges to boost their support for the consumer. All eyes on Trump comments This coming week, President Trump\u2019s inauguration speech later today will be the big focus as investors will desperately search for clues as to which of his many pronouncements he is actually likely to implement. Other than that, Tuesday sees the release of UK labour market data and on Friday we have business confidence numbers for the US, UK and Europe as well as a Bank of Japan meeting which could see rates raised for the first time since July. Nick Wood, Head of Execution, MillTechFX At the start of 2025, the outlook for the dollar remains positive. Analysts had expected a dovish shift from the Fed in mid-to-late 2024, decreasing the attractiveness of dollar-denominated investments and opening the door for other global currencies to gain against the greenback. However, this was not the case, primarily due to upcoming Trump policies and a hawkish re-pricing of the Fed which is reflected by the market currently expecting just a further 50bps of rate cuts and this differentiation vis-\u00e0-vis other major central banks has caused the dollar to rally against its G10 peers. This sustained strength has caused issues for North American corporates, 93% of whom reported that it had weakened their company\u2019s position in economic markets. The dollar looks like it should stay stronger for longer, with Donald Trump now taking office. Despite his vocal preference for a weaker currency, his proposed policies tell a different story. Introducing tariffs on imports and resetting the macroeconomic framework to achieve a looser fiscal policy may in-turn lead to tighter monetary policy which will likely cause a further strengthening of the dollar. Even more recently, the soon-to-be Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent opined that \u2018a 10% tariff hike means 4% currency gains\u2019 for the dollar. Needless to say, some of this will already have been reflected in the DXY strength, but not all. The risk is that the US dollar \u2013 which is expensive already \u2013 becomes more obviously overvalued, increasing the risk of global financial instability. Daniele Antonucci, chief investment officer, Quintet Private Bank Tariffs could be enacted as soon as today, with Donald Trump expected to sign executive orders after taking office. We think tariffs are likely to be a negotiation tool rather than a goal. After all, Trump\u2019s negotiation strategies, outlined in his book The Art of the Deal, emphasise boldness, preparation, leverage, publicity, and persistence. Moreover, with a more pro-business team than in Trump\u2019s first term, the policy tone may be more balanced but still driven by \u201cAmerica First.\u201d Raising tariffs too quickly risks stalling growth with rising prices, countering Trump\u2019s goals to boost growth and control inflation. The inflationary impact will depend on tariff size and scope. High US reliance on imports suggests tariffs may be inflationary. The effect could be offset if domestic industries absorb the costs. However, it\u2019s worth noting that a strong US dollar reduces import expenses. While tariffs may have a neutral impact on the US economy, they could strain relations with affected countries like China, Mexico, Canada, and Europe, and are likely to be negative for these economies. Due to the risk of tariff rises, we don\u2019t hold any tactical positions in European or emerging market equities. We\u2019ve also adjusted the protection against equity drawdowns in Europe we\u2019ve held, to increase the reactivity to these potential negative events the European equity market faces over the short term. From an investment perspective, we maintain an equity overweight, with a preference for US equities. Still-strong US growth supported by an AI investment cycle and the Fed rate cuts are positive catalysts. Meanwhile, risks of higher inflation made us swap shorter-dated inflation-protected bonds with longer-dated ones. The US dollar performed well in late 2024 relative to the euro and pound sterling, thanks to the strong US economy and expectations of Trump\u2019s election win. Markets believe his policies will boost growth, especially compared to the weaker Eurozone and UK. This has driven demand for the dollar, with many positive developments already factored in, while negative news is priced into the euro and pound sterling. As a result, a stronger dollar versus these other currencies has been a popular trade. However, while dollar strength in the near term is our base case, the risk is that this might not last throughout 2025. We think the dollar is currently overvalued and overbought, and Trump may face challenges in fully delivering his growth and inflation promises. Even with scaled-back policies, a larger fiscal deficit is likely, which could weaken the dollar at longer horizons. If Trump fully implements his agenda, it might put even more downside pressure on the US currency. Meanwhile, Europe\u2019s situation could surprise us. With expectations already low, there is room for better-than-expected outcomes. In particular, the Eurozone economies are especially competitive against the strong US dollar, and the euro is near its 2022 lows despite no energy crisis. The political uncertainty in Europe may also ease. In Germany, a grand coalition could slightly relax strict fiscal rules. France\u2019s situation is less clear, but fiscal consolidation could be delayed, supporting growth. In short, the US dollar may stay strong in the short term but give back some value as 2025 progresses. At the same time, the euro might gain from improving conditions and reduced uncertainty. This sets the stage for a shift in currency dynamics (with the pound sterling moving more sideways at this stage). But the balance of risks remains in favour of a strong US dollar. Nina Stanojevic, senior investment specialist, St. James\u2019s Place As the upcoming presidential inauguration approaches, we recognise the significance of this transition and its potential impact on the markets and economy. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the future direction of the new administration, investors should avoid making any immediate portfolio adjustments in response to this political development. Historically, markets have shown resilience across political transitions. Reacting to short-term political shifts introduces unnecessary risk and often undermines long-term returns. Investors should remain disciplined and avoid reactionary moves that could detract from sustained growth. Key developments that could shape the economic and market landscape Policy Direction and Fiscal Stimulus: We\u2019re watching for clarity on fiscal policies, infrastructure spending, and tax reforms, which could impact different market sectors and economic growth. Regulatory Changes : Adjustments in regulatory frameworks, especially in technology, healthcare, and energy, could create both risks and opportunities for investors. Global Trade Relations: Shifts in international trade policies will be critical in assessing global market dynamics and supply chain impacts. Economic Recovery and Inflation Trends: Post-pandemic recovery, labour market health, and inflationary pressures remain key factors in our outlook. Monetary Policy: The Federal Reserve\u2019s approach to interest rates has the potential to influence market performance. Within this environment, we see compelling opportunities in historically underperforming asset classes like small-cap stocks and emerging market equities. Small caps are trading at exceptionally low valuations, which places them in a positive position for strong rebounds. Similarly, EM equities are poised for growth, with compelling valuations supported by structural trends such as urbanisation and favourable demographics. Additionally, bonds continue to offer attractive yields and defensive qualities, serving as a vital counterbalance to equities amid market uncertainty and volatility. As the new administration begins its term, the potential for unexpected policy shifts and geopolitical developments increases the risk of extreme market events. In this environment, broad diversification should remain a cornerstone strategy \u2013 not just for protection against volatility but also for capturing mispriced investment opportunities that support long-term growth. Seamus Rocca, chief executive officer, Xapo Bank As we approach President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, the Bitcoin community is eager to see how he delivers on his bold message from Bitcoin Nashville\u2014that the US should be embracing this transformative industry. Trump\u2019s acknowledgement of Bitcoin\u2019s potential and his calls for American leadership in the space have sparked renewed optimism across the market. 2025 is shaping up to be an exciting year for crypto, with the US facing a pivotal moment. The market is keenly watching for progress not just on regulatory clarity but also on how the administration might view Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. These moves could redefine the US\u2019s position in the global digital asset landscape. With Europe leading the way through frameworks like MiCA, the US has some catching up to do. The first 100 days of this administration will be critical in laying the groundwork for common-sense regulation that supports innovation and strengthens Bitcoin\u2019s role in the financial ecosystem. We\u2019re looking forward to seeing how the US can capitalise on this moment and lead the charge toward a Bitcoin-powered future. \"Trump inauguration \u2013 how will it impact the markets?\" was originally created and published by Retail Banker International , a GlobalData owned brand.
