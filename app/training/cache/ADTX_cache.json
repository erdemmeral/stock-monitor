[{"text": "LIVE The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs Aditxt\u2019s Board of Directors Unanimously Approve Positioning Pearsanta for IPO to Support Global Launch of its Early Cancer Detection Platform Business Wire Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 4:15 PM 5 min read In This Article: ADTX +2.61% MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., January 13, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Aditxt, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADTX) (\"Aditxt\" or the \"Company\"), a social innovation platform dedicated to accelerating promising health innovations, is pleased to announce that its Board of Directors has authorized management to explore taking its subsidiary, Pearsanta, Inc. (\"Pearsanta\"), public via a proposed initial public offering (\"IPO\") in 2025. This decision aligns with Aditxt's mission to secure and develop transformative health innovations, positioning them for accelerated growth and broader market impact. Pearsanta, a precision diagnostic company, has advanced its development and operational capabilities, particularly in early cancer detection, by leveraging its proprietary Mitomic \u00ae Technology platform. The proposed Pearsanta IPO is intended to provide critical resources to accelerate Pearsanta\u2019s growth and expand its market presence. \"Cancer remains to be one of humanities biggest health challenges. Pearsanta\u2019s launch of its Mitomic \u00ae Technology platform for the early detection of cancer, reflects our commitment to identifying, developing and accelerating some of the most promising health innovations,\" said Amro Albanna, Co-Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Aditxt. \"The Board\u2019s authorization to explore this path is a key first step in positioning Pearsanta for a successful global launch.\" \"The proposed IPO marks a transformative moment for Pearsanta as we seek to bring our groundbreaking Mitomic\u00ae Technology platform to the global stage. We believe this milestone will enable us to accelerate the commercialization of our early cancer detection solutions, empowering clinicians with tools for earlier and more accurate diagnoses,\" said Chris Mitton, President of Pearsanta. \"Our focus remains on addressing critical unmet needs in healthcare, and this step is intended to position us to make a meaningful impact in the fight against cancer worldwide.\" About Aditxt Aditxt, Inc.\u00ae is a social innovation platform dedicated to accelerating promising health innovations. Aditxt\u2019s ecosystem of research institutions, industry partners, and shareholders collaboratively drives their mission to \"Make Promising Innovations Possible Together.\" The innovation platform is the cornerstone of Aditxt\u2019s strategy, where multiple disciplines drive disruptive growth and address significant societal challenges. Aditxt operates a unique model that democratizes innovation, ensures every stakeholder\u2019s voice is heard and valued, and empowers collective progress. Story Continues Aditxt currently operates two programs focused on immune health and precision health. The Company plans to introduce two additional programs dedicated to public health and women\u2019s health. For these, Aditxt has entered into an Arrangement Agreement with Appili Therapeutics, Inc. (\"Appili\") (TSX: APLI; OTCPink: APLIF), which focuses on infectious diseases, and a Merger Agreement with Evofem Biosciences, Inc. (\"Evofem\") (OTCQB: EVFM). Each program will be designed to function autonomously while collectively advancing Aditxt\u2019s mission of discovering, developing, and deploying innovative health solutions to tackle some of the most urgent health challenges. The closing of each of the transactions with Appili and Evofem is subject to several conditions, including but not limited to approval of the transactions by the respective target shareholders and Aditxt raising sufficient capital to fund its obligations at closing. These obligations include cash payments of approximately $17 million for Appili and $17 million for Evofem, which includes approximately $15.2 million required to satisfy Evofem's senior secured noteholder; should Aditxt fail to secure these funds, Evofem's senior secured noteholder is expected to seek to prevent the closing of the merger with Evofem. On December 23, 2024, Evofem announced the cancellation of its special stockholders meeting and the withdrawal of the merger proposal with Aditxt from consideration by the stockholders. No assurance can be provided that all of the conditions to closing will be obtained or satisfied or that either of the transactions will ultimately close. For more information, www.aditxt.com .

-13.87% ADTX +2.61% EVFM -6.12% Submission for Regulatory Approval to Initiate Human Trials for Type 1 Diabetes, Psoriasis, and Stiff-Person Syndrome Targeted for H2 2025 MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., December 12, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Aditxt, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADTX) (\"Aditxt\" or the \"Company\"), a social innovation platform dedicated to accelerating promising health innovations, today announced that its subsidiary, Adimune, Inc. (\"Adimune\"), has successfully completed all preclinical efficacy and safety studies for its antigen-specific gene therapy, ADI-100. This achievement represents a major milestone as Adimune prepares to submit a Clinical Trial Application (CTA)/Investigational New Drug (IND) application to initiate first-in-human clinical trials for ADI-100 in the treatment of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), Psoriasis, and in collaboration with Mayo Clinic, Stiff-Person Syndrome (SPS). Preclinical Data Highlight: Antigen specific immune tolerization without impairment of the overall immune responsiveness: ADI-100 is an innovative immune modulation therapy designed to restore immune tolerance in autoimmune diseases and induce tolerance for transplanted organs by leveraging the body\u2019s natural immune homeostasis mechanisms. Preclinical studies demonstrated the therapy's potential to achieve antigen-specific tolerization without impairing the immune system's ability to fight infections or to suppress tumor growth. In preclinical models, ADI-100 demonstrated efficacy in reversing hyperglycemia in Type 1 Diabetes, restoring islet cell mass, and transferring protective immune modulation to animals that were not treated with ADI-100. In separate preclinical experiments ADI-100 did not show any impairment of immune responses to infections or tumor growth. In Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice (prone to spontaneous type 1 diabetes) treated with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors, which markedly hastened disease progression, ADI-100 prevented hyperglycemia in 70% of treated mice and provided durable protection lasting over 300 days. In a study conducted using tumor bearing mice, ADI-100 did not impede the ability of the checkpoint inhibitor, anti-PD1, to shrink the tumor. Preclinical toxicology data confirmed the therapy\u2019s safety, with no detectable persistence of plasmids in tissues and organs, no formation of anti-plasmid antibodies, and no significant adverse effects. Advancing Toward IND Submission: Adimune has successfully completed all preclinical efficacy and safety studies for ADI-100, with GMP drug substances manufactured and stability studies underway. These steps position ADI-100 for first-in-human clinical trials, marking a significant milestone in transforming the treatment landscape for autoimmune diseases. Continua a leggere Dr. Friedrich Kapp, Co-CEO of Adimune commented, \"The treatment of autoimmune diseases will see a fundamental change in the next few years, a paradigm shift, which has been awaited since the processes were understood by which immune tolerance normally is being maintained. Restoring immune tolerance will replace immunosuppressants in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, and insulin eventually will become a mere rescue medication in type 1 diabetes. With the recent deal between Roche/Genentech and Cour on autoimmune treatments, the race is on and will be won by the drug which best fulfils three main criteria: safety, effectiveness, and durability of response. Adimune\u2019s ADI-100 is well positioned in this competitive endeavor. We are one of the front runners because we believe our drug candidate will meet all three criteria in a perfect manner.\" The autoimmune disease market represents a significant and growing unmet medical sector, with a total addressable market (TAM) of $84.12 billion. Autoimmune diseases affect approximately 8% of the U.S. population, with prevalence increasing year over year. Recent industry developments underscore the demand for innovative therapies in this space. Adimune\u2019s ADI-100 stands out in this competitive landscape with its innovative mechanism of action, broad therapeutic potential, and very strong preclinical data. Amro Albanna, Co-Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Aditxt and Co-CEO of Adimune, added, \"Adimune represents an opportunity for a fundamental shift in the way we treat autoimmunity where reliance on immunosuppressants could be reduced or eliminated. With the successful completion of ADI-100\u2019s preclinical efficacy and safety study, Adimune is closer to bringing this therapy to human trials advancing its mission of addressing autoimmune diseases as one of the most pressing health challenges we face.\" About ADI-100 ADI-100 is an innovative antigen-specific gene therapy that consists of two DNA molecules designed to restore immune tolerance in autoimmune diseases or to induce tolerance to transplanted organs. This approach should retrain the immune system to recognize antigens as \"self\" without relying on immunosuppression, offering the possibility of significant safety and efficacy benefits. The therapy consists of a pro-apoptotic DNA molecule (BAX), which has been shown in preclinical models to induce localized apoptotic cell death combined with a methylated sGAD55 DNA molecule that encodes a modified form of GAD to retrain the immune system to become tolerant to the antigen. ADI-100 is designed to work through precision immune reprogramming, downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines while upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines in an antigen-specific manner. It tolerizes to GAD, which is a target of autoimmunity, directly or indirectly involved in Type 1 Diabetes, Psoriasis, and certain CNS autoimmune disorders. In the mouse model for type 1 diabetes, ADI-100 demonstrated a reduction in the number of aggressive T cells directed against insulin, which is another antigen in the pancreas that is a target of autoimmune attack. This bystander effect is an important factor to counteract a phenomenon often observed where autoimmunity spreads to other regions of a protein or to other proteins in a cell. Another potential benefit of downregulating anti-GAD antibodies by ADI-100 is restoration of GABA levels, further enhancing the tolerization process.

(NASDAQ: ADTX) (\"Aditxt\" or the \"Company\"), a social innovation platform dedicated to accelerating promising health innovations, announced today that its acquisition target, Evofem Biosciences, Inc. (\"Evofem\") (OTCQB: EVFM), has secured voting agreements with certain of its investors to ensure they will vote in favor of the merger proposal at Evofem\u2019s upcoming Special Meeting of Stockholders (the \"Special Meeting\"). \"We believe that the proposed merger represents a compelling opportunity to accelerate Evofem\u2019s growth trajectory in women\u2019s sexual and reproductive health as a subsidiary of Aditxt,\" said Saundra Pelletier, CEO of Evofem. \"We are making steady progress towards completing this transaction, which will establish Aditxt\u2019s women\u2019s health mission,\" said Amro Albanna, Chairman, Co-Founder, and CEO of Aditxt. \"With Aditxt\u2019s final pre-merger equity investment completed last week, we believe that these voting agreements are critical in ensuring that Evofem reaches a quorum at its upcoming special meeting and we hope it will lead to a successful passage of the merger proposal.\" Under the voting agreements, certain holders of Evofem\u2019s Series E-1 Convertible Preferred Stock have agreed to vote the voting power of their shares, and certain holders of Evofem\u2019s Convertible Notes have agreed to vote any Evofem common stock they hold as of the record date for the Special Meeting, in favor of the merger proposal. Per the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement, as amended (the \"A&R Merger Agreement\"), between the companies, Aditxt\u2019s subsidiary Adifem, Inc. is expected to merge with and into Evofem, with Evofem remaining as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of Aditxt. The closing of the transactions is subject to several conditions, including approval of the transactions by a majority of the combined voting power of Evofem\u2019s E-1 and Common Stock, voting together as a single class, at a meeting where quorum is present, and Aditxt raising sufficient capital to fund its obligations prior to and at closing. On October 28, 2024, Aditxt invested $2.28 million in Evofem through the purchase of Evofem Series F-1 convertible preferred stock. This was the final pre-merger equity investment stipulated under the A&R Merger Agreement. During its virtual stakeholder update on November 1, 2024, Aditxt discussed its current non-compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s minimum bid price requirement and its expectation that it would be eligible for an additional 180 calendar days to regain compliance if its common stock closes below $1.00 for thirty consecutive days. As of the date of this release, Aditxt\u2019s common stock has closed below $1.00 for 10 consecutive trading days. Aditxt is hereby clarifying such statement that it may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar days to regain compliance if it meets all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company remains subject to a Nasdaq Panel Monitor until December 29, 2024. Story Continues About Aditxt, Inc.

Each program will be designed to function autonomously while collectively advancing Aditxt\u2019s mission of discovering, developing, and deploying innovative health solutions to tackle some of the most urgent health challenges. The closing of each of the transactions with Appili and Evofem is subject to several conditions, including but not limited to approval of the transactions by the respective target shareholders and Aditxt raising sufficient capital to fund its obligations at the closings of the respective transactions, which will require cash payments in the amounts of approximately $17 million and approximately $17 million (which includes approximately $15.2 million to satisfy certain senior indebtedness of Evofem), respectively. No assurance can be provided that all of the conditions to closing will be obtained or satisfied or that either of the transactions will ultimately close. For more information, www.aditxt.com .

of the ELOC and ATM, will be suspended during the stale period beginning Monday, November 11, 2024 MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., November 08, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Aditxt, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADTX) (\"Aditxt\" or the \"Company\"), a social innovation platform dedicated to accelerating promising health innovations, today provided an update to its shareholders on the utilization of its Equity Line of Credit (\"ELOC\") and At-the-Market (\"ATM\") facility, as well as its outstanding number of shares. Equity Issuance Update as of End of Day November 7, 2024: Total number of shares traded since ELOC and ATM Activation: 153,085,471 Total number of shares sold via ELOC and ATM: 11,920,744, representing approximately 8% of total traded shares since the ELOC and ATM initiation Total Outstanding Shares: 12,059,043 In addition, Aditxt announces that its use of the Shelf registration statement, inclusive of the ELOC and ATM, will be suspended during the stale period beginning Monday, November 11, 2024. This suspension will remain in effect at least until Aditxt, Appili Therapeutics, Inc., and Evofem Biosciences, Inc. complete their respective quarterly filings, and Aditxt has filed updated pro-forma financial statements with respect to such proposed acquisitions. Aditxt is also actively pursuing debt as the primary method of financing to meet the capital requirements for its acquisition strategy, thereby minimizing reliance on equity-based financing. By prioritizing debt, Aditxt intends to limit dilution and continue delivering value to shareholders while positioning the company for growth. Aditxt remains committed to transparent communication regarding its capital structure and financing strategy to keep stakeholders informed on developments impacting shareholder value. Disclaimer The above represents usage of the ELOC and ATM facilities to date, but is not necessarily indicative of future usage. Aditxt can provide no assurance that future usage will be consistent with its usage to date. We cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts, or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders and the issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. The sale of additional equity or convertible securities may dilute our existing stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations, and we may be required to agree to certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Story Continues About Aditxt, Inc. Aditxt, Inc.\u00ae is a social innovation platform dedicated to accelerating promising health innovations. Aditxt\u2019s ecosystem of research institutions, industry partners, and shareholders collaboratively drives their mission to \"Make Promising Innovations Possible Together.\" The innovation platform is the cornerstone of Aditxt\u2019s strategy, where multiple disciplines drive disruptive growth and address significant societal challenges. Aditxt operates a unique model that democratizes innovation, ensures every stakeholder\u2019s voice is heard and valued, and empowers collective progress. Aditxt currently operates two programs focused on immune health and precision health. The Company plans to introduce two additional programs dedicated to public health and women\u2019s health. For these, Aditxt has entered into an Arrangement Agreement with Appili Therapeutics, Inc. (\"Appili\") (TSX: APLI; OTCPink: APLIF), which focuses on infectious diseases, and a Merger Agreement with Evofem Biosciences, Inc. (\"Evofem\") (OTCQB: EVFM). Each program will be designed to function autonomously while collectively advancing Aditxt\u2019s mission of discovering, developing, and deploying innovative health solutions to tackle some of the most urgent health challenges. The closing of each of the transactions with Appili and Evofem is subject to several conditions, including but not limited to approval of the transactions by the respective target shareholders and Aditxt raising sufficient capital to fund its obligations at closing. These obligations include cash payments of approximately $17 million for Appili and $17 million for Evofem, which includes approximately $15.2 million required to satisfy Evofem's senior secured noteholder; should Aditxt fail to secure these funds, Evofem's senior secured noteholder is expected to seek to prevent the closing of the merger with Evofem. No assurance can be provided that all of the conditions to closing will be obtained or satisfied or that either of the transactions will ultimately close. For more information, www.aditxt.com .

Newswire Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 4:00 PM 5 min read In This Article: EVFM -6.12% ADTX +2.61% SAN DIEGO , Nov. 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Evofem Biosciences, Inc. (OTCQB: EVFM) (\"Evofem\" or the \"Company\")\u00a0today announced it has secured voting agreements with certain of its Series E-1 stockholders and convertible noteholders to ensure they will vote in favor of the proposed merger with Aditxt, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADTX) (\"Aditxt\") subsidiary Adifem, Inc., under the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement , as amended (the \"A&R Merger Agreement), at Evofem's upcoming Special Meeting of Stockholders (the \"Meeting\"). Women's health innovator Evofem Biosciences (OTCQB: EVFM) (PRNewsfoto/Evofem Biosciences, Inc.) Under the voting agreements, certain holders of Evofem's Series E-1 Convertible Preferred Stock have agreed to vote the voting power of their shares, and certain holders of Evofem's Convertible Notes have agreed to vote any EVFM common stock they hold as of the record date for the Special Meeting, in favor of the merger proposal. The voting agreements follow Aditxt's $2.28 million investment in Evofem last week through the purchase of Evofem Series F-1 convertible preferred stock (the \"Preferred Investment\"). This was the final investment stipulated under the A&R Merger Agreement. Aditxt has completed $5.0 million in Preferred Investments since May 2024 , meeting its commitments under the A&R Merger Agreement. \"The Capital we received from Aditxt since May\u00a0enabled us to acquire SOLOSEC\u00ae, the single dose oral antibiotic FDA-approved to treat bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis, and to fuel our initiatives to drive uptake of Phexxi\u00ae among GLP-1 users whose concomitant use of oral contraceptives puts them at risk for unplanned pregnancy,\" said Saundra Pelletier , CEO of Evofem. \"We look forward to further support from Aditxt and its ecosystem as we work to catalyze our growth trajectory and execute our mission to improve women's lives through diversified and differentiated diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic offerings.\" \"With the support of our stockholders, including the investors who have committed to vote \"for\" the Merger Agreement under these voting agreements, we hope to gain approval of the Merger at our Special Meeting of Stockholders and to close shortly thereafter, assuming closing conditions are met,\" Ms. Pelletier added. Closing conditions to the merger include, among others, the affirmative vote of a majority of the combined voting power of the outstanding shares of Evofem common stock and Series E-1, voting together as a single class as of the Record Date, at a meeting at which a quorum is present and Aditxt raising sufficient capital to fund its obligations at closing, which will require cash payments of approximately $17 million . This includes the approximately $15.2 million required to satisfy Evofem's senior secured noteholder; should Aditxt fail to secure these funds, Evofem's senior secured noteholder is expected to block the closing of this merger. No assurance can be provided that all conditions to closing will be obtained or satisfied or that the transaction will ultimately close. Story Continues Evofem plans to file an amended preliminary proxy related to the merger in the near future. About Evofem Biosciences, Inc.

(\"Evofem\" or \"the Company\") (OTCQB: EVFM) today announced financial results for the third quarter and nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 . Highlights include: Women's health innovator Evofem Biosciences (OTCQB: EVFM) (PRNewsfoto/Evofem Biosciences, Inc.) Acquired global rights to SOLOSEC\u00ae (secnidazole) 2g oral granules , a single-dose oral antibiotic FDA approved to treat bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis, two common sexual health infections. Licensed Phexxi\u00ae (lactic acid, citric acid and potassium bitartrate) commercial rights in the Middle East to Emirati pharmaceutical company Pharma 1 Drug Store. The regulatory submission for the hormone-free contraceptive is on track for submission to the UAE Ministry of Health by year-end 2024. Launched a Market Development Collaboration with\u00a0Pearsanta focused on its blood-based diagnostic test for endometriosis, a chronic disease associated with severe, life-impacting pain that affects approximately one in ten women of reproductive age. Improved loss from operations to $2.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, versus a loss from operations of $3.6 million in the prior year quarter. Aditxt, Inc . (Nasdaq: ADTX) has invested $5.0 million in Evofem since May 2024 , including $1.3 million from the sale of Series F-1 Preferred Stock to Aditxt in the third quarter of 2024 and $2.7 million in October 2024 .

On November 8 , 2024,\u00a0Evofem remedied its prior bid price deficiency and regained compliance with the OTCQB Standards for Continued Eligibility. \"We continue to advance Evofem's strategy to grow revenues organically and through strategic acquisitions and alliances,\" said Saundra Pelletier , CEO of Evofem Biosciences. \"In the third quarter we closed several business development transactions that we expect will diversify and strengthen our revenue streams. We acquired and recently relaunched SOLOSEC as the only single-dose oral treatment FDA-approved for both bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis. We also forged an agreement that paves the way for the commercialization of\u00a0Phexxi in the GCC, starting with the UAE. In addition, we launched a market development collaboration with Pearsanta, a subsidiary of Aditxt, for its endometriosis diagnostic. Further post-merger support from Aditxt and its ecosystem should help catalyze our growth trajectory and our ability to execute our mission to improve women's lives through diversified and differentiated diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic offerings.\" Story Continues Financial Results For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , net product sales were $4.5 million compared to $5.1 million in the prior year period. The 12% decrease primarily reflects lower unit sales in the current period due to the impact of the continued absence of marketing, partially offset by the Phexxi WAC increase in January 2024 and a slight decrease in variable consideration. Total operating expenses were $6.9 million , a decrease of 20% compared to\u00a0the prior\u00a0year period. Selling and marketing costs were $2.4 million , a decrease of 20% compared to the prior year quarter. General and administrative costs were $3.1 million , a decrease of 4% compared to the prior year quarter. Research and development costs were $0.3 million , a decrease of 46% compared to the prior year quarter. Cost of goods sold (COGS) were $0.9 million , a 54% decrease compared to the prior year period primarily due to the lower product sales and the absence of re-packaging costs in the current year quarter. As a result, operating loss improved to $2.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to an operating loss of $3 .6\u00a0million in the third quarter of 2023. Factoring in a $0.1 million gain in other income, net loss attributable to common stockholders was $2.4 million , or a loss of $0.02 per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 . This compares to net income attributable to common shareholders of $66.0 million , or $15.34 per share, for the prior year quarter, which reflects a $75.3 million gain related to the Baker Fourth Amendment, which was treated as a debt extinguishment, offset in part by a $5.3 million loss on the quarterly valuation of the senior subordinated convertible notes and purchase rights and warrant modifications, and $0.5 million of interest expense related to the Adjuvant Note. Liquidity In the third quarter of 2024, Evofem raised $1.3 million in aggregate net proceeds through the sale and issuance of 1,260 shares of Series F-1 Convertible Preferred Stock to Aditxt pursuant to the A&R Merger Agreement. At September 30, 2024 , the Company had $0.7 million of restricted cash, as compared to $0.6 million of restricted cash at December 31 , 2023. In October 2024 , Evofem raised $2.7 million in aggregate net proceeds through the sale and issuance of 2,740 shares of Series F-1 Convertible Preferred Stock to Aditxt pursuant to the A&R Merger Agreement. Evofem used a portion of this funding to pay in full its obligations to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. About Evofem Biosciences Evofem Biosciences, Inc ., is commercializing innovative products to address unmet needs in women's sexual and reproductive health. The Company's first FDA-approved product, Phexxi \u00ae (lactic acid, citric acid and potassium bitartrate) , is a\u00a0hormone-free, on-demand prescription contraceptive vaginal gel. It comes in a box of 12 pre-filled applicators and is applied 0-60 minutes before each act of sex. In July 2024 Evofem broadened its commercial offering with the acquisition of SOLOSEC\u00ae (secnidazole) 2g oral granules , an FDA-approved oral antibiotic\u00a0for the treatment of two sexual health diseases: bacterial vaginosis (BV), a common vaginal infection, in females 12 years of age and older, and trichomoniasis, a common sexually transmitted infection (STI), in people 12 years of age and older. SOLOSEC provides a complete course of therapy in just one dose. In\u00a0December 2023, Evofem entered into a Merger Agreement with Aditxt, Inc. (Nasdaq: ADTX) under which Aditxt's subsidiary Adifem, Inc. is expected to merge with and into Evofem, with Evofem remaining as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of Aditxt. The companies amended and restated the Merger Agreement, as amended (the \"A&R Merger Agreement\"), in its entirety in\u00a0July 2024. The A&R Merger Agreement was subsequently amended in August, September, and October 2024 , primarily to adjust investment dates. The closing of the transactions is subject to several conditions, including approval of the transactions by a majority of the combined voting power of Evofem's E-1 and Common Stock, voting together as a single class, at a meeting where quorum is present, and Aditxt raising sufficient capital to fund its obligations prior to and at closing.

Therapeutics Inc. Thu, Nov 14, 2024, 3:15 PM 6 min read In This Article: APLIF -13.87% ADTX +2.61% Appili Therapeutics Inc. Overwhelming shareholder support in favour of take-private transaction with Aditxt Studies presented at IDWeek 2024\u2122 demonstrate ATI-1701 provides full protection against lethal tularemia in animal models after one year Alignment with U.S. Food and Drug Administration on development requirements for ATI-1801 NDA Submission HALIFAX, Nova Scotia, Nov. 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Appili Therapeutics Inc. (TSX:APLI; OTCPink: APLIF) (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cAppili\u201d), a biopharmaceutical company focused on drug development for infectious diseases and medical countermeasures, today announced its financial and operational results for the second quarter of its fiscal year 2025, which ended on September 30, 2024. All figures are stated in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated. \u201cDuring fiscal year 2025, Appili shareholders voted overwhelmingly in favor of the transaction with Aditxt, facilitating our access to capital and activating promising opportunities for Appili,\u201d said Dr. Don Cilla, President and CEO of Appili. \u201cThe shareholder vote is an important milestone for Appili and brings us one step closer to \u2018 Making Promising Innovations Possible Together \u2019 through Aditxt\u2019s social incubator platform.\u201d ATI-1701, Biodefense Vaccine Candidate with Strong U.S. Air Force Academy Funding Commitments ATI-1701, a novel live-attenuated vaccine for preventing F. tularensis , has previously secured US$14 million in awards from the United States Air Force Academy (\u201cUSAFA\u201d) . Under the cooperative agreement with USAFA, Appili manages a comprehensive development program, including nonclinical studies, CMC/manufacturing, clinical preparatory, and regulatory activities supporting an IND submission in 2025. Recent data presented by Appili's scientific team at the Military Health System Research Symposium and IDWeek 2024\u2122 demonstrated strong efficacy results. Studies showed that a single dose of ATI-1701 provided full protection against lethal tularemia in animal models, with protection for one year after vaccination. Additional research highlighted the heightened risk of tularemia outbreaks in conflict zones and positioned ATI-1701 as a potentially valuable tool in protecting warfighters. Appili has recently had positive interactions with the United States Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) in the form of a pre-IND meeting, confirming the development pathway for the majority of Appili\u2019s proposed development plan. Appili is currently in the process of implementing suggested changes in its development effort. ATI-1801, Demonstrated safety and efficacy across multiple Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies ATI-1801, a novel topical formulation of paromomycin (15% w/w), is under advanced clinical development for treating cutaneous leishmaniasis, a disfiguring skin infection affecting hundreds of thousands globally. Story Continues In a recent response to Appili\u2019s Type B meeting request, the FDA agreed with the Company\u2019s proposed strategy to establish a scientific bridge between previous clinical trial material and new drug product batches. The approach enables Appili to leverage key results from the clinical dossier for ATI-1801 licensed from U.S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity, including the successful results of a Phase 3 study, and allows the completion of an New Drug Application much sooner than if additional clinical data were required. ATI-1801 has received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for certain forms of cutaneous leishmaniasis. The company is evaluating ATI-1801\u2019s eligibility for a priority review voucher (\u201cPRV\u201d), which, if confirmed, would make it the second PRV-eligible program at Appili, alongside ATI-1701, which is potentially eligible for a PRV pending renewal of certain U.S. legislation. LIKMEZ\u2122 (ATI-1501), FDA Approved Liquid Oral Reformulation of the Antibiotic Metronidazole In September 2023, Appili, together with its U.S. partner, Saptalis Pharmaceuticals LLC., announced the approval by the FDA of LIKMEZ\u2122 (ATI-1501), LIKMEZ\u00ae is the first and only FDA-approved liquid formulation of metronidazole providing a novel prescribing option for patients with difficulty swallowing or experiencing taste-related hurdles. LIKMEZ, with patent coverage through 2039, addresses the unmet need in patients with dysphagia to avoid risks associated with drug compounding, and discontinuation related anti-microbial resistance. In November 2023, Saptalis, through a commercialization partner, launched LIKMEZ in the U.S. and the product is now available to patients and doctors. Appili earned milestone payments from Saptalis and is entitled to receive additional sales-based milestone payments and royalties from Saptalis based on sale of the product. Saptalis is currently in the process of identifying an alternative commercialization partner. Aditxt Arrangement On November 6, 2024, shareholders of the Company overwhelmingly voted in favour of a special resolution approving a plan of arrangement pursuant to which Aditxt Inc. (NASDAQ:ADTX) (\u201cAditxt\u201d), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Adivir, Inc. will acquire all of the issued and outstanding Class A common shares of the Company by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) (the \u201cTransaction\u201d). Approximately 29.50% of the outstanding Appili Shares were voted by shareholders and the Transaction was approved by 99.79% of the votes cast. For further details regarding the Transaction, please see Appili\u2019s press release dated April 2, 2024 and Appili\u2019s management information circular (the \u201cCircular\u201d) dated October 4, 2024, a copy of which is available under Appili\u2019s profile on SEDAR+ (sedarplus.ca). Appili and Aditxt are in the process of satisfying the remaining closing conditions, which include: (1) the Company obtaining final court approval for the Transaction, and (2) Aditxt securing sufficient financing to complete the Transaction. Subject to satisfaction or waiver of the remaining closing conditions, Appili expects the Transaction to close in December 2024. Financial Results The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standard Board and Part I of Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada Handbook\u2013Accounting. All figures are stated in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated.
