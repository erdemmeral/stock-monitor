Stock? Zacks Equity Research Mon, Jan 20, 2025, 8:00 PM 3 min read In This Article: EB -1.58% Eventbrite (EB) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices. The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system. The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Eventbrite is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price. Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock. For Eventbrite, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher. Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>. Story Continues Earnings Estimate Revisions for Eventbrite This company is expected to earn -$0.12 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2024, which represents a year-over-year change of 53.9%. Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Eventbrite. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 89.8%. Bottom Line Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term. You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>> The upgrade of Eventbrite to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.

to Eventbrite Stock Despite Its 54% Dip in a Year? Zacks Equity Research Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 7:41 PM 4 min read In This Article: EB -1.58% Eventbrite EB shares saw a sharp decline of 53.9% in the trailing 12 months, significantly underperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s appreciation of 29.4% and the Zacks Internet - Software industry\u2019s 32.7% jump. This underperformance has resulted from weakening financial performance and operational challenges. The company has struggled with declining engagement from its user base, making it difficult to sustain growth in ticket sales and event creation. Operating inefficiencies and rising costs have added to its financial pressures. Increasing competition in the event management and ticketing industries has intensified, putting additional pressure on the company\u2019s market share. Despite challenges, Eventbrite is optimistic about its growth potential. The company is focusing on expanding its event inventory to attract more creators and engage consumers, with $4.5 million in new bookings in the third quarter of 2024. Significant pipeline improvements across music, food and drink, and comedy shows are expected to drive top-line growth in the long term. Eventbrite, Inc. Price and Consensus Eventbrite, Inc. Price and Consensus Eventbrite, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Eventbrite, Inc. Quote Enhanced Platform & New Creators Drive EB Growth Creator acquisition is a cornerstone of Eventbrite's growth strategy, driving an increase in event listings, ticket sales and overall revenues. By focusing on attracting event creators, the company strengthens its core ticketing business and broadens its appeal to a wider audience. EB focuses on attracting creators of large, popular events in major cities, driving consumer engagement. The platform hosted more than 1.4 million events, with more than 333,000 creators, including 82,000 new ones in the third quarter of 2024. Eventbrite has introduced the latest features, including timed entry, which is designed to give creators greater control over managing attendee flow, and 24/7 phone support for premium creators, along with overall customer support improvements, to enhance the platform's functionality and user experience. In September 2024, Eventbrite introduced a free-tier product to attract small creators by removing entry barriers to entry. This move aligns with the company\u2019s goal to foster growth by catering to creators of all sizes. Notably, more than 10,000 creators now use Eventbrite Ads monthly, using advanced tools to promote events and attract a larger consumer base. Large Consumer Base Aids EB\u2019s Performance Consumers are important for Eventbrite\u2019s growth and play a vital role in the marketplace. In the third quarter of 2024, EB reached 92 million active users, with 26 million of them making purchases. Eventbrite's efforts to re-engage former customers proved successful, with more than 750,000 paid tickets sold since September. The company expects this momentum to continue as it strengthens sales strategies, products and support to drive growth. The company is set to launch a redesigned mobile app early next year, which is currently in beta testing. The mobile app drives the highest consumer engagement and purchase frequency, with logged-in users benefiting from better personalization and localization while buying twice as often as on the website. Story Continues EB Struggles With Operational Efficiency The decline in paid creators suggests difficulties in retaining or attracting new ones. This struggle could impact the platform's ability to drive consistent growth and engagement. The introduction of a free tier has helped attract users, but converting them into paying customers remains a long-term challenge. Sustaining long-term consumer engagement, particularly among younger demographics, remains a challenge despite partnerships like TikTok. EB\u2019s Sales & Earnings Estimates Show Mixed Trend The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2025 revenues is pegged at $77.19 million, indicating a 10.5% year-over-year decline.

The consensus mark for 2025 is pegged at a loss of 1 cent per share, unchanged over the past 30 days, marking a sharp year-over-year rise of 93.75%.

Mashaid Ahmed Fri, Dec 27, 2024, 1:06 PM 6 Minuten Lesezeit In diesem Artikel: EB -1.58% ^RUT -1.28% ^GSPC -0.76% We recently published a list of 12 Best Technology Penny Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to look at where Eventbrite, Inc. (NYSE: EB ) stands against other best technology penny stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The Russell 2000, a benchmark index for small-cap stocks, has historically lagged behind the large-cap S&P 500. Over the past decade, the S&P 500 has delivered returns of 200.8%, nearly double the 103.2% return of the Russell 2000. Even in 2024, the S&P 500 outpaced small caps, returning 27.1% compared to the Russell 2000\u2019s 16.1%. However, a shift may already be underway. Since the U.S. presidential election on November 5, the Russell 2000 has nearly matched the S&P 500\u2019s returns, signaling a possible resurgence in small-cap performance. Analysts at CFRA forecast that the S&P SmallCap 600 Index will generate EPS growth of 20.9% in 2025 and 18.6% in 2026, a sharp contrast to the negative 8% EPS growth seen in 2024. The economic and political landscape also seems to favor small caps. Historically, small-cap stocks have performed best when the economy emerges from a slowdown, credit spreads tighten, and investor risk appetite improves. Donald Trump\u2019s return to the presidency has further buoyed optimism. Trump\u2019s policies emphasize domestic economic growth, which directly benefits small-cap companies, as nearly 80% of Russell 2000 revenue comes from domestic operations. Additionally, the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Small Business Optimism Index recently jumped above its 50-year average for the first time in three years following Trump\u2019s election victory. This surge in optimism indicates renewed confidence among small business owners, a critical driver for small-cap growth. Expert Explains Why Small and Mid-Cap Stocks Are Undervalued Gems In an interview with CNBC on November 4, Charlotte Daughtrey, Equity Investment Specialist at Federated Hermes, discussed the current investment landscape, particularly focusing on the small and mid-cap market. She highlighted that these segments are currently trading at or below their long-term averages, offering a 25% discount compared to large caps. Typically, small and mid-cap stocks should command a 10% premium due to their higher growth potential, but the ongoing risk environment, exacerbated by the pandemic and the prolonged period of higher interest rates, has led to their devaluation and for active investors this presents a significant opportunity. Daughtrey noted that the small and mid-cap space is particularly attractive due to its potential for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity. She explained that well-performing, niche-focused companies in this segment are often attractive targets for larger corporations seeking to acquire growth rather than investing heavily in research and development. This dynamic is particularly evident in the U.S., known for its innovative companies, and is a key reason why Federated Hermes is overweight in information technology. This sector not only offers growth but also benefits from the AI tailwind without being as crowded as some larger-cap technology stocks. Weiterlesen Daughtrey emphasized that small and mid-cap stocks are likely to perform well compared to large-cap companies if there is a strong economy in the United States because small and mid-cap companies are more domestically focused, with 70-80% of their revenues generated domestically compared to 50-50 for large caps. The current economic and political landscape presents a compelling case for investing in small and mid-cap technology stocks.

Inc.'s (NYSE:EB) Shift From Loss To Profit editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Tue, Dec 17, 2024, 2:27 PM 3 min read In This Article: EB -1.58% Eventbrite, Inc. ( NYSE:EB ) is possibly approaching a major achievement in its business, so we would like to shine some light on the company. Eventbrite, Inc. operates a two-sided marketplace that provides self-service ticketing and marketing tools for event creators in the United States and internationally. With the latest financial year loss of US$26m and a trailing-twelve-month loss of US$8.1m, the US$344m market-cap company alleviated its loss by moving closer towards its target of breakeven. As path to profitability is the topic on Eventbrite's investors mind, we've decided to gauge market sentiment. In this article, we will touch on the expectations for the company's growth and when analysts expect it to become profitable. Check out our latest analysis for Eventbrite According to the 6 industry analysts covering Eventbrite, the consensus is that breakeven is near. They anticipate the company to incur a final loss in 2024, before generating positive profits of US$5.0m in 2025. Therefore, the company is expected to breakeven just over a year from now. What rate will the company have to grow year-on-year in order to breakeven on this date? Using a line of best fit, we calculated an average annual growth rate of 68%, which is rather optimistic! If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, the company may become profitable much later than analysts predict. NYSE:EB Earnings Per Share Growth December 17th 2024 Underlying developments driving Eventbrite's growth isn\u2019t the focus of this broad overview, though, take into account that typically a high growth rate is not out of the ordinary, particularly when a company is in a period of investment. Before we wrap up, there\u2019s one issue worth mentioning. Eventbrite currently has a debt-to-equity ratio of 134%. Typically, debt shouldn\u2019t exceed 40% of your equity, and the company has considerably exceeded this. A higher level of debt requires more stringent capital management which increases the risk around investing in the loss-making company.

{"text": "EB Stock Jumps 17% in 3 Months: Is This the Right Time to Buy? Zacks Equity Research Mon, Dec 16, 2024, 8:56 PM 5 min read In This Article: EB -1.58% Eventbrite EB shares have appreciated 17.5% in the past three months, outperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s return of 11.5%. The rise in the share price is driven by the growing adoption of the company\u2019s events platform, leading to higher engagement from creators. Pricing changes and platform enhancements have significantly improved the user experience. However, a 5% year-over-year decline in net revenues to $77.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 was attributed primarily to softness in the paid ticket volume. The paid ticket volume dropped 14% to 19.7 million in the quarter. These figures highlight significant headwinds for Eventbrite, as reduced ticket sales directly impact revenue generation. These challenges have substantially contributed to Eventbrite's underperformance compared with the Zacks Internet - Services industry\u2019s growth of 18.4% over the same period. Eventbrite, Inc. Price and Consensus Eventbrite, Inc. Price and Consensus Eventbrite, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Eventbrite, Inc. Quote Creator Acquisition to Boost EB\u2019s Prospects Creator acquisition has been a key strategy for Eventbrite's growth, as the company aims to expand its core ticketing business. The focus is on attracting more event creators to the platform, which helps drive increased event listings and ticket sales, thus generating higher revenues. Eventbrite launched a free-tier product in September 2024, designed to make it easier for smaller creators to join the platform. This lowers the entry barrier for creators and helps Eventbrite attract users without significant initial costs. Strategic pricing changes and platform enhancements have accelerated creator acquisition since September 2024. More than 10,000 creators now use Eventbrite Ads monthly, with many adopting advanced marketing tools, fostering a loyal creator base and attracting more consumers to the platform. Eventbrite has built a strong acquisition history, expanding its platform through acquisitions in more than six countries, with a focus on the United States and Argentina. Among its key acquisitions are ToneDen, Picatic and Ticketea. The company is expanding its reach by partnering with TikTok to connect with younger audiences seeking unique experiences to share with friends. This partnership helps bring more consumers to the platform. In the third quarter, the number of people using Eventbrite to search for local events grew nearly 20% from last year. EB Stock to Ride on Consumer Focus Eventbrite is focusing on becoming a consumer-centric brand, targeting 21-35 year olds, known as social scouts, who actively look for and share unique local experiences. This group is more likely to discover events on Eventbrite and attend with friends, creating a strong network. EB's main focus is to grow its core ticketing business by attracting more creators and events. With more than 93 million average monthly active users and 19.7 million paid ticket volumes, Eventbrite is scaling its marketplace, targeting high event producer volumes. This expansion of the event catalog helps drive revenue growth and platform engagement. Eventbrite is seeing positive trends in key metrics, with improvements in creator acquisition, event volume and ticket transactions across free and paid events. Its returning creator base is trending to more consistent patterns, and combined with win-back efforts, the marketplace is expected to strengthen over time. Unicorn World is a family-friendly event featuring life-size animatronic unicorns and interactive experiences. The event benefits from Eventbrite's timed entry capabilities, which help manage large crowds by organizing attendees at different time slots throughout the day. Currently, Unicorn World hosts events in 3-4 cities per month and is expanding its tour dates to reach more communities. This growth highlights the significant opportunities in the experiential events market, as creators like Unicorn World use Eventbrite\u2019s platform to connect with new audiences. Story Continues EB\u2019s Estimate Revision Shows Downward Trend For the fourth quarter of 2024, Eventbrite expects net revenues between $74 million and $77 million. Revenues for 2024 are anticipated to be $322-$326 million. The consensus estimate for fourth-quarter 2024 revenues is pegged at $75.96 million, indicating a year-over-year decline of 13.45%. The consensus mark for the fourth-quarter 2024 bottom line is pegged at a loss of 5 cents per share, widened by a penny over the past seven days. The projection indicates a wider loss from the year-ago quarter's reported loss of a penny. For 2024, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $324.20 million, implying a decline of 0.59% from the previous year\u2019s actual. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is pegged at a loss of 12 cents per share, narrower than the loss of 21 cents mentioned 30 days ago. This figure also indicates an improvement from the year-ago quarter's reported loss of 26 cents.

Zacks Equity Research Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 5:40 PM 2 min read In This Article: EB -1.58% The proven Zacks Rank system focuses on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find winning stocks. Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks. Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large. In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's \"Value\" category. Stocks with \"A\" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment. One stock to keep an eye on is Eventbrite (EB) . EB is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. Another notable valuation metric for EB is its P/B ratio of 1.92. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 5.48. Over the past 12 months, EB's P/B has been as high as 4.90 and as low as 1.42, with a median of 2.77. Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. EB has a P/S ratio of 1.04. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.48. These are only a few of the key metrics included in Eventbrite's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, EB looks like an impressive value stock at the moment. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Eventbrite (EB) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices. A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years. The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Eventbrite is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price. Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock. Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Eventbrite imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher. Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>. Story Continues Earnings Estimate Revisions for Eventbrite This company is expected to earn -$0.20 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2024, which represents a year-over-year change of 23.1%. Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Eventbrite. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 17.8%. Bottom Line Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term. You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>> The upgrade of Eventbrite to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.

upgrades customer support as revenue dips CX Dive \u00b7 Michael Vi via Getty Images Bryan Wassel Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 10:00 AM 2 min read In This Article: EB -1.58% This story was originally published

Dive Brief: Eventbrite is upgrading customer support for event managers and its app for event-seeking consumers, executives said on a Q3 2024 earnings call last week. The event platform cut its customer service response times for event managers by 80% with improved technology and a second call center, CEO and Co-founder Julia Hartz said on the call. The company now offers 24/7 phone support for its \u201cpremium creators.\u201d A revamped version of the Eventbrite mobile app is currently in beta, with plans to launch early in 2025, according to Hartz. The updated app includes better personalization, discovery and engagement capabilities. Dive Insight: Eventbrite is focusing on improving experiences for businesses and consumers alike as it works to turn its sales slump around. Net revenue at the event platform was down 5% year over year to $77.8 million during the quarter, according to a Q3 2024 earnings report . However, elevated customer service and app improvements are expected to improve results, according to Hartz. The Eventbrite app was a bright spot for the company despite its revenue dip. The company saw 92.5 million monthly active users during the quarter, with the total number of users up nearly 20% year over year, Hartz said. The number of searches for local events was up 20% as well. \u201cWhy that matters is because that experience is only going to continue getting better as we roll out our reimagined consumer app \u2014 and that's driving pure discovery and demand to our creators' events,\u201d Hartz said during the call. Purchase frequency is twice as high on the app compared to the Eventbrite website, according to Hartz. The app also offers better opportunities to highlight local experiences and offer personalization to improve the customer experience. The beta app features aren\u2019t the only consumer-facing CX improvements. In October, Eventbrite introduced timed ticketing , which lets event managers offer tickets good for specific time slots. The feature is designed to make capacity management easier for organizers while reducing lines for attendees.

Story Continues Julia Hartz Thank you, Katie and welcome, everyone. In the third quarter, we delivered revenue of $77.8 million exceeding our outlook range. Importantly, our strategic actions are driving clear results. New creator acquisition is accelerating following our September pricing changes, our win back campaign is seeing early success and our enhanced product offerings are attracting both creators and consumers. We've strengthened our financial position while continuing to invest in growth. And the third quarter revenue upside is flowing into our updated full year outlook. I'd like to frame our progress through three key priorities. First, returning to growth in our core ticketing business is our top priority and this begins with attracting more creators and events to our marketplace. Following changes to our pricing model in September, we're observing early signs of stabilization. Our expanded free tier which allows creators to publish unlimited events without upfront fees has begun to show impact paid events return to year over year growth in the month of launch. We're seeing positive trends in key metrics, creator acquisition event, volume and ticket transactions are improving across both free and paid events. Our returning creator base is trending more consistently with historical patterns and we believe these improvements combined with our win back initiatives will strengthen our marketplace over time. Let me bring this to life with a concrete example of the type of creator we're focused on winning mega events. One of our largest partners in a exemplifies the creative entrepreneurship. We aim to support. They've pioneered an innovative concept called Silent Discos in incredible places, hosting events in unexpected venues like museums, caves, airfields and even cathedrals. What's particularly compelling about mega events is how they consistently tap into cultural trends and scale them effectively across multiple markets. Under the leadership of founder Nathan Reed, they've become an important partner by understanding what people want to do and making it happen on a massive scale. This type of strategic inventory not only drives significant ticket volume but also attracts new audiences to our platform, Strengthening our marketplace flywheel. The success of creators like mega events validates our strategy of investing in both innovative features and enhanced support capabilities to serve high value creators who can scale rapidly across markets. Building on this type of creator success, we're pursuing an active win back campaign with encouraging results with a steady cadence of targeted email marketing, paid advertising and in product messaging. We're communicating not only about the expanded free tier but also about compelling new features and our growing demand generation capabilities. Since early September former Eventbrite customers, we have won back, have sold more than three quarters of a million paid tickets on our platform and we see significant opportunity ahead. We plan to continue these campaigns into the fourth quarter as we strengthen our sales motion product capability and support offerings. Our sales team is driving marketplace growth through strategic inventory expansion with new leadership in place. We closed $4.5 million in new bookings this quarter with significant pipeline improvements across music, food and drink and comedy shows. We're particularly encouraged by our momentum and holiday and New Year's Eve events which are key drivers of consumer engagement, complementing our sales efforts. We're transforming our creator support model through technology improvements and adding a second support center. We've achieved an 80% reduction in response times and expanded to 24/7 phone support for premium creators. These enhancements combined with redesigned on boarding and expanded customer success coverage have yielded strong renewal rates among our larger creators. Our second key priority is enhancing the Eventbrite experience with product capabilities. Two weeks ago, we introduced timed entry which is designed to give creators greater control over managing the flow of attendees. Let me bring to life how this new functionality is already creating value for creators and driving marketplace growth. Unicorn world created by Patrick and Lauren Mines offers an immersive family friendly adventure complete with lifesize animatronic unicorns and interactive experiences. They're exactly the type of innovative creator who benefits from our new time entry capabilities as they manage large crowds across multiple time slots throughout their event days. Currently hosting events in 3 to 4 cities per month on Eventbrite, they're continually expanding their tour dates to bring their experience to more communities. The success of creators like unicorn world demonstrates the significant opportunity we see in the experiential events market since launching timed entry in beta. This August we've seen strong initial uptake among larger and more frequent creators, particularly in categories such as music, food, and drink and seasonal events. In total creators who have adopted timed entry have already generated nearly 400,000 tickets validating our strategy of expanding into new segments of the event market with sophisticated ticketing needs. This leads me to our third key priority, executing our vision to become the indispensable live experiences marketplace. These product innovations and early successes reflect our broader vision and are focused on the strategic pillars that will drive our transformation over the longer term. First, we're evolving into a consumer centered brand with a particular focus on social scouts. The 21- to 35-year-olds who actively seek out and share unique local experiences. This demographic is twice as likely to discover events through Eventbrite and significantly more likely to attend with friends, creating powerful network effects. Second, we're building a managed marketplace that matches supply and demand at the local level. This means not just connecting creators and consumers but also ensuring high quality inventory that resonates with our target audience. The success of mega events in unicorn world exemplifies the type of innovative scalable experiences. We aim to bring to more communities. Third, we're expanding our distribution and reach to meet consumers where they are. This is where our Tiktok partnership comes in. It's a prime example of how we're extending our platform to reach younger audiences, actively seeking unique experiences to share with friends. In the third quarter, the number of consumers coming to Eventbrite to search for local events grew by nearly 20% compared to last year. To further strengthen our consumer experience, we're excited about our plans to introduce a reimagined mobile app to the market. Currently in live beta testing, this new app will launch early next year and is designed to enhance personalization, discovery and consumer engagement. Notably, we see the greatest consumer engagement and purchase frequency within our mobile app where logged in usage is higher localization and personalization can be stronger and consumer purchase frequency is twice as great as on our web surfaces. These strategic pillars drive our marketplace flywheel by focusing on creators who host popular events in major cities. We're building a self-reinforcing cycle of growth. The results are clear, creators using our marketing tools show 27% higher revenue and stronger retention. More than 10,000 creators now use Eventbrite ads monthly, and 1/10 subscribe to enhanced marketing capabilities. As creators succeed, they become more loyal, attracting more consumers who in turn draw more high-quality creators to our platform as we execute our marketplace transformation. We're also announcing an important leadership update designed to support our next phase of growth. I'm excited to welcome Anand Gandhi as our new Chief Financial Officer, Anan will join us from via to where he helped transform financial performance while more than doubling revenue. Anon brings valuable perspectives from across the consumer entertainment landscape including Disney Fox Viacom and time, as well as experience scaling high growth platforms. As the CFO of skill share, Anand's appointment enables Lanny to focus on his role as Chief Operating Officer where he'll drive revenue generation and lead our sales and customer experience teams. Lanny has been a valued partner since joining a CFO in 2019. And this transition leverages his strength in driving operational excellence. We look forward to welcoming on, on, on November 19. Let me close with our clear path forward. Our strategic initiatives are delivering tangible results through accelerating event, creation and successful win back campaigns. We're well positioned to capture the opportunity ahead with enhanced platform capabilities, strong distribution partnerships and financial discipline. We remain confident in our ability to deliver increasing value for creators, consumers and shareholders. I would like to thank our bright wings for their hard work and dedication this year as we set the stage to deliver on our strategy and drive profitable long-term growth. And with that, I'll turn it over to Lanny to walk you through our third quarter results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, Lanny. Lanny Baker Thank you, Julia. We reported third quarter revenue of $77.8 million above our $74 million to $77 million outlook range but down 5% versus a year ago, due to ticket volume headwinds that we've called out previously. Ticketing revenue was 11% lower year to year, which was partially offset by a doubling in revenue from organizer fees and event rate, Ads on a combined basis. Non ticketing revenues represented 12% of revenue for the quarter. The pricing and packaging changes we introduced last year continued to impact ticketing growth in the third quarter. The total number of paid creators declined 12% from a year ago to 163,000 in the third quarter. However, as Julia described earlier, the free tier launched in September has begun to benefit creator acquisition and ticket volume comparisons in the quarter. Events per creator increased 3% year over year while tickets per event declined 5% As we issued $19.7 million paid tickets in the quarter down 14% year to year. The average ticket price increased by 3% year to year to $40.30. And our revenue take rate was 9.8% in the quarter, 60 basis points higher than a year ago. As a result, revenue per ticket was $3.97 in the third quarter compared to $3.57 a year ago. With the increase in take rate and revenue per ticket coming from the growth of eventbrite ads and organizer fees. Gross profit was $53.3 million in the third quarter, down 4% year over year for a gross margin of 68.5% compared to 68.3% a year ago. The modest increase in gross margin reflects higher marketplace revenues as well as our focus on cost containment within cost of revenue. Total operating expenses were $62.2 million in the third quarter compared to $67.2 million a year ago. Operating expenses included $5.4 million in reduction in force costs which were partially offset by $3.7 million in adjustments to our full year incentive compensation expense, product development expenses were $22.6 million in the third quarter compared to $23 million a year ago, down slightly as we reduced the team size. Sales marketing and support expenses were $23.7 million for the third quarter compared to $21.1 million a year ago. As lower marketing expenses were offset by an increase in chargebacks and fraud remediation expenses which totaled $6.8 million in the quarter compared to $1.4 million a year ago in the same period, general and administrative expenses were $15.9 million in the third quarter compared to $23.1 million in the third quarter of 2023 due to lower head count and related expenses associated with the cost savings that we announced in August. Net loss was $3.8 million for the third quarter of 2024. Compared with a net loss of $9.9 million in the same period in 2023, net loss in this quarter included $5.4 million in reduction in force costs as well as a $300,000 loss on debt extinguishment. Adjusted EBITDA as reported was $5.8 million in the third quarter. I should note that figure includes $5.4 million in severance and other costs associated with the reduction in force that we undertook during the quarter. Excluding those costs adjusted for the quarter would have been $10.8 million. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents were $531 million at the end of the third quarter, down from $576 million. At the end of the second quarter, Eventbrite's available liquidity as defined in our shareholder letter was $237 million at the end of the third quarter. Compared to $353 million at the end of the second quarter, reflecting the repurchase of $120 million in convertible notes. Long-term debt was reduced to $240 million from $359 million a quarter ago. In the first nine months of this year, cash flow from operations totaled $86 million after retiring $120 million of our 2025 convertible notes. Our focus now returns to our share repurchase program. We remain committed to buying back up to $50 million in stock this year, under our $100 million authorization. We've already completed $39 million in share of purchases year-to-date, reducing shares outstanding by approximately 7% since the start of the year. Turning to our outlook the company expects fourth quarter, 2024 revenue to be within a range of $74million to $77 million and full year 2024 revenue to be within a range of $322 million to $326 million. At the midpoint of our revenue outlook range, we expect full year adjusted EBITDA margin excluding the impact of severance costs and other non-routine items to be approximately 10% as we look to next year, it's a bit early to provide a specific financial outlook. However, there are a number of factors providing encouragement as we're planning for the year. By introducing our free tier, we've improved creator acquisition and event trends by delivering new features. We're expanding our market opportunity and serving new creators and consumers by engaging with creators and clearly communicating the value of our offerings through win back campaigns. We're bringing creators back to the platform by growing our strategic inventory through our sales channel. We're adding valuable inventory and driving the flywheel of our marketplace by strengthening our customer care and support. We are focused on customer satisfaction and retention and we're operating with discipline and generating solid cash flow which has enabled us to reduce leverage while also returning cash to shareholders. And with that, I'll turn the call over to our operator to take your questions. Question and Answer Session Operator Certainly, everyone at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session if you have any questions or comments, please press star one on your phone at this time. We do ask that while posing your question. Please pick up your handset. If you're listening on speaker phone to provide optimum sound quality. Once again, if you have any questions or comments, please press star one on your phone. Please hold while we poll for questions. Thank you. Your first question is coming from Cameron Manson Perone from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. Cameron Mansson Perone Thank you. First, I was wondering if you guys could provide some more color in terms of, you know, for the paid creators who left the platform during the kind of organizer fee transition, any color on where you think those paid creators went when they left the platform. And you know, you talked about some of the initiatives that have worked well to bring them back onto the platform. And any additional commentary just on what's proven most effective so far in winning them back and any new initiatives to accelerate that win back rate. Thanks. Julia Hartz Yeah, thanks, Cameron. You know, I think that the I want to be specific about what we're seeing. We, you know, rolled out this free tier on September 4 and we expected to see sort of waves of impact to the business. The first being our free creators who we think the pricing change was a bigger concern for those who are hosting free events. The second was new creator acquisition. And that being a potential barrier to the new creator, self-sign on funnel. And then the third being, returning paid creators, the customers that we acquire and retain and service through our sales channel, whether we are acquiring them net new through sales contracts or we're converting self-sign on customers to sales contracts are independent of the pricing changes. So, when we're thinking about winning back and where our self-sign on paid customers went, we're seeing that they went to a variety of different homegrown solutions or start up competitors. We're not seeing a ton of, of top of the market, major competitors that we track regularly. So we feel very confident that we can win back these creators and how we're doing that and we're doing it through a series of marketing channel activations. We're giving creators a chance to re connect with Eventbrite, incentivizing them to come back to the platform with the pricing change. But we're also using this interaction to update them on all the things that we have rolled out in the last year to make the platform stronger and to create a better marketplace for them. So, whether that's, you know, our social integration with TikTok ability to integrate their event link native to TikTok videos or it's the enhanced service and support that we have, we rolled out 24 7 phone support to premium customers, or it's the ability to use Eventbrite for timed entry events and it just much sleeker and more efficient end to end experience. These are the types of things that we're able to now use to incentivize customers to come back. And we feel very strongly about our current results. We saw, you know, three quarters of a million tickets come from customers that we've won back already in the platform since early September and we're just getting started. Cameron Mansson Perone That's really helpful. Thank you, Julia. Operator Thank you. Your next question is coming from Justin Patterson from Keyban capital Markets. Your line is live. Justin Patterson Thank you. This is Miles Jakubiak on for Justin. Maybe just another one on creators. Assuming most of the creators that you're seeing come back a little bit quicker on the free side. But how should we think about this impacting paid creative growth in the four Q? And then just as we see a full quarter of the reintroduction of the free tier in four Q. Anything we should keep in mind from a financial side for the quarter specifically on take rates, we expect that to kind of step down incrementally and, and rebase at, at a new level in four Q, any color on that would be helpful. Thanks. Julia Hartz Absolutely. So let me take your first question and I'll be clear about our path forward. And why we're confident in the growth trajectory around creators while we're not providing specific 2025 guidance today, I want to share the concrete evidence that we're seeing across our key growth drivers. So, the first is the marketplace transformation that we are in the midst of is really showing, showing early success. I talked about our expr our expanded free tier. And, and so I don't need to go back over that. But our you know, I didn't mention that our win back campaigns have brought over 13,000 creators back to the platform already. And this is again in over just about two months of work. Revenue per paid ticket is staying strong. It's just shy of $4. So, we're happy about that. We'll continue to focus on driving adoption of Eventbrite ads, which is a great way to lock in our customers and show them the benefit of the marketplace. Our sales team is just starting to be fully ramped, and I was happy with the, you know, over $4.5 million in new bookings this quarter. They're really focusing as the tip of the spear on that strategic inventory that is so important to driving consumer loyalty and repeat purchasing. I talked about the time to entry feature, but I also wanted to, to hit on the consumer reach. So that continues to expand. We saw 92.5 million monthly active users, a 20% increase in local event searches and mobile app users were up almost 20% year over year and why that matters is because that experience is only going to continue getting better as we roll out our reimagined consumer app. And that's driving pure discovery and demand to our creators' events. We're driving almost half of the tickets today. And we think as we continue to demonstrate strength here, creator adoption of not only our value-added services like Eventbrite ads where we see 10,000 users already, but also our enhanced marketing capabilities. And you know, our marketing tools will continue to grow our revenue and will continue to grow creator retention. So again, we think, you know that the near term has been noisy, we know that there are transition impacts to our metrics, but the underlying health of our marketplace is strong and improving. Lanny, do you want to take a second? Lanny Baker Sure, I can talk about the take rate questions you're looking into the fourth quarter. There are really three components of the take rate. Number one is the fees that we get on our ticketing business. And that is a function of the discounting that we may or may not do refund activity, etcetera. And I think what you'll see on the core ticketing take rate is stability there. On the second driver of our take rate is the growth of our Eventbrite advertising product and bet between where we are today. And a year ago, we had about seven or 8% of our gross ticket fees or sorry of our marketplace activity. Seven or 8% of GT was participating in ads a year ago today. It's 11% or 12% of the GTs participating in ads. And when we see customers turn on Eventbrite ads, we typically see a revenue lift on a per creator or per event basis in the neighborhood of 25% to 30%. So, continuing to drive additional penetration and uptake and success for creators with the Eventbrite ads product is a really important long-term driver of our take rate because it's a big step up in take rate on a per vendor per creator basis. And then finally, the organizer fees, which is, which would be the biggest difference between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. Organizer fees were, you know, as we said before, we expect them to be in the $1million to $2 million in the fourth quarter. And that'll be down from where they were in the third quarter and in the second quarter. So that will provide a little bit of an unwind on a, on a quarter-to-quarter basis on the take rate. But the other dynamics remain fully in place and and should continue to be very strong looking further into the future. We believe there is opportunity for premium services. Our pro plan subscriber base is, is holding up well. And, and that'll be an additional longer-term driver, but your question is specifically about the fourth quarter. So hopefully that's helpful. Thanks. Justin Patterson Yeah, that's helpful. Thank you both. Operator Thank you. Your next question is coming from Naved Khan from B Riley Securities. Your line is live. Naved Khan Hi, it's Ryan. I'm from Naved. Thanks for taking my question. So, I wanted to ask about Tiktok and last quarter, you had gave some guidance that there is $100 million daily impressions. I wanted to understand if that has changed at all. And then also if there was an event category that it was specifically benefiting, or you saw a difference in trends between. So, thanks. Julia Hartz Absolutely. So,Tiktok is one of several distribution partners that we work with to put the right event in front of the right person at the right time wherever they may be. And as we've seen more and more of our target consumer, which is really 21- to 35-year-olds, we call them social scouts. They are out searching for events around them and they're searching on social platforms. We felt it was the most natural partnership to allow our creators to take benefit of that market share of consumer eyeballs. And so, we, I we just we are integrated with TikTok to allow for creators to embed or actually allow for anyone to embed a native link to an event listing on video and on TikTok posts. And so, the daily impressions that we reported last quarter have remained relatively stable. We're continuing to work with TikTok on how the event listings and live experiences can be served up to the TikTok community and other places perhaps search and other organic ways that people are looking for things to do. And we're, we remain really confident, and you know, encouraged by what we're seeing. And we're also doing a fair amount of education for our creator community on how they can leverage TikTok both organically and through paid advertising to be able to reach a new audience and really, you know, gain traction for their events in terms of the categories that we see getting, you know, the the lion's share of attention on TikTok. It's really, I don't think it would be surprising to you to know that there are categories that we see really popular on Eventbrite for our core consumer. So, music being cheap among them, food and drink, events, community and culture, events. Those categories have seen relatively strong growth through this period and remain our most popular categories in the marketplace. Naved Khan That's helpful. Thank you. Operator Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.(Operator Instructions) View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard Recommended Stories", "symbol": "EB", "date": "2024-11-08T14:51:28+00:00",

Story Continues Q & A Highlights Q : Can you provide more color on where paid creators went after leaving the platform due to organizer fee transitions, and what initiatives have been effective in winning them back? A : Julia Hartz, CEO, explained that many creators moved to homegrown solutions or startup competitors rather than major competitors.

A : Julia Hartz noted that the marketplace transformation is showing early success, with over 13,000 creators returning.

Lanny Baker, CFO, added that while organizer fees will decrease, the core ticketing take rate should remain stable, and Eventbrite ads continue to drive revenue growth. Q : What is the status of the TikTok partnership, and are there specific event categories benefiting from it? A : Julia Hartz stated that daily impressions from TikTok have remained stable. The partnership allows creators to embed event links in TikTok posts, targeting the 21- to 35-year-old demographic. Popular categories benefiting include music, food and drink, and community events. Q : What are the key growth drivers for Eventbrite moving forward? A : Julia Hartz highlighted the marketplace transformation, expanded free tier, successful win-back campaigns, and strong consumer reach as key growth drivers. The focus is on driving adoption of Eventbrite ads and enhancing the consumer app to improve discovery and demand. Q : How is Eventbrite managing its financial outlook and cash flow? A : Lanny Baker mentioned that Eventbrite expects Q4 revenue between $74 million and $77 million, with a full-year adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 10%.
