[{"text": "Crane NXT, Co. (NYSE:CXT) Shares Could Be 29% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 5:40 PM 6 min read In This Article: CXT -1.44% Key Insights Crane NXT's estimated fair value is US$89.14 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Crane NXT is estimated to be 29% undervalued based on current share price of US$63.70 Our fair value estimate is 15% higher than Crane NXT's analyst price target of US$77.83 Does the January share price for Crane NXT, Co. ( NYSE:CXT ) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward. Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model . View our latest analysis for Crane NXT The Calculation We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$244.5m US$255.5m US$264.7m US$273.4m US$281.9m US$290.3m US$298.6m US$306.9m US$315.3m US$323.8m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x3 Analyst x2 Est @ 3.61% Est @ 3.31% Est @ 3.11% Est @ 2.96% Est @ 2.86% Est @ 2.79% Est @ 2.74% Est @ 2.70% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$227 US$221 US$212 US$204 US$195 US$187 US$179 US$170 US$163 US$155 (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.9b After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.6%. Story Continues Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$324m\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (7.6%\u2013 2.6%) = US$6.6b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = US$6.6b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.6%) 10 = US$3.2b The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$5.1b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$63.7, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 29% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. NYSE:CXT Discounted Cash Flow January 27th 2025 Important Assumptions Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Crane NXT as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.215. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for Crane NXT Strength Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows. Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows. Weakness Earnings declined over the past year. Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electronic market. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market. Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value. Threat Revenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year. Moving On: Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Wed, Dec 18, 2024, 9:09 PM 3 min read In This Article: CXT -1.44% Most readers would already be aware that Crane NXT's (NYSE:CXT) stock increased significantly by 5.7% over the past month. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Crane NXT's ROE. Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Crane NXT How To Calculate Return On Equity? The formula for return on equity is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Crane NXT is: 16% = US$176m \u00f7 US$1.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024). The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.16 in profit. What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth? We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes. A Side By Side comparison of Crane NXT's Earnings Growth And 16% ROE At first glance, Crane NXT seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 10%. This certainly adds some context to Crane NXT's decent 13% net income growth seen over the past five years. We then performed a comparison between Crane NXT's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 14% in the same 5-year period. NYSE:CXT Past Earnings Growth December 18th 2024 Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is CXT worth today? The intrinsic value infographic in our free research report helps visualize whether CXT is currently mispriced by the market. Story Continues Is Crane NXT Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits? In Crane NXT's case, its respectable earnings growth can probably be explained by its low three-year median payout ratio of 15% (or a retention ratio of 85%), which suggests that the company is investing most of its profits to grow its business. While Crane NXT has been growing its earnings, it only recently started to pay dividends which likely means that the company decided to impress new and existing shareholders with a dividend. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 15% of its profits over the next three years. However, Crane NXT's ROE is predicted to rise to 20% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio. Conclusion In total, we are pretty happy with Crane NXT's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.13 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.09 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2.65%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of engineered industrial products would post earnings of $1.06 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.06, delivering no surprise. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. Crane NXT , which belongs to the Zacks Technology Services industry, posted revenues of $403.5 million for the quarter ended September 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.33%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $352.9 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Crane NXT shares have lost about 5.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 21.2%. What's Next for Crane NXT? While Crane NXT has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Crane NXT: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.21 on $409.65 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.27 on $1.48 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year. Story Continues Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

CFOTO/CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images Netflix has grown into the world's largest streaming service with more than 280 million subscribers worldwide. It came out on top in 2024's streaming wars . Here's a look at Netflix's rise and what's next. 1997: Netflix is founded by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph. Reed Hastings attends the Netflix & Mediaset Partnership Announcement, Rome, 8th October 2019 Ernesto S. Ruscio/Getty Images/Netflix 1998: Netflix launches a DVD-by-mail rental service. That same year, Amazon founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos offers to buy the company. Charles Krupa/AP In his book \"That Will Never Work: The Birth of Netflix and the Amazing Life of an Idea,\" Randolph wrote that he and Hastings met with Bezos in 1998, who offered them \"probably something between $14 million and $16 million,\" Randolph wrote. But they turned down the offer. 1999: Netflix begins offering a subscription-based model, in which customers could choose movies to rent-by-mail for a monthly fee. Netflix DVDs return mailers are shown in a mail box in Encinitas, California Oct. 21, 2013.

Marc Randolph \"As you get older, if you're lucky, you realize two things: what you like, but also what you're good at,\" Randolph told Forbes in 2019 on why he left Netflix. \"The answer to both of them [for me] is early-stage companies. I like the chaos. I like the fact that you're working on hundreds of things at once.\" 2007: Netflix launches a video streaming service, free for its already-existing DVD-rental subscribers. Ore Huiying/Getty Images for Netflix Netflix ended 2006 with over 6 million subscribers for its DVD-rental service. But a New York Times story at the time highlighted how the company still faced doubts about its streaming plans, noting that it would cost Netflix $40 million to implement it. The company's stock dropped 6% with the announcement. But Hastings, who was CEO at the time, said that he had \"gotten used to\" reservations. 2012: Netflix debuts \"Lilyhammer,\" its first original series. The show was originally broadcast in Norway, but Netflix acquired the rights. It laid the foundation for Netflix's binge-release model and its surge in original programming, including expanding into international markets. \"Lilyhammer.\" Netflix \"This was the first time we streamed a show across multiple countries and languages \u2026 and it worked,\" Netflix's current co-CEO Ted Sarandos wrote in a blog post in February 2022. \"It worked because it was a deeply local story that we could share with the world,\" Sarandos added. 2013: Netflix ramps up its original programming with \"House of Cards\" and \"Orange Is the New Black,\" which gain critical acclaim and Emmys recognition.

Operating profit margin of 28.7% increased 180 basis points, compared with 26.9% last year, primarily reflecting favorable pricing, lower manufacturing costs, productivity gains, and cost saving actions, partially offset by unfavorable product mix. Adjusted operating profit margin was 31.1% compared with 29.4% in the prior year.

Operating profit margin was 16.4% compared with 25.0% last year, driven by the dilutive impact of the OpSec Security acquisition as well as changes in the Currency business, as favorable pricing, higher volumes and productivity gains were more than offset by higher manufacturing costs, and unfavorable mix. Adjusted operating profit margin was 21.9% compared with 27.6% in the prior year. Cash Flow and Other Financial Metrics For the third quarter of 2024, cash provided by operating activities was $66.7 million, compared with $102.8 million in the prior year. Adjusted free cash flow was $59.0 million, compared with $97.5 million in the prior year. The $38.5 million, or 39.5%, decrease in Adjusted free cash flow was primarily due to lower cash provided by operating activities driven by higher working capital requirements impacted by the timing of shipments. (Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures tables in this release for a detailed reconciliation of reported results to adjusted measures). The Company held cash and cash equivalents of $165.1 million as of September\u00a030, 2024, compared with $227.2 million as of December 31, 2023. Total debt was $793.2\u00a0million as of September\u00a030, 2024, compared with $644.9\u00a0million as of December 31, 2023. The Company repaid $65.0 million on its revolving credit facility during the third quarter of 2024, with an outstanding balance of $150.0 million as of September 30, 2024. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents and the increase in total debt reflect the financing associated with the May 3, 2024 OpSec Security acquisition.

Crane NXT reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). This press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted operating profit, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted EPS, free cash flow, and Adjusted free cash flow, that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are an addition, and not a substitute for or superior, to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income, net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. The Company's management believes that these non-GAAP measures of financial results (including on a forward-looking or projected basis) provide useful supplemental information to investors about Crane NXT. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP measures and their nearest GAAP equivalents. For example, other companies may calculate non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to calculate their financial performance, and therefore the Company's non-GAAP measures may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of certain forward-looking and projected non-GAAP measures, including Adjusted segment operating margin and Adjusted EPS, to the closest corresponding GAAP measure are not available without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from these non-GAAP measures, which could have a potentially significant impact on Crane NXT's future GAAP results. Crane NXT calculates Adjusted segment operating margin and Adjusted EPS as described below. \"Adjusted segment operating margin\" is calculated as Adjusted segment profit divided by sales. Adjusted segment profit is calculated as segment profit excluding acquired intangible asset amortization, restructuring charges, impact of acquisition related fair value step-up, and transaction related expenses. Impact of acquisition related fair value step-up includes acquisition related inventory step-up amortization and fixed asset step-up depreciation. Transaction related expenses include acquisition related expenses such as incremental professional fees associated with closing and integration of the acquisition, and expenses associated with the Separation. \"Adjusted EPS\" is calculated as Adjusted net income divided by diluted shares. Adjusted net income is calculated as net income excluding acquired intangible asset amortization, restructuring charges, impact of acquisition related fair value step-up, transaction related expenses, the tax effect of these adjustments and other discrete tax items. Impact of acquisition related fair value step-up includes acquisition related inventory step-up amortization and fixed asset step-up depreciation. Transaction related expenses include acquisition related expenses such as incremental professional fees associated with closing and integration of the acquisition, and expenses associated with the Separation. The Company's management believes that each of the following non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Company\u2019s financial conditions and operations: \"Adjusted operating profit\" and \"Adjusted operating margin\" add back to operating profit items which are outside of the Company's core performance, some of which may or may not be non-recurring, and which management believes may complicate the interpretation of the Company\u2019s underlying earnings and operational performance. These items include income and expense such as: acquired intangible asset amortization, restructuring charges, impact of acquisition related fair value step-up, and transaction related expenses. Impact of acquisition related fair value step-up includes acquisition related inventory step-up amortization and fixed asset step-up depreciation. Transaction related expenses include acquisition related expenses such as incremental professional fees associated with closing and integration of the acquisition, and expenses associated with the Separation. These items are not incurred in all periods, the size of these items is difficult to predict, and none of these items are indicative of the operations of the underlying businesses. Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures that exclude these items provide investors with an alternative metric that can assist in predicting future earnings and profitability that are complementary to GAAP metrics. \"Adjusted net income\" and \"Adjusted EPS\" exclude items which are outside of the Company's core performance, some of which may or may not be non-recurring, and which management believes may complicate the presentation of the Company\u2019s underlying earnings and operational performance. These measures include income and expense items that impacted operating profit such as: acquired intangible asset amortization, restructuring charges, impact of acquisition related fair value step-up, transaction related expenses, the tax effect of these adjustments and other discrete tax items. Impact of acquisition related fair value step-up includes acquisition related inventory step-up amortization and fixed asset step-up depreciation. Transaction related expenses include acquisition related expenses such as incremental professional fees associated with closing and integration of the acquisition, and expenses associated with the Separation. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures exclude income and expense items that impacted net income and earnings per diluted share such as related party interest with Crane Company incurred prior to the Separation. These items are not incurred in all periods, the size of these items is difficult to predict, and none of these items are indicative of the operations of the underlying businesses. Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures that exclude these items provide investors with an alternative metric that can assist in predicting future earnings and profitability that are complementary to GAAP metrics. \u201cFree cash flow,\u201d \u201cAdjusted free cash flow\u201d and \"Adjusted free cash flow conversion\u201d provide supplemental information to assist management and investors in analyzing the Company\u2019s ability to generate liquidity from its operating activities. The measure of free cash flow does not take into consideration certain other non-discretionary cash requirements such as, for example, mandatory principal payments on the Company\u2019s long-term debt. Free cash flow is calculated as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Adjusted free cash flow is calculated as free cash flow adjusted for certain cash items which management believes may complicate the interpretation of the Company\u2019s underlying free cash flow performance such as certain transaction related cash flow items. Adjusted free cash flow conversion is calculated as Adjusted free cash flow divided by Adjusted net income. These items are not incurred in all periods, the size of these items is difficult to predict, and none of these items are indicative of the operations of the underlying businesses. Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures that exclude these items provide investors with an alternative metric that can assist in predicting future cash flows that are complementary to GAAP metrics. \"Adjusted EBITDA\" and \"Adjusted EBITDA margin\" exclude net interest expense, tax expense and depreciation and amortization expense from net income, as well as Special items such as restructuring charges, impact of acquisition related fair value step-up, and transaction related expenses. Impact of acquisition related fair value step-up includes acquisition related inventory step-up amortization and fixed asset step-up depreciation. Transaction related expenses include acquisition related expenses such as incremental professional fees associated with closing and integration of the acquisition, and expenses associated with the Separation. Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures that exclude these items provide investors with an alternative metric that can assist in predicting future earnings and profitability that are complementary to GAAP metrics. \"Net leverage ratio\" refers to Net debt divided by trailing twelve months (TTM) Adjusted EBITDA. \"Net debt\" represents total debt (excluding deferred financing costs) less cash and cash equivalents. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our ability to satisfy our debt obligation with currently available funds. References to \"core,\" such as \"core sales,\" exclude currency effects and, where applicable, the first-year impacts of acquisitions and divestitures. Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures that exclude these items provide investors with an alternative metric that can assist in identifying underlying growth trends in our business and facilitate comparison of our sales performance, for example, with prior and future periods that are complementary to GAAP metrics.

Positive Points Crane NXT Co ( NYSE:CXT ) reported a 14% year-over-year increase in sales, reaching approximately $400 million, with core sales growth of 5% excluding the OpSec acquisition. The company announced two strategic acquisitions: De La Rue Authentication Solutions and TruTags Smart Packaging technology, which are expected to drive future growth and shareholder value. Crane NXT Co successfully integrated OpSec, achieving operational improvements in manufacturing and back-office processes. The company published its first ESG report, highlighting its commitment to philanthropy, sustainability, and good governance. Crane NXT Co repaid approximately $65 million of outstanding debt, ending the quarter with a net leverage of approximately 1.7 times, demonstrating strong financial management. Negative Points The gaming segment underperformed expectations, with order rates not accelerating as anticipated, impacting overall revenue growth. Adjusted segment operating margin was diluted by the OpSec acquisition and an unfavorable product mix, reflecting challenges in maintaining profitability. The company lowered its adjusted free cash flow conversion guidance to approximately 70% due to the timing of international currency shipments. Crane NXT Co expects a double-digit decline in US currency volume in 2025, driven by the Federal Reserve's anticipated orders, impacting future revenue. The company anticipates flat revenue growth for 2025, indicating potential challenges in achieving organic growth across its segments. Story Continues Q & A Highlights Q : Can you provide more detail on the outlook for CPI verticals in 2025, particularly regarding gaming? A : Aaron Saak, CEO, explained that while vending, financial services, and retail are performing as expected with mid-single-digit growth, gaming order rates were slower than anticipated due to OEM partners reducing inventory levels. The company expects CPI revenue to be flat year-over-year in Q4, with other markets growing at mid-single digits. Q : How should we think about the impact of US currency volume declines on the SAT business in 2025? A : Aaron Saak noted that while US currency volumes will decline due to Federal Reserve order rates, strong international currency growth and the integration of OpSec will help offset this. Overall, Crane NXT expects flat revenue in 2025, with productivity improvements and OpSec synergies maintaining segment margins. Q : Does the flat revenue guidance for 2025 include the De La Rue acquisition? A : Aaron Saak clarified that the flat revenue guidance does not include De La Rue, as they will not assume any contribution until the acquisition officially closes. Q : Can you elaborate on the potential impact of the $10 bill redesign on Crane NXT's business? A : Aaron Saak expressed confidence in Crane NXT's relationship with the US government and the inclusion of advanced security features in the new $10 bill. He explained that the cost difference between current and redesigned bills could be attributed to added security features, benefiting Crane NXT. Q : What is the strategy for growth in product authentication, and how do recent acquisitions fit into this? A : Aaron Saak highlighted the integration of OpSec and the planned acquisition of De La Rue as steps to build a strong authentication portfolio. The company is focusing on expanding wallet share with existing customers and exploring new markets like pharma and healthcare, aiming for high single-digit growth in the authentication segment.

success for CX leaders SAN FRANCISCO , Nov. 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Zendesk's 2025 Customer Experience (CX) Trends Report reveals a pivotal shift in customer expectations: today's consumers demand AI interactions that feel more human, personalized, and engaging than ever before. Drawing on insights from over 10,000 global consumers and business leaders, Zendesk's seventh annual report uncovers five critical trends that will shape the future of customer service, underscoring how human-centric AI is redefining customer loyalty and becoming a strategic edge for companies. Zendesk, Inc. (PRNewsfoto/Zendesk, Inc.) The report highlights a growing divide between companies that embrace AI, termed \"CX Trendsetters,\" and those lagging behind in traditional approaches. As consumer expectations continue to rise, businesses that integrate AI with a focus on empathy and personalization are gaining a strong advantage, building trust, and boosting customer retention. In fact, CX Trendsetters experience 33% higher customer acquisition rates, 22% higher customer retention rates, and 49% higher cross-sell revenue, proving a thoughtful approach to AI can be transformative\u2014not just for creating memorable and meaningful customer experiences but also to the bottom line. \"AI should be more than just another technology we use\u2014it's a way to bring companies and customers closer, and it's redefining the relationships we can build,\" said Zendesk CEO Tom Eggemeier . \"At Zendesk, we believe that AI should be in service to humans and help companies understand and better connect to their customers as individuals. When brands focus on creating genuine, human-centered AI interactions, they don't just make things run more smoothly\u2014they create trust, loyalty, and a lasting connection. This report shows that putting customers at the heart of AI is more than a smart strategy; it's becoming the new standard for building loyalty in a rapidly changing world.\" Five Key Trends from Zendesk's 2025 CX Trends Report 1. Autonomous Service Accelerates with AI Copilots Companies are embracing AI copilots\u2014AI tools that support agents by managing routine tasks and enhancing efficiency\u2014as they move toward autonomous service models. Seventy-three percent of agents believe that having an AI copilot would help them do their job better, freeing them up to focus on more complex issues, enabling a smooth and scalable experience. While 90% of CX Trendsetters report positive returns on AI tools for agents, as copilots improve both the customer journey and operational agility, the use of shadow AI\u2013external tools unapproved for agent use\u2013has jumped up to 250% year-on-year in some industries. This is putting customer privacy, security and service quality at risk. Story Continues As CX leaders move towards a model of autonomous CX, with 75% of CX leaders expecting 80% of customer interactions to be resolved without human intervention in the next few years, they are entrusted with the responsibility to ensure their customers' data is kept safe and secure by providing AI solutions that prioritize reliability and security. 2. Consumer Confidence Rises with Human-Like AI Agents In 2025, consumers are looking for AI that goes beyond efficiency and feels genuinely human. With 64% of consumers saying they are more likely to trust AI agents that embody traits like friendliness and empathy, companies are prioritizing AI that's engaging, relatable and authentic. This focus on human-like AI is yielding strong results. CX leaders who invest in this approach report a significant boost in customer satisfaction and loyalty. By infusing AI with personality and warmth, companies are better positioned to meet rising expectations, differentiate themselves from competitors, and build lasting relationships with customers. Shabib Sheikh , Vice President of Customer Support and Success, Vagaro, says \"AI is an integral part of who we are and it's allowing us to do more with less. By leveraging Zendesk's AI, we've resolved 44% of incoming requests, reduced resolution time by 87%, and most importantly increased CSAT to 92%\u2014setting a new standard for the beauty and wellness industry.\" 3. Personal AI Assistants Shape the Future of Customer Interactions Personal AI assistants, like Siri and Alexa, are becoming integral to daily life, leading consumers to expect assistant-driven experiences in customer service, too. Sixty-seven percent of consumers are ready to delegate tasks like tracking orders and receiving personalized recommendations to AI, indicating an opportunity for companies to embrace assistant-first experiences. This shift marks the beginning of a more convenient, AI-led interaction model that frees consumers to focus on what matters most to them. CX leaders preparing for an assistant-first world are already ahead, designing seamless interactions where AI handles routine requests, allowing human agents to focus on high-impact areas. With consumers increasingly expecting instant service through AI assistants, companies that prioritize these tools will deliver the frictionless, responsive experience that today's customers demand. 4. Voice AI Gains Ground as the Preferred Channel for Complex Issues As Voice AI technology advances, customers are finding it easier to articulate their needs through voice, particularly for complex issues. Half of consumers have already engaged with Voice AI and want to adopt these technologies for their ability to have natural and conversational interactions. By helping companies better connect with consumers across multiple platforms, including phone, messaging, and in-app, Voice AI offers consumers the sense of being \"heard\" and understood. This capability is especially valuable in handling nuanced inquiries, as Voice AI provides a more seamless experience that resonates with users seeking efficient yet personal support. In fact, 90% of Trendsetters recognize it as the next evolution in customer communication. 5. Personalization Redefines Customer Loyalty Personalized service is now a defining feature of customer loyalty, with 61% of consumers expecting AI-driven interactions to feel tailored to them. As their expectations for great service rises, consumers have increasingly low tolerance for bad experiences, with 63% willing to switch to a competitor due to just one bad experience - a trend that's grown by 9% year-on-year. As CX leaders double down on personalization to enhance customer relationships, loyalty is becoming the ultimate power metric in today's competitive landscape. Through personalized recommendations and tailored responses, AI enables companies to create unique, meaningful experiences that meet and exceed customer expectations for relevance and value. Fifty-six percent of companies seen as Trendsetters are prioritizing using AI to personalize the customer experience. As they embrace AI, they are realizing tremendous value and are 128% more likely to report high ROI from AI, solidifying their position as leaders in the AI-powered CX era. The Path Forward for CX Leaders Zendesk's 2025 CX Trends Report offers a roadmap for businesses looking to thrive in an AI-driven world. Companies aiming to lead must integrate AI with a human-centric approach, focusing on empathy, personalization, and transparency to meet customer demands.
