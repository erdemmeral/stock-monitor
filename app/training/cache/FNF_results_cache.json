[{"text": "Should Value Investors Buy Fidelity National Financial (FNF) Stock? Zacks Equity Research Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 5:40 PM 2 min read In This Article: FNF -0.91% While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks, we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies. With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies. Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks. On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the \"Value\" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and \"A\" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today. Fidelity National Financial (FNF) is a stock many investors are watching right now. FNF is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 9.37. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 27.98. Over the past year, FNF's Forward P/E has been as high as 12.26 and as low as 8.64, with a median of 10.31. Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales.

CHICAGO , Jan. 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Investment Property Exchange Services, Inc. ( IPX1031 ), the national leader in 1031 Qualified Intermediary services, has released its annual 1031 trends, outlining the key developments expected in the commercial real estate (CRE) market and the 1031 Exchange landscape for 2025. As economic conditions and market dynamics evolve, staying informed on these trends is crucial for investors and property owners. \"Utilizing 1031 Exchanges fosters economic growth by enabling capital reinvestment and job creation,\" IPX1031 President John Wunderlich stated. \"We strive to provide investors with the essential knowledge and tools to navigate the complexities of the market and maximize 1031 investment potential.\" Given the anticipated growth in the CRE market, 1031 transactions will stay active as informed investors and commercial property owners employ strategic 1031 tax deferral tools. Anticipated 1031 Exchange Trends for 2025: Reverse and Improvement (Build-to-Suit) Exchanges: Increased popularity due to higher interest rates and limited quality inventory. Maturing Loans and Refinancing: Significant transactional activity driven by maturing loans and the need for better ROI and loan terms through 1031 Exchanges. Seller Financing : Traditional financing challenges will lead to more seller-financed transactions. Shifts in Asset Classes: Multifamily, industrial, and retail properties are expected to see robust activity. Passive Investments: A shift towards exchanging management-intensive properties for passive investment types like NNN (Triple Net Lease) and fractional ownership properties such as DSTs (Delaware Statutory Trusts). Geographical Shifts: Owners will continue shifting investment property purchases to more landlord regulatory friendly areas. ADU/Mixed-Use Growth: Thriving 1031 opportunities for properties with accessory dwelling units (ADUs) and mixed-use properties.

Jan 15, 2025, 10:11 PM 8 min read Those expecting to see products made from meat grown in a lab from animal cells on supermarket shelves by now will be sadly disappointed. There has been tremendous interest in this area of innovation over the last few years, not least for its touted long-term potential to aid world food security. The companies behind the development of cultivated meat have attracted significant backing from investors. As you will see below, so far, there has been approval granted for these products in a small number of markets, even if others \u2013 Italy and Austria, for example \u2013 have ruled against it. Most jurisdictions \u2013 including the EU \u2013 have yet to make a ruling. As of yet, consumer-facing products have only appeared in very few high-end stores or restaurants. There are still large hurdles to overcome, none higher than the cost of producing such animal protein. Eat Just/Good Meat founder Josh Tetrick, for example, has told Just Food in an interview that scaling-up was a \u201cmassive challenge\u201d . But slow progress is not the same as stopping entirely and there are plenty of entrepreneurs involved in this nascent industry who are determined to see it succeed. The list of countries below will increase when that success starts to become evident. The first three Singapore In December 2020, Singapore, keen to be seen as a leader in the food technology area, became the first territory to give regulatory approval to cell-based meat. The south-east Asian city-state\u2019s regulator, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA), gave the nod to cultivated meat products made by US firm Eat Just . Eat Just\u2019s \u201cchicken bites\u201d were approved for sale there, initially in a local restaurant. At the time, Eat Just\u2019s Tetrick said on Twitter he was \u201cproud to share that Eat Just is the first company in history to receive approval to sell cultured meat (safe meat from animal cells instead of slaughtered animals)\u201d. However, in March 2024, Eat Just set out the reasons for a pause in its production of cultivated meat in Singapore. The company\u2019s cell-based meat arm, Good Meat, halted the sale of cultured-chicken to Hubers Bistro diners in the country. Eat Just said it was preparing for \u201ca new phase of selling to consumers\u201d. Two months later, Eat Just revealed it had secured its first retail listings for its cell-based meat. Its cell-cultivated chicken was to be sold under the Good Meat 3 brand at Huber\u2019s Butchery in Singapore. The product comprises 3% cultivated chicken, with the rest made of plant-based ingredients. Other cultivated meat company approvals in Singapore are understood to be in the pipeline, including that of Netherlands-based Mosa Meat . Story Continues In July 2024, locally-based Umami Bioworks , which had recently inked a deal with US firm Friends & Family Pet Food Co. (FnF) to create lab-grown fish treats for cats, was said to be \u201cactively in discussions\u201d with its local regulator ahead of a planned launch in 2025. The US Approval in the US is slightly more complicated in that cell-based meat has been given approval at the national level but has been banned by certain states. In June 2023, the US cleared cultivated-chicken from locally-based Upside Foods and Good Meat for sale . The approval followed a four-year joint regulatory process by the US Department of Agriculture and the country's Food and Drug Administration. Cell-based chicken products from both companies were subject to a \u201chistoric two-agency regulatory process\u201d with Good Meat\u2019s parent Eat Just describing the ruling as a \u201cwatershed moment for the burgeoning cultivated meat, poultry and seafood sector, and for the global food industry\u201d. At the time, Good Meat said it had already begun commercial production and signed a deal to supply its first restaurant through the Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s Group in Washington DC. However, there has been some pushback from individual states. In May 2024, Florida governor Ron DeSantis signed legislation which banned the sale of lab-grown meat in the southern state. He said the state was \u201cfighting back against the global elite\u2019s plan to force the world to eat meat grown in a petri dish or bugs to achieve their authoritarian goals\u201d. The ban, aped by the governor of Nebraska later in the year, is facing a legal challenge. Upside Foods\u2019 cell-based meat. Credit: @upsidefoods / Facebook Israel Israel-based Aleph Farms , which had previously submitted applications to sell its Aleph Cuts product in Switzerland and the UK, received regulatory approval for producing and selling cultivated-beef in its home market in January 2024. The company said it received a \u201cno questions\u201d letter for its cultivated-beef product, Petit Steak, from Israel\u2019s Ministry of Health \u201cfollowing a rigorous review process\u201d. Getting the green light allowed Aleph Farms to be the first producer and marketer of cultivated-meat in Israel and the Middle East. Like Singapore, Israel\u2019s government is keen to support local food technology businesses. The country has scores of researchers across 11 academic institutions and two dedicated food-tech research centres to help keep it at the forefront of developments. The next four? The UK In July 2024, UK cell-based protein business Meatly received regulatory clearance to sell cultivated-meat for use in its home market, but only in in pet food. London-based Meatly described the news as \u201ca huge leap forward for the cultivated-meat industry\u201d after passing the UK\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) \u201crigorous inspection process\u201d. Meatly\u2019s production facility was approved by the UK\u2019s Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs and APHA to produce and handle its cultivated chicken. The company, which was established in 2022, said it has proactively prepared a safety dossier and conducted testing to demonstrate that its cultivated chicken is safe and healthy for pets. The green light has not yet been given for cell-based food aimed at UK consumers of the human variety. In August 2023, Aleph Farms revealed it had requested UK approval for cell-based meat Aleph Farms estimated the UK\u2019s Food Standards Agency (FSA) would take up to two years to consider the application. The FSA confirmed it had received Aleph Farms\u2019 submission. The agency said it could not comment further until the application was entered onto a publicly available \u201cregister of regulated product applications\u201d. The Netherlands In July 2023, The Netherlands became the first EU member to allow taste testing of cultivated-meat products in a move seen as a prelude to market approval. The Dutch government has partnered with the cultivated meat industry \u2013 specifically local companies Meatable and Mosa Meat \u2013 to develop a code of practice for the facilitation of taste tests for cell-cultured meat and seafood products. Like Israel and Singapore, The Netherlands is keen to become a global hub for food-tech, including cultivated-meat production. In January, the country announced the launch of two government-backed cellular agriculture scale-up facilities \u201coffering companies the resources needed to move beyond research and into scalable production.\u201d The projects are part of the Cellular Agriculture initiative, backed by the National Growth Fund. The Cultivate at Scale (CaS) facility in Maastricht is dedicated to cell culture bio-processing. The facility is open-access, allowing companies to use it for for research, development and pilot-scale production. Mosa Meat's cultivated beef patty. Credit: Mosa Meat. Switzerland In July 2023, Israel\u2019s Aleph Farms applied for regulatory approval for its lab-made steak to the Swiss Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO) in collaboration with Switzerland\u2019s largest supermarket chain Migros , which first invested in the company in 2019. The Israeli company is keen to target fine dining foodservice outlets in the country. As yet, no approval has been forthcoming. But, despite the delay, there is a feeling that Switzerland could become a serious player in the cultivated-meat area, partly because of the effort being made by major food companies there. December 2024 saw the launch of the Cultured Hub facility in Kempthal. A joint venture between three Swiss industry heavyweights \u2013 retailer Migros, ingredients supplier Givaudan and processing business B\u00fchler Group as first announced in 2021 \u2013 uses their experience to accelerate the production of lab-grown animal protein. The facility, dubbed The Cultured Hub, features advanced labs and fermentation capabilities to help start-ups scale from lab to pilot operations. Yannick G\u00e4chter, CEO of The Cultured Hub, said: \u201cThe launch of The Cultured Hub is a pivotal moment in the global push for sustainable food production. The opening of this facility is not just an achievement for our team, but a landmark moment for the industry.\u201d Spain Spain, too, has yet to approve cell-based meat but as long ago as January 2021 it showed its interest in the potential of this nascent technology. It was announced then that local start-up BioTech Foods would be leading a government-backed project that would see ten research institutions and seven organisations come together to make meat directly from animal cells. Called the Culturedmeat project, BDI Biotech, Neoalgae, Argal, the Autonomous University of Madrid, Oviedo University, Barcelona Science Park, University of Seville and University of Granada were among the consortium partners announced. \"Protein pioneers: The countries that have approved cultivated meat\" was originally created and published by Just Food , a GlobalData owned brand.

in Your Portfolio Zacks Equity Research Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 8:49 PM 3 min read In This Article: RNR -0.15% RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. RNR is currently aided by improved premiums and investment income, sturdy segmental performances, buyouts, and a solid financial position. The rise in returns from the fixed maturity portfolio and improving underwriting results add further momentum. In the past six months, RNR has delivered 11% growth, outperforming the industry\u2019s 2.1% growth. The company\u2019s price performance also outperformed its peers, such as First American Financial Corporation FAF and Fidelity National Financial, Inc. FNF, which gained 1.6% and 2.5%, respectively. The company also outperformed the S&P 500\u2019s 3.9% rise. RNR's 6-Month Price Performance Comparison Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Now, let\u2019s take a look at the stock\u2019s growth drivers. RNR\u2019s Growth Drivers RenaissanceRe is actively pursuing growth through strategic acquisitions and business expansion. The recent acquisition of Validus Re and related businesses from AIG has significantly strengthened its global property and casualty reinsurance operations and enhanced profitability. The company also optimizes its portfolio by divesting non-core assets. RNR\u2019s strong cash position supports its growth initiatives and shareholder returns. Over the past 12 months, it generated $3.9 billion in net operating cash flow and repurchased $106.8 million in shares in the third quarter. Increasing premiums from its Property and Casualty & Specialty segments are expected to drive performance further. Strong underwriting results contribute to profit growth, which is evident in recent upward estimate revisions. Moreover, RNR is currently trading at a discount compared to the industry average. The stock is currently trading at 1.24X, trailing 12-month tangible book value, which compares to 1.48X for the industry, indicating undervaluation. The company has a Value Score of B. Estimate Revisions for RNR Stock Reflecting the positive sentiment around RenaissanceRe, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has seen upward revisions. The consensus estimate for 2024 adjusted earnings for RNR is currently pegged at $42.29 per share, which indicates 12.7% year-over-year growth. The company beat earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 28%. The consensus estimate for 2024 revenues suggests 35.5% year-over-year growth. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Key Concerns for RNR There are a few factors that investors should keep an eye on. RenaissanceRe faces escalating expenses due to higher net claims and claim expenses, acquisition costs, and operational expenses. We expect these to escalate by more than 44% on a year-over-year basis in 2024. The rising expenses pose a risk to the company\u2019s profit margins. Story Continues The company\u2019s long-term debt to capital of 43.9% is significantly higher than the industry average. Its debt load increased from $1.2 billion at the end of 2022 to $1.9 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024. This elevated debt level has led to a sharp rise in interest expenses, which grew 41.1% year over year in the first nine months of 2024. Conclusion RenaissanceRe exhibits significant growth potential, driven by strategic acquisitions such as Validus Re, increasing premiums, and solid underwriting performance. Upward revisions in estimates reflect its resilience, further supported by strong cash flow and shareholder-friendly initiatives like share repurchases. However, rising expenses, elevated debt levels, and increasing interest costs present challenges to profitability. Current shareholders may find it prudent to hold their positions, while prospective investors might consider waiting for a more favorable entry point to capitalize on its long-term potential.

Zacks Equity Research Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 2:20 PM 3 min read Launched on 09/09/2010, the Vanguard S&P Mid-Cap 400 Value ETF (IVOV) is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to provide a broad exposure to the Mid Cap Value segment of the US equity market. The fund is sponsored by Vanguard. It has amassed assets over $904.53 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Value segment of the US equity market. Why Mid Cap Value Mid cap companies have market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion. They usually have higher growth prospects than large cap companies and are less volatile than small cap companies. Thus they have a nice balance of growth potential and stability. Carrying lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, value stocks also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. When you look at long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets. But in strong bull markets, growth stocks are more likely to be winners. Costs Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts if all other fundamentals are the same. Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.15%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space. It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.76%. Sector Exposure and Top Holdings ETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis. This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 25.30% of the portfolio. Industrials and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three. Looking at individual holdings, Illumina Inc (ILMN) accounts for about 1.47% of total assets, followed by Expand Energy Corp (EXE) and Fidelity National Financial Inc (FNF). The top 10 holdings account for about 7.97% of total assets under management. Performance and Risk IVOV seeks to match the performance of the S&P MidCap 400 Value Index before fees and expenses. The S&P MidCap 400 Value Index measures the performance of value stocks of medium-size U.S. companies. The ETF has lost about -1.03% so far this year and was up about 12.35% in the last one year (as of 01/13/2025). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $83.49 and $104.98. The ETF has a beta of 1.17 and standard deviation of 19.60% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 296 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk. Story Continues Alternatives Vanguard S&P Mid-Cap 400 Value ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, IVOV is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Mid Cap Value area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space. The iShares Russell Mid-Cap Value ETF (IWS) and the Vanguard Mid-Cap Value ETF (VOE) track a similar index. While iShares Russell Mid-Cap Value ETF has $13.45 billion in assets, Vanguard Mid-Cap Value ETF has $17.11 billion. IWS has an expense ratio of 0.23% and VOE charges 0.07%. Bottom-Line Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.

Financial, Inc. (NYSE:FNF) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 81% of the company editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sun, Jan 5, 2025, 3:43 PM 4 min read In This Article: FNF -0.91% Key Insights Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Fidelity National Financial's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions The top 11 shareholders own 51% of the company Insiders have been selling lately To get a sense of who is truly in control of Fidelity National Financial, Inc. ( NYSE:FNF ), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 81% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Fidelity National Financial. View our latest analysis for Fidelity National Financial NYSE:FNF Ownership Breakdown January 5th 2025 What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Fidelity National Financial? Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. Fidelity National Financial already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Fidelity National Financial's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. NYSE:FNF Earnings and Revenue Growth January 5th 2025 Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Fidelity National Financial. Our data shows that BlackRock, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 15% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 9.8% and 5.9%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.

Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company.

Does It Mean for the Stock? Zacks Equity Research Wed, Dec 11, 2024, 8:00 PM 3 min read In This Article: FNF -0.91% FNF Group (FNF) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices. The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system. The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for FNF Group basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price. Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock. Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for FNF Group imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher. Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>. Story Continues Earnings Estimate Revisions for FNF Group This provider of title insurance and mortgage services is expected to earn $4.57 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2024, which represents a year-over-year change of 28.7%. Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for FNF Group. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1%. Bottom Line Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term. You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>> The upgrade of FNF Group to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.

Zacks Equity Research Fri, Jan 3, 2025, 5:40 PM 2 min read In This Article: FNF -0.91% Here at Zacks, we focus on our proven ranking system, which places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, to find winning stocks. But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers. Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels. In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's \"Value\" category. Stocks with \"A\" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment. One company value investors might notice is Fidelity National Financial (FNF) . FNF is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 12.26, while its industry has an average P/E of 27.55. Over the past 52 weeks, FNF's Forward P/E has been as high as 13.53 and as low as 8.87, with a median of 10.32. Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. FNF has a P/S ratio of 1.14. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.2.

Q3 Earnings Lag Estimates Zacks Equity Research Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 2:25 AM 3 min read In This Article: FNF -0.91% FNF Group (FNF) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.30 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.41 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.23 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -7.80%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this provider of title insurance and mortgage services would post earnings of $1.27 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.24, delivering a surprise of -2.36%. Over the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates. FNF Group , which belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry, posted revenues of $3.6 billion for the quarter ended September 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.82%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.78 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. FNF Group shares have added about 16.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 21.2%. What's Next for FNF Group? While FNF Group has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for FNF Group: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

December meeting, marking a third consecutive cut. This follows a 25 bp cut in November and a 50 bp cut in September. The September cut was the first in over four years, signaling a shift in the Fed\u2019s priorities in policy-making. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned at the conclusion of the December Fed meet that the central bank is currently projecting no more than two instances of rate reductions in 2025. This is a departure from the Fed\u2019s September outlook, which had promised at least four cuts in the new year. This indicates that interest rates are not going to come down rapidly. When interest rates are relatively high, banks and other financial institutions generally see increased profitability due to increased lending rates. The gap between such lending rates is considered a long-term asset for banks. Also, short-term liabilities such as deposits increase and boost net interest margins. Bank stocks, insurance companies and other financial institutions go up with continuous interest rate hikes. This is because financial services companies can earn more on their money and the credit they issue to their customers. The sector has been a strong performer in 2024, delivering solid returns. Early concerns in the year about the collapse of several small to mid-cap banks were overshadowed by optimism about an improving economy and lower borrowing costs. As a result, the S&P 500 Financials Select Sector SPDR (XLF) soared 30.4% year to date as of Dec. 30. Also, financial stocks are very popular investments on their own. Most companies within the sector issue dividends and are judged on the overall strength of their financial health. It is thus prudent to add a few to one\u2019s portfolio.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting. GAAP includes the standards, conventions, and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions and in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, this earnings release includes non-GAAP financial measures, which the Company believes are useful to help investors better understand its financial performance, competitive position and prospects for the future. These non-GAAP measures include adjusted net earnings per share, adjusted pre-tax title earnings, adjusted pre-tax title earnings as a percentage of adjusted title revenue (adjusted pre-tax title margin), adjusted net earnings attributable to common shareholders (adjusted net earnings), assets under management (AUM), average assets under management (AAUM) and sales. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful in certain instances to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods.\u00a0 Our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other organizations because other organizations may not calculate such non-GAAP measures in the same manner as we do. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation of or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\u00a0 By disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures, FNF believes it offers investors a greater understanding of, and an enhanced level of transparency into, the means by which the Company's management operates the Company. Any non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP net earnings, net earnings attributable to common shareholders, net earnings per share, or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance or liquidity. Further, FNF's non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided below. Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements regarding our expectations, hopes, intentions or strategies regarding the future are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on management's beliefs, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. Because such statements are based on expectations as to future financial and operating results and are not statements of fact, actual results may differ materially from those projected. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The risks and uncertainties which forward-looking statements are subject to include, but are not limited to: changes in general economic, business, political crisis, war and pandemic conditions, including ongoing geopolitical conflicts; weakness or adverse changes in the level of real estate activity, which may be caused by, among other things, high or increasing interest rates, a limited supply of mortgage funding or a weak U.S. economy; our potential inability to find suitable acquisition candidates; our dependence on distributions from our title insurance underwriters as a main source of cash flow; significant competition that F&G and our operating subsidiaries face; compliance with extensive government regulation of our operating subsidiaries, including regulation of title insurance and services and privacy and data protection laws; systems damage, failures, interruptions, cyberattacks and intrusions, or unauthorized data disclosures; and other risks detailed in the \"Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information,\" \"Risk Factors\" and other sections of FNF's Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Non-GAAP financial measure. See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for additional information. DEFINITIONS The following represents the definitions of non-GAAP measures used by the Company. Adjusted Net Earnings attributable to common shareholders Adjusted net earnings attributable to common shareholders is a non-GAAP economic measure we use to evaluate financial performance each period. Adjusted net earnings attributable to common shareholders is calculated by adjusting net earnings (loss) attributable to common shareholders to eliminate: i. Recognized (gains) and losses, net: the impact of net investment gains/losses, including changes in allowance for expected credit losses and other than temporary impairment (\"OTTI\") losses, recognized in operations; and the effects of changes in fair value of the reinsurance related embedded derivative and other derivatives, including interest rate swaps and forwards; ii. Market related liability adjustments: the impacts related to changes in the fair value, including both realized and unrealized gains and losses, of index product related derivatives and embedded derivatives, net of hedging cost; the impact of initial pension risk transfer deferred profit liability losses, including amortization from previously deferred pension risk transfer deferred profit liability losses; and the changes in the fair value of market risk benefits by deferring current period changes and amortizing that amount over the life of the market risk benefit; iii. Purchase price amortization: the impacts related to the amortization of certain intangibles (internally developed software, trademarks and value of distribution asset and the change in fair value of liabilities recognized as a result of acquisition activities); iv. Transaction costs: the impacts related to acquisition, integration and merger related items; v. Certain income tax adjustments: the impacts related to unusual tax items that do not reflect our core operating performance such as the establishment or reversal of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances in our Title and Corporate and Other segments; vi. Other \"non-recurring,\" \"infrequent\" or \"unusual items\":\u00a0 Management excludes certain items determined to be \"non-recurring,\" \"infrequent\" or \"unusual\" from adjusted net earnings when incurred if it is determined these expenses are not a reflection of the core business and when the nature of the item is such that it is not reasonably likely to recur within two years and/or there was not a similar item in the preceding two years; vii. Non-controlling interest on non-GAAP adjustments: the portion of the non-GAAP adjustments attributable to the equity interest of entities that\u00a0FNF does not wholly own; and viii. Income taxes: the income tax impact related to the above-mentioned adjustments is measured using an effective tax rate, as appropriate by tax jurisdiction While these adjustments are an integral part of the overall performance of F&G, market conditions and/or the non-operating nature of these items can overshadow the underlying performance of the core business. Accordingly, management considers this to be a useful measure internally and to investors and analysts in analyzing the trends of our operations. Adjusted net earnings should not be used as a substitute for net earnings (loss). However, we believe the adjustments made to net earnings (loss) in order to derive adjusted net earnings provide an understanding of our overall results of operations. Assets Under Management (AUM) AUM is comprised of the following components and is reported net of reinsurance assets ceded in accordance with GAAP: i. total invested assets at amortized cost, excluding investments in unconsolidated affiliates, owned distribution and derivatives; ii. investments in unconsolidated affiliates at carrying value; iii. related party loans and investments; iv. accrued investment income; v. the net payable/receivable for the purchase/sale of investments; and vi. cash and cash equivalents excluding derivative collateral at the end of the period. Management considers this non-GAAP financial measure to be useful internally and to investors and analysts when assessing the size of our investment portfolio that is retained. AUM before Flow Reinsurance AUM before Flow Reinsurance is comprised of components consistent with AUM, but also includes flow reinsured assets. Management considers this non-GAAP financial measure to be useful internally and to investors and analysts when assessing the size of our investment portfolio including reinsured assets. Average Assets Under Management (AAUM) AAUM is calculated as AUM at the beginning of the period and the end of each month in the period, divided by the total number of months in the period plus one. Management considers this non-GAAP financial measure to be useful internally and to investors and analysts when assessing the rate of return on retained assets. Sales Annuity, IUL, funding agreement and non-life contingent PRT sales are not derived from any specific GAAP income statement accounts or line items and should not be viewed as a substitute for any financial measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Sales from these products are recorded as deposit liabilities (i.e., contractholder funds) within the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Life contingent PRT sales are recorded as premiums in revenues within the consolidated financial statements. Management believes that presentation of sales, as measured for management purposes, enhances the understanding of our business and helps depict longer term trends that may not be apparent in the results of operations due to the timing of sales and revenue recognition.

Inc.'s (NYSE:FNF) Weak Fundamentals Mean That The Stock Could Move In The Opposite Direction? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Mon, Dec 9, 2024, 2:20 PM 4 min read In This Article: FNF -0.91% Fidelity National Financial's (NYSE:FNF) stock up by 5.4% over the past three months. Given that the markets usually pay for the long-term financial health of a company, we wonder if the current momentum in the share price will keep up, given that the company's financials don't look very promising. In this article, we decided to focus on Fidelity National Financial's ROE. Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Fidelity National Financial How To Calculate Return On Equity? The formula for ROE is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Fidelity National Financial is: 8.6% = US$769m \u00f7 US$8.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024). The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.09 in profit. What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth? So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics. Fidelity National Financial's Earnings Growth And 8.6% ROE At first glance, Fidelity National Financial's ROE doesn't look very promising. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 14%. For this reason, Fidelity National Financial's five year net income decline of 8.2% is not surprising given its lower ROE. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. Such as - low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital. However, when we compared Fidelity National Financial's growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 13% in the same period. This is quite worrisome. NYSE:FNF Past Earnings Growth December 9th 2024 Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is FNF worth today? The intrinsic value infographic in our free research report helps visualize whether FNF is currently mispriced by the market. Story Continues Is Fidelity National Financial Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits? Fidelity National Financial's declining earnings is not surprising given how the company is spending most of its profits in paying dividends, judging by its three-year median payout ratio of 56% (or a retention ratio of 44%). The business is only left with a small pool of capital to reinvest - A vicious cycle that doesn't benefit the company in the long-run. In addition, Fidelity National Financial has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 30% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 18%, over the same period. Conclusion On the whole, Fidelity National Financial's performance is quite a big let-down. As a result of its low ROE and lack of much reinvestment into the business, the company has seen a disappointing earnings growth rate. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

the latest 10-Q filing. Financial overview highlights FNF's robust title insurance segment and strategic acquisitions. Expert insights into FNF's market positioning, investment portfolio, and regulatory challenges. Forward-looking strategies to leverage strengths and mitigate risks. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Sign with FNF. On November 7, 2024, Fidelity National Financial Inc ( NYSE:FNF ) filed its 10-Q report, offering a detailed glimpse into its financial performance and strategic direction. As a leading provider of title insurance, escrow, and other related services, FNF continues to dominate the U.S. market. The filing reveals a company with a strong title insurance segment, bolstered by strategic acquisitions and a diversified investment portfolio. However, FNF also faces regulatory scrutiny and market challenges that could impact future performance. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as presented in the recent SEC filing, providing investors with a comprehensive understanding of FNF's current position and future prospects. Decoding Fidelity National Financial Inc (FNF): A Strategic SWOT Insight Strengths Market Leadership and Brand Recognition: FNF's title insurance segment remains a cornerstone of its success, contributing significantly to its revenue stream. The company's well-established brand and market leadership are underscored by its expansive network of underwriters, including Fidelity National Title Insurance Company, Chicago Title Insurance Company, and others. This network not only ensures a broad market reach but also enhances FNF's ability to deliver comprehensive services across the United States. The recent acquisition of PALH, LLC, which expands FNF's distribution through a network of agents, further solidifies its market presence and brand equity. Robust Financial Performance: The financial tables in the 10-Q filing highlight FNF's solid financial footing. With a substantial increase in its investment portfolio's fair value from $52 billion to $59 billion within the year, FNF demonstrates a strong balance sheet and investment acumen. The company's strategic issuance of senior notes, such as the 6.25% F&G Senior Notes and the 6.50% F&G Senior Notes, has allowed for the refinancing of existing debts and support for organic growth opportunities, showcasing prudent financial management and a commitment to maintaining financial flexibility. Weaknesses Regulatory Challenges: FNF operates in a highly regulated industry, and the 10-Q filing indicates that compliance with federal and state statutes and regulations could increase operational costs or limit the provision of certain products and services. The potential for regulatory changes, such as those affecting title insurance or mortgage servicing, poses a risk to FNF's business model and could impact its competitive position. Moreover, the ongoing inquiries and investigations by regulatory agencies, including the CFPB, add a layer of uncertainty to FNF's operations. Story Continues Dependence on Key Relationships: FNF's business is significantly influenced by its relationships with lenders, servicers, and government-sponsored enterprises. Changes in these relationships, whether due to market dynamics or regulatory shifts, could adversely affect the volume of business FNF receives. The 10-Q filing acknowledges that the loss of business from these parties or revisions to their guidelines could materially impact FNF's operations and financial results. Opportunities Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships: FNF's recent acquisitions, such as the purchase of PALH, LLC, demonstrate its commitment to growth through strategic partnerships and market expansion. These acquisitions not only enhance FNF's product offerings but also provide access to new customer segments. The company's ability to identify and integrate complementary businesses presents an opportunity to further solidify its market leadership and diversify revenue streams. Investment Portfolio Diversification: FNF's investment portfolio, valued at approximately $59 billion, is well-diversified across asset classes and sectors, including corporate securities, U.S. government and agency securities, and structured securities. This diversification strategy mitigates risk and positions FNF to capitalize on favorable market conditions. The company's disciplined investment approach, as evidenced by its portfolio's performance, offers the potential for continued financial stability and growth. Threats Market Volatility and Economic Uncertainty: The real estate and financial markets are subject to cyclical fluctuations and economic uncertainty, which can impact FNF's title insurance and mortgage servicing businesses. The 10-Q filing highlights the potential for market volatility to affect demand for FNF's products and services, as well as the value of its investment portfolio. Economic downturns or disruptions in the real estate market could lead to reduced transaction volumes and pressure on revenue. Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Concerns: FNF, like many financial services companies, faces threats related to cybersecurity and data privacy. The 10-Q filing references a consolidated putative nationwide class action related to a data security breach, underscoring the reputational and financial risks associated with such incidents. As FNF continues to expand its digital offerings, maintaining robust cybersecurity measures and safeguarding customer data remain critical to mitigating these threats. In conclusion, Fidelity National Financial Inc ( NYSE:FNF ) exhibits a strong market position with a robust financial performance, underpinned by strategic acquisitions and a diversified investment portfolio. However, regulatory challenges and dependence on key relationships are areas that require vigilant management. Opportunities for growth through strategic partnerships and investment portfolio diversification are promising, while market volatility and cybersecurity threats pose ongoing concerns. FNF's forward-looking strategies, including its focus on organic growth and prudent financial management, are essential to leveraging its strengths and addressing potential risks.

{"text": "3 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks: A Smarter Way to Boost Your Retirement Income Zacks Equity Research Mon, Dec 23, 2024, 5:10 PM 4 min read Here's a revealing data point: older Americans are scared more of outliving wealth than of death itself. And older Americans have legitimate reasons for this worry, even if they have dutifully saved for their golden years. That's because the traditional ways people manage retirement may no longer provide enough income to meet expenses - and with people generally living longer, the principal retirement savings is exhausted far too early in the retirement period. Your parents' retirement investing plan won't cut it today. For many years, bonds or other fixed-income assets could produce the yield needed to provide solid income for retirement needs. However, these yields have dwindled over time: 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s were around 6.50%, but today, that rate is a thing of the past, with a slim likelihood of rates making a comeback in the foreseeable future. The impact of this rate decline is sizable: over 20 years, the difference in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is more than $1 million. Today's retirees are getting hit hard by reduced bond yields - and the Social Security picture isn't too rosy either. Right now and for the near future, Social Security benefits are still being paid, but it has been estimated that the Social Security funds will be depleted as soon as 2035. How can you avoid dipping into your principal when the investments you counted on in retirement aren't producing income? You can only cut your expenses so far, and the only other option is to find a different investment vehicle to generate income. Invest in Dividend Stocks We feel that these dividend-paying equities - as long as they are from high-quality, low-risk issuers - can give retirement investors a smart option to replace low-yielding Treasury bonds (or other bonds). Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions. Going beyond those familiar names, you can find excellent dividend-paying stocks by following a few guidelines. Look for companies that pay a dividend yield of around 3%, with positive annual dividend growth. The growth rate is key to help combat the effects of inflation. Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio. Brixmor Property (BRX) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.29 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.98%. This compares to the REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry's yield of 3.82% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.54%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 4.81%. Check Brixmor Property dividend history here>>> Story Continues Community Trust Bancorp (CTBI) is paying out a dividend of $0.47 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.46% compared to the Banks - Southeast industry's yield of 2.21% and the S&P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 2.17% over the past year. Check Community Trust Bancorp dividend history here>>> Currently paying a dividend of $0.5 per share, FNF Group (FNF) has a dividend yield of 3.56%. This is compared to the Insurance - Property and Casualty industry's yield of 0.13% and the S&P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 6.67%. Check FNF Group dividend history here>>> But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds? It is true that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds, but high-quality dividend stocks not only have the ability to produce income growth over time but more importantly, can also reduce your overall portfolio volatility relative to the broader stock market. Combating the impact of inflation is one advantage of owning these dividend-paying stocks. Here's why: many of these stable, high-quality companies increase their dividends over time, which translates to rising dividend income that offsets the effects of inflation. Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees. If you're thinking, \"I want to invest in a dividend-focused ETF or mutual fund,\" make sure to do your homework. It's important to know that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs charge high fees, which may diminish your dividend gains or income and thwart the overall objective of this investment strategy. If you do want to invest in fund, research well to identify the best-quality dividend funds with the least charges. Bottom Line Pursuing a dividend investing strategy can help protect your retirement portfolio. Whether you choose to invest in stocks or through low-fee mutual funds or ETFs, this approach can potentially help you achieve a more secure and enjoyable retirement.
