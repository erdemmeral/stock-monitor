[{"text": "3 Reasons to Avoid ENTG and 1 Stock to Buy Instead Anthony Lee Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 12:09 PM 3 min read In This Article: ENTG -2.05% 3 Reasons to Avoid ENTG and 1 Stock to Buy Instead Entegris has gotten torched over the last six months - since July 2024, its stock price has dropped 21.3% to $100.53 per share. This was partly driven by its softer quarterly results and may have investors wondering how to approach the situation. Is there a buying opportunity in Entegris, or does it present a risk to your portfolio? Get the full breakdown from our expert analysts, it\u2019s free . Even though the stock has become cheaper, we don't have much confidence in Entegris. Here are three reasons why there are better opportunities than ENTG and a stock we'd rather own. Why Is Entegris Not Exciting? With fabs representing the company\u2019s largest customer type, Entegris (NASDAQ:ENTG) supplies products that purify, protect, and generally ensure the integrity of raw materials needed for advanced semiconductor manufacturing. 1. Lackluster Revenue Growth We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within semiconductors, a stretched historical view may miss new demand cycles or industry trends like AI. Entegris\u2019s recent history shows its demand slowed significantly as its annualized revenue growth of 3.8% over the last two years is well below its five-year trend. Entegris Year-On-Year Revenue Growth 2. Operating Margin Falling Operating margin is a key measure of profitability. Think of it as net income - the bottom line - excluding the impact of taxes and interest on debt, which are less connected to business fundamentals. Looking at the trend in its profitability, Entegris\u2019s operating margin decreased by 5.6 percentage points over the last five years. The company\u2019s performance was poor no matter how you look at it. It shows operating expenses were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass those costs onto its customers. Its operating margin for the trailing 12 months was 15.1%. Entegris Operating Margin (GAAP) 3. Free Cash Flow Margin Dropping Free cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king. As you can see below, Entegris\u2019s margin dropped by 6.6 percentage points over the last five years. It may have ticked higher more recently, but shareholders are likely hoping for its margin to at least revert to its historical level. Almost any movement in the wrong direction is undesirable because of its relatively low cash conversion. If the longer-term trend returns, it could signal it\u2019s becoming a more capital-intensive business. Entegris\u2019s free cash flow margin for the trailing 12 months was 8.4%. Entegris Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin Final Judgment Entegris\u2019s business quality ultimately falls short of our standards. After the recent drawdown, the stock trades at 25.7\u00d7 forward price-to-earnings (or $100.53 per share). Investors with a higher risk tolerance might like the company, but we don\u2019t really see a big opportunity at the moment. We're pretty confident there are superior stocks to buy right now. We\u2019d suggest looking at one of our top software and edge computing picks .

(NASDAQ:ENTG) Delivered A Weaker ROE Than Its Industry editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sat, Jan 25, 2025, 4:42 PM 3 min read In This Article: ENTG -2.05% While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. We'll use ROE to examine Entegris, Inc. ( NASDAQ:ENTG ), by way of a worked example. Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Entegris How Is ROE Calculated? The formula for return on equity is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Entegris is: 6.4% = US$229m \u00f7 US$3.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024). The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.06 in profit. Does Entegris Have A Good ROE? One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below, Entegris has a lower ROE than the average (11%) in the Semiconductor industry classification. NasdaqGS:ENTG Return on Equity January 25th 2025 That certainly isn't ideal. That being said, a low ROE is not always a bad thing, especially if the company has low leverage as this still leaves room for improvement if the company were to take on more debt. When a company has low ROE but high debt levels, we would be cautious as the risk involved is too high. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Entegris visit our risks dashboard for free. Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROE Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking. Entegris' Debt And Its 6.4% ROE It's worth noting the high use of debt by Entegris, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.15. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it. Story Continues Summary Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better. Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 5 Growth Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Strong Momentum Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our 9 Best Market-Beating Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

In This Article: ENTG -2.05% https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/f5-networks-price-target-raised-to-270-from-240-at-evercore-isi Mizuho lowered the firm\u2019s price target on Entegris ( ENTG ) to $120 from $125 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. In conjunction with its 2025 outlook for the chemicals packaging space, the firm reduced estimates and price targets for several stocks. The March quarter \u201cappears set to begin as weak\u201d as the December quarter ended for most stocks, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Mizuho also updated its top picks, returning DuPont (DD) to top pick replacing Air Products (APD) with Linde (LIN). Each of these stocks are relatively defensive at attractive valuations, contends Mizuho. The firm\u2019s only picks in basic chemicals and agriculture remain Westlake (WLK) and Corteva (CTVA). It recommends most consumer-facing chemicals and packaging, although none are top picks.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our 9 Best Market-Beating Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 5 Quality Compounder Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Hidden Gem Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Zacks Equity Research Mon, Dec 30, 2024, 7:40 PM 2 min read In This Article: ENTG -2.05% MKSI -1.90% Investors looking for stocks in the Electronics - Manufacturing Machinery sector might want to consider either MKS Instruments (MKSI) or Entegris (ENTG). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out. Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits. Currently, MKS Instruments has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Entegris has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that MKSI is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in. Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels. Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use. MKSI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 16.75, while ENTG has a forward P/E of 34.51. We also note that MKSI has a PEG ratio of 0.62. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. ENTG currently has a PEG ratio of 1.70. Another notable valuation metric for MKSI is its P/B ratio of 2.98. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ENTG has a P/B of 4.28. These metrics, and several others, help MKSI earn a Value grade of A, while ENTG has been given a Value grade of C. MKSI is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that MKSI is likely the superior value option right now. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Below is a weekly roundup of what happened this week in the cannabis and psychedelic sectors. In this ever-evolving landscape, we explore the major developments and groundbreaking initiatives happening among companies operating in these industries; from advancements in medical research, therapeutic applications to shifts in legal frameworks and current market trends. Top Marijuana Companies for the Week #1: Vireo Growth Minnesota-based cannabis multistate operator Vireo Growth Inc. ( CSE: VREO ) ( OTCQX: VREOF ) successfully raised $81 million in an oversubscribed funding round, surpassing its initial target of $75 million. The funding round, which concluded on December 30, involved the issuance of 129.5 million new shares priced at $0.625 each. According to the company, the proceeds from the raise will be directed toward business development, including organic and acquisitive growth, working capital, and general corporate purposes. Vireo\u2019s newly appointed CEO, John Mazarakis, who also co-founded Chicago Atlantic, described the raise as \u201cthe beginning of a new chapter for Vireo.\u201d As part of its aggressive expansion strategy, Vireo recently announced four major acquisitions valued at nearly $400 million, executed entirely as stock-based deals. These acquisitions included Deep Roots Harvest in Nevada, Proper Brands in Missouri, WholesomeCo Cannabis in Utah, and The Flowery in Florida. Additionally, the company also acquired Arches, a delivery and analytics platform that it developed and spun out in 2023. This platform will be exclusively licensed to Vireo\u2019s portfolio of companies as regulations evolve. Once these deals close, which is expected within six months, Vireo\u2019s operational footprint will expand to seven states, featuring nine cultivation facilities, 48 retail outlets, and over 1 million square feet of cultivation canopy. Chicago Atlantic, which is a cannabis-focused investment firm and Vireo\u2019s largest shareholder, played a crucial role in structuring the funding round and acquisition deals. \u201cThis partnership strengthens our ability to execute strategic investments and position ourselves as a leader in the cannabis industry,\u201d Mazarakis stated. Story Continues The company also announced significant leadership changes, including Mazarakis stepping into the CEO role and additional C-suite adjustments designed to align with Vireo\u2019s growth and integration objectives. #2: iAnthus iAnthus Capital Holdings, Inc. ( CSE: IAN ) ( OTCQB: ITHUF ) , a multistate cannabis operator, recently announced the acquisition of Cheetah Enterprises Inc. , an Illinois-based vape brand known for its premium live-resin products. The all-stock deal is valued at $1.5 million, with additional non-material cash payments tied to performance benchmarks extending through April 2028. According to iAnthus, the acquisition aligns with the company\u2019s strategy to expand its portfolio of marijuana brands and drive long-term growth. By integrating Cheetah, iAnthus will enhance its presence in the Illinois and Pennsylvania cannabis markets, with plans for further expansion through 2025. \u201cWe are building a platform where bold brands can thrive, and Cheetah fits that mold perfectly,\u201d said Richard Proud, CEO of iAnthus. He added, \u201cCheetah\u2019s innovative approach to the vape market mirrors the agility, precision, and speed with which we\u2019re building iAnthus. This acquisition gives us the momentum to win with consumers, expand into new markets, and bring top-industry talent into our organization.\u201d Cheetah is recognized for its innovative and high-quality live resin vapes, which are often sourced from various cultivator strains. A unique aspect of the brand is its commitment to donating a portion of its proceeds to the Cheetah Conservation Fund . Under terms of the deal, Cheetah co-founder and CEO Michael Piermont will join iAnthus as Chief Commercial Officer. Piermont also expressed excitement about the partnership, stating, \u201cFrom day one, Cheetah\u2019s mission has been about being fearless, fast, and innovative to our consumers \u2013 qualities that clearly align with iAnthus\u2019 vision for the future of cannabis.\u201d This acquisition is expected to boost iAnthus\u2019 revenue growth and provide Cheetah with the resources and distribution network needed to expand its market penetration in Illinois and other key regions. Despite its growth initiatives, iAnthus continues to face financial challenges, last month the company reported a working capital deficit of $31.4 million and an accumulated deficit of $1.3 billion as of the third quarter of last year. The company also reported a 6.3% revenue drop in the same quarter. Nonetheless, iAnthus continues to navigate financial hurdles as it builds a more robust brand portfolio. #3: Entourage Health Canadian cannabis producer Entourage Health Corp. ( TSXV: ENTG ) ( OTCQX: ETRGF ) , formerly known as WeedMD , recently announced a definitive agreement to go private . Under the agreement, LiUNA Pension Fund of Central and Eastern Canada (LPFCEC) will acquire all outstanding shares of Entourage for C$0.005 per share, marking a critical step in resolving the company\u2019s ongoing financial struggles. Entourage has been facing significant financial challenges, including C$167.6 million in debt under credit agreements with LPFCEC. The company breached debt covenants in April 2024 and has since relied on multiple forbearance extensions, with the latest waiver set to expire on January 15, 2025. Jason Alexander, Chair of Entourage\u2019s special committee, emphasized that the transaction offers \u201cthe most favorable outcome for the company and its shareholders in light of the current challenges.\u201d The company\u2019s financial instability was further highlighted in the third quarter 2024 financial results , when the company reported a C$171.4 million working capital deficit and C$390.5 million in accumulated losses as of September 30, 2024. Despite a modest 11% increase in third-quarter revenue to C$13.6 million, Entourage reported C$8.3 million in quarterly losses, highlighting the urgent need for financial intervention. The transaction requires approval from two-thirds of shareholders at a special meeting, which is scheduled for February 2025. Insiders, who collectively hold 27% of the shares, have already committed their support to the deal through voting agreements. Upon completion, Entourage\u2019s shares will be delisted from the TSX Venture Exchange, and the company will cease being a reporting issuer under Canadian securities law. Entourage operates a 26,000-square-foot medical cannabis processing facility in Aylmer, Ontario, through its Starseed brand, which maintains an exclusive partnership with LiUNA. By going private, the company aims to stabilize its operations and address its substantial debt load while providing shareholders with immediate liquidity. #4: Cansortium Florida-based Cansortium Inc. ( CSE: TIUM.U ) ( OTCQB: CNTMF ) , which operates under the Fluent brand, recently announced that it had completed its merger with New York-based RIV Capital Inc. , marking a significant milestone in the cannabis industry. This merger expanded Fluent\u2019s footprint to include 42 dispensaries across four states; Florida, Pennsylvania, Texas, and New York along with eight cultivation and processing facilities. The combined company aims to capitalize on the rapidly growing cannabis market in New York and enhance its overall operational capabilities. As part of the merger, shareholders of Cansortium now hold 51.25% of the new entity, while RIV Capital shareholders own 48.75%. The merger also eliminated $160 million in company debt, which was aided by the conversion of shares and the $33 million in liquidity brought in by RIV Capital. Additionally, Cansortium\u2019s CEO since 2020, Robert Beasley, will lead the combined company, while RIV Capital\u2019s interim CEO, David Vautrin, will serve as chief commercial officer. The merger granted Fluent immediate access to New York\u2019s fast-growing adult-use cannabis market, where RIV Capital operates the Etain marijuana brand, which was acquired from Etain Health for $247 million in 2022. Beasley emphasized the importance of this expansion, stating, \u201cNot only does this move accelerate Fluent\u2019s entry into one of the largest and fastest-growing cannabis markets in the world, but it expands our retail door count to 42, adding our first wholesale division and expanding our house of brands.\u201d Financially, the merger positions Fluent for sustainable growth. The company secured a $96.5 million senior credit agreement in November, and plans to use these funds, along with RIV\u2019s cash reserves, to explore strategic acquisitions in key markets such as New York and Pennsylvania. And despite both companies reporting significant losses in the third quarter of 2024; $11.7 million for Cansortium and $63.4 million for RIV Capital, their combined resources and operational expertise are expected to drive long-term profitability and cash generation. This merger also highlighted the ongoing trend of consolidation within the cannabis industry, as companies join forces to pool resources and remain competitive in an increasingly regulated and crowded market. A notable beneficiary of this deal is The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company ( NYSE: SMG ) , which has been expanding its influence in the cannabis sector. Through its subsidiary, The Hawthorne Collective , Scotts Miracle-Gro holds a significant stake in the newly formed Fluent, further solidifying its position in this evolving industry. Top Psychedelic Company for Week #1: Awakn Awakn Life Sciences Corp. ( CSE: AWKN ) ( OTC: AWKNF ) , a biotechnology company developing therapeutics for substance use and mental health disorders, recently announced it had entered into a binding letter of intent with Graft Polymer (UK) PLC , under which Graft will acquire all of Awakn\u2019s outstanding shares in an all-stock deal valued at C$8.8 million. Graft, which is a UK-based biotechnology company, is also focused on developing therapeutics for mental health and substance use disorders. The acquisition comes after a commercial collaboration between the two companies earlier in 2024, which paved the way for the deal. Under the terms of the agreement, Awakn shareholders will receive 46.67 ordinary shares of Graft for each share they hold. Additionally, outstanding restricted share units and deferred share units will also be converted into Graft shares. The deal is expected to close by June 2025, pending approval from both companies\u2019 boards, shareholders, and regulators. Awakn\u2019s research and clinical programs, particularly in substance use and mental health, are expected to enhance Graft\u2019s therapeutic pipeline. And therefore, this acquisition is seen as a strategic move to expand Graft\u2019s focus on addressing global mental health and addiction challenges. Graft\u2019s Chairman, Dennis Purcell, emphasized the significance of this deal saying; \u201cThis proposed acquisition marks an important milestone for Graft Polymer as we broaden our focus to address the pressing global challenges of addiction and mental health disorders. Awakn\u2019s advanced research and clinical programs offer the potential to develop more effective and accessible treatments for these critical areas of need. We believe this strategic move will not only drive value for our shareholders but also contribute meaningfully to improving the lives of millions impacted by these conditions.\u201d George Scorsis, Chairman of Awakn\u2019s Board of Directors, also expressed his enthusiasm for the deal, stating, \u201cThis proposed acquisition by Graft Polymer marks a significant milestone for Awakn Life Sciences and our mission to provide breakthrough therapeutics for substance use and other mental health disorders. We have had a significant portion of our operations in the UK for the entire life of our business, and following completion of the Proposed Transaction, Awakn will have access to the UK\u2019s deep pool of liquidity as well as the international investor base positioned in London. We believe this transaction will create long-term value for our shareholders and provide new opportunities for growth and collaboration.\u201d Anthony Tennyson, CEO of Awakn, also weighed in, stating, \u201cI\u2019m excited about the opportunity for Awakn to join forces with Graft Polymer. This acquisition positions us to better leverage our resources and expertise in the UK, expanding our capacity to deliver new therapeutics for addiction and mental health challenges.\u201d Awakn\u2019s recent financial performance has been challenging, with the company reporting a net loss of C$376,126 for the most recent quarter. Despite this, the acquisition is viewed as a step toward long-term value creation.
