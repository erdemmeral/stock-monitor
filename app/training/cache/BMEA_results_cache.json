[{"text": "Biomea Fusion to Become a Diabetes & Obesity Medicines Company Biomea Fusion, Inc. Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 5:00 PM 8 min read In This Article: BMEA -5.98% Biomea Fusion, Inc. Icovamenib & BMF-650 (oral small molecule GLP-1) are the cornerstones of the metabolic franchise Biomea preparing icovamenib for late-stage clinical development 2025 corporate update to be presented at the 43 rd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference REDWOOD CITY, Calif., Jan. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biomea Fusion, Inc. (\u201cBiomea\u201d or \u201cBiomea Fusion\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d) (Nasdaq: BMEA), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering and developing oral covalent small molecules to improve the lives of patients announced today that the company will become a diabetes and obesity medicines company. Based on the most recent clinical trial results, the strategic focus for icovamenib will be in metabolic disorders. The company will prioritize insulin deficient patients and combination strategies with GLP-1-based therapies for obesity and diabetes. Biomea plans to conclude its studies exploring icovamenib\u2019s potential in oncology and explore partnerships to further advance its oncology assets, while concentrating internal resources on metabolic disorders. Icovamenib, a potential first-in-class menin inhibitor for the treatment of diabetes, demonstrated the strongest activity in patients with the lowest insulin production Placebo adjusted 1.5% mean reduction in HbA1c (a measure of blood glucose control) in severe insulin deficient patients uncontrolled on one or more antidiabetic agents at baseline. Icovamenib showed strong activity in patients uncontrolled on GLP-1-based therapies Placebo adjusted mean HbA1c reduction of 1.0% in patients suboptimally controlled at baseline with GLP-1-based therapies, consistent with preclinical findings demonstrating enhanced GLP-1 receptor expression and increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion with the combination of icovamenib and a GLP-1-based therapy such as semaglutide. Icovamenib demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefits validating the mechanism of action Greater clinical benefits were achieved in patients who were most insulin deficient. Icovamenib achieved these results while patients were off treatment for 14 weeks Patients received icovamenib for only 12 weeks, with a primary follow up at Week 26. Icovamenib was well tolerated and demonstrated a favorable safety profile No adverse-event related discontinuations, hypoglycemic events, or serious adverse events were reported. In the prespecified subgroup of severely insulin deficient patients, all patients (100%) responded to 100mg of icovamenib for 12 weeks, displaying a durable reduction in HbA1c 14 weeks after treatment completion, with a continued decline in mean HbA1c while off therapy. In the United States and Europe, these patients represent approximately 20% of the type 2 diabetes patient population. They typically have the lowest insulin production, highest unmet medical need, highest all-cause mortality and worst cardiovascular outcomes. These patients can be easily identified using their HbA1c and body mass index (BMI). These results give us great hope to have identified a pathway with the potential to address diabetes at the root cause level, the depleted pool and function of beta cells. We plan to present further results of the COVALENT-111 trial at an upcoming medical conference. Story Continues In preclinical in vivo studies of icovamenib in combination with GLP-1-based therapies, icovamenib demonstrated encouraging metabolic benefits, including superior glycemic control, enhanced beta cell function, significant body weight reduction and improved lean muscle mass. We believe these findings not only underscore the potential for icovamenib to enhance GLP-1-based therapies but also highlight its promise as a disease-modifying agent. Further clinical evaluation will follow, with additional insights anticipated during the J.P. Morgan Conference. Biomea will discuss its clinical plan with FDA to support these two patient groups and move into late-stage development. The current plan includes the following two clinical trials: Phase 2/3 (adaptive design): icovamenib in patients with insulin deficient type 2 diabetes (HbA1c \u22658.5% and BMI <32 kg/m 2 ), uncontrolled at baseline on current antidiabetic medication Phase 2b: icovamenib in combination with a GLP-1- based therapy in patients uncontrolled on a GLP-1-based therapy at baseline and in patients initiating a GLP-1-based therapy \u201cWe are excited to focus our efforts on metabolic disorders and to accelerate the development of icovamenib in 2025,\u201d said Thomas Butler, Chief Executive Officer of Biomea Fusion. \u201cOur decision reflects the significant potential we see in addressing the insulin deficient patients and those initiating or failing on a GLP-1-based therapy. Today we have a clear understanding of where our menin inhibitor icovamenib has the most impact and which patient population has the most potential benefit. We can easily identify those patients using HbA1c and BMI alone. Icovamenib was only dosed for 12 weeks in our study COVALENT-111, yet we saw continued reductions in HbA1c 3 months thereafter. We look forward to seeing the 52-week data as we expect the responses to further deepen beyond Week 26.\u201d JP Morgan Presentation Information Thomas Butler, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, will present on the company and its plans for 2025 at the 43rd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference on Wednesday, January 15, 2025, at 1:30 PM Pacific Time / 4:30 PM Eastern Time. Additionally, Biomea\u2019s management team will be hosting one-on-one meetings throughout the conference, taking place from January 13 to January 16. A live audio webcast of the presentation can be accessed here or by visiting the Investors & Media section of Biomea\u2019s website at https://investors.biomeafusion.com/news-events/events. A replay of the webcast will be available following the live presentation. About Icovamenib Icovamenib is an investigational, orally bioavailable, potent, and selective covalent inhibitor of menin. The molecule was built using Biomea Fusion\u2019s FUSION\u2122 System and is designed to regenerate insulin-producing beta cells with the aim to cure diabetes. Icovamenib\u2019s proposed mechanism of action in diabetes is to enable the proliferation, preservation, and reactivation of a patient\u2019s own healthy, functional, insulin-producing beta cells. As the potentially first disease-modifying therapy for type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, icovamenib could become an important addition and complement to the diabetes treatment landscape once it has successfully completed its ongoing clinical studies. About Biomea Fusion Biomea Fusion is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of oral covalent small molecules to improve the lives of patients with diabetes, obesity, and genetically defined cancers. A covalent small molecule is a synthetic compound that forms a permanent bond to its target protein and offers a number of potential advantages over conventional non-covalent drugs, including greater target selectivity, lower drug exposure, and the ability to drive a deeper, more durable response. We are utilizing our proprietary FUSION\u2122 System to discover, design and develop a pipeline of next-generation covalent-binding small-molecule medicines designed to maximize clinical benefit for patients.

(NASDAQ:BMEA) Is Among the Best Diabetes Stocks to Buy Under $10 Laiba Immad Mon, Jan 6, 2025, 5:04 PM 6 min read In This Article: BMEA -5.98% We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Diabetes Stocks To Buy Under $10 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Biomea Fusion, Inc. (NASDAQ:BMEA) stands against the other diabetes stocks. Global Growth and Innovation in Diabetes Care: The Rise of Continuous Glucose Monitors and AI Integration About 422 million people worldwide have diabetes, according to the WHO, and most of them live in low- or middle-income nations. Every year, diabetes directly causes 1.5 million deaths on average. Both the number of cases and the prevalence of diabetes have steadily increased during the last several decades. However, according to the International Diabetes Federation, there are currently 500 million people with diabetes globally, and that number is expected to rise by 25% by 2030 and 51% by 2045. The continuous glucose monitor (CGM) is one type of medical equipment used to help manage diabetes, including type 1 and type 2. It is now a rapidly growing segment of diabetic care devices, and the market has increased significantly in recent years. According to GlobalData, the demand for sophisticated diabetes care products, such as insulin pumps, pens, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices, was projected to be valued at $21.8 billion in 2023. According to GlobalData's forecasts, the market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.34% to reach revenues of $33.4 billion by 2030. There are now 97 goods in the CGM category, according to the GlobalData marketed products database. Only a small number of these devices are implantable sensors; the majority are conventional CGMs. The GlobalData pipeline products database indicates that 133 goods are either approved or in the development stage. According to the data, this market niche is growing rapidly and is a center for cutting-edge new technologies such as implantable CGMs. AI is now being included in CGM technology. For instance, Roche unveiled Accu-Chek SmartGuide, a revolutionary predictive AI-powered CGM device. Roche Diabetes Care Chief Medical Officer Julien Boisdron described it as \u201ca solution more than a CGM\u201d at the introduction. He explained how the system, which includes a sensor and two algorithms, helps with prediction and data visualization. Rising Demand for GLP-1 Medications: Opportunities and Challenges in Diabetes and Obesity Treatment The management of diabetes and its related complications has entered a new era of opportunity. The combined issues of diabetes and obesity can be effectively treated with these innovative approaches. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists are a class of medications used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. The GLP-1 market, which is driven equally by diabetes and obesity, is predicted to reach $100 billion by 2030. By this time, there could be 30 million GLP-1 users or around 9% of the US population. Story Continues According to the most recent KFF Health Tracking survey, 12% of adult Americans say they have used a GLP-1 medication at some point. In the past five years, 43% of GLP-1 prescription users had diabetes, and 22% of patients with obesity or overweight diagnoses also took the medication. Over the course of the past year, the percentage of adults who have heard \"a little\" or \"a lot\" about these medicines has climbed from 70% to 82%, while the percentage of adults who have heard \"a lot\" or \"a lot\" about them has increased from 19% to 32%. However, the rising demand for these weight-loss and diabetes drugs has created challenges. The National Pharmacy Association (NPA) warned of a possible \"explosion in the unlicensed sale of medication online.\" Semaglutides, marketed under the name Ozempic, assist people with type 2 diabetes in controlling their blood sugar levels. However, they are also frequently used to aid in weight loss in certain nations, such as the US, where they are marketed under the name Wegovy. NPA chairman Nick Kaye stated: \u201cPharmacists remain deeply concerned that the current medicine shortages crisis could lead to an explosion in the unlicensed sale of medication online.\u201d Our Methodology Our methodology involved identifying healthcare companies focused on diabetes treatment using a stock screener.

New in vivo preclinical data announced today, demonstrate that icovamenib, in combination with semaglutide showed additional 11.5% body weight reduction and 43% increase in lean muscle mass compared to semaglutide alone Icovamenib, in combination with semaglutide, approximately doubled C-peptide production per unit of glucose compared to semaglutide alone leading to a 60% improved reduction of fasting blood glucose Ex vivo human islet experiments previously presented in October, showed that icovamenib enhanced the activity of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-based therapies, leading to substantial increase in insulin secretion Topline data from the COVALENT-111 study showed that 12 weeks of daily icovamenib in patients uncontrolled on a GLP-1-based therapy (n=10) led to an HbA1c reduction of 0.84% at week 26 Further data will be presented during the upcoming J.P. Morgan Conference January 13-15, 2025 REDWOOD CITY, Calif., Jan. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biomea Fusion, Inc. (\u201cBiomea\u201d or \u201cBiomea Fusion\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d) (Nasdaq: BMEA), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering and developing oral covalent small molecules to improve the lives of patients with diabetes, obesity, and genetically defined cancers, today announce compelling results from in vivo studies of icovamenib in combination with semaglutide. About the study: This preclinical study evaluated the efficacy of icovamenib, an investigational covalent menin inhibitor, in combination with a GLP-1 receptor agonist (i.e., semaglutide) to assess key metabolic parameters in animal models including: improvements in C-peptide index, a marker of insulin secretion and glucose regulation, blood glucose, HbA1c, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and beta cell function (HOMA-B), changes in body weight and composition, including fat and lean mass, and appetite suppression. Biomarkers were analyzed at multiple time points throughout a 28-day period. The study was conducted in two groups, one group of 10 Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats dosed with icovamenib (day 1 through day 28) in combination with semaglutide (day 14 through day 28) and a second group of 10 ZDF rats dosed with semaglutide alone (day 14 through day 28). ZDF rat is a type 2 diabetes animal model of insulin resistance. Highlights of the Study: Superior Glycemic Control: A 60% reduction in fasting blood glucose level was observed with combination therapy compared to semaglutide alone. A 50% reduction in area under the curve (AUC) was observed during the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) with combination therapy versus semaglutide alone, indicating improved glucose metabolism (p<0.0001). Lire la suite Improvements in HbA1c: HbA1c reduction on Day 28 was greater with the combination therapy (>1%) compared to semaglutide alone (p<0.05). Reduced Insulin Resistance and Improvements in Beta Cell Function: Insulin resistance as measured by HOMA-IR was reduced by 75% with combination therapy compared to semaglutide alone (p<0.001). Combination treatment also improved beta-cell function as measured by HOMA-B. Weight Loss and Muscle Mass Improvements: Combination therapy reduced body weight by 11.5% and fat mass by 29.5% compared to semaglutide alone. A 43% increase in lean mass compared to semaglutide alone was also observed with combination therapy. We believe these results underscore the combination's unique ability to reduce fat mass while preserving and enhancing lean muscle mass. Validated Safety Icovamenib in combination with semaglutide was well tolerated across multiple time points. \u201cWe believe these preclinical results underscore the potential of icovamenib to transform diabetes treatment when combined with GLP-1-based therapies,\u201d said Juan Pablo Frias, Biomea Fusion\u2019s Chief Medical Officer. \u201cOur studies demonstrated that icovamenib not only increased the C-peptide index but also amplified key benefits of GLP-1 therapies, including improved glycemic and body weight control. Importantly, this synergy may enable lower doses of GLP-1 therapies to achieve glycemic and weight loss targets, potentially reducing side effects and improving tolerability. We are very encouraged by these preclinical results and look forward to further assessing this combination in clinical trials to potentially address unmet needs of people living with type 2 diabetes.\u201d About Menin\u2019s Role in Diabetes Loss of functional beta cell mass is a core component of the natural history in both types of diabetes \u2014 type 1 diabetes (T1D) (mediated by autoimmune dysfunction) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) (mediated by metabolic dysfunction). Beta cells are found in the pancreas and are responsible for the synthesis and secretion of insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy and helps control blood glucose levels. In patients with diabetes, beta cell mass and function have been observed to be diminished, leading to insufficient insulin secretion and hyperglycemia. Menin is thought to act as a brake on beta cell turnover and growth, supporting the notion that inhibition of menin could lead to the regeneration of normal, healthy beta cells. Based on these and other scientific findings, Biomea is exploring the potential for icovamenib-mediated menin inhibition as a viable therapeutic approach to potentially halt or reverse progression of T2D. About Type 2 Diabetes Diabetes is considered a chronic health condition that affects how the body turns food into energy and results in excessive glucose in the bloodstream. Over time, this can cause serious health problems and damage vital organs. Most people with diabetes have a shorter life expectancy than people without this disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about two in five adults in the United States are now expected to develop diabetes during their lifetime. More than 37 million people of all ages (about 11% of the United States population) have diabetes today. 96 million adults (more than one in three) have pre-diabetes, blood glucose levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. Diabetes is also one of the largest economic burdens on the United States health care system with one dollar out of every four dollars in United States health care costs spent on caring for people with diabetes. Despite the current availability of many diabetes medications, there remains a significant need in the treatment and care of patients with diabetes. About Icovamenib Icovamenib is an investigational, orally bioavailable, potent, and selective covalent inhibitor of menin. The molecule was built using Biomea Fusion\u2019s FUSION\u2122 System and is designed to regenerate insulin-producing beta cells with the aim to cure diabetes. Icovamenib\u2019s proposed mechanism of action in diabetes is to enable the proliferation, preservation, and reactivation of a patient\u2019s own healthy, functional, insulin-producing beta cells. As the potentially first disease-modifying therapy for T1D and T2D, icovamenib could become an important addition and complement to the diabetes treatment landscape once it has successfully completed its ongoing clinical studies. About Biomea Fusion Biomea Fusion is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of oral covalent small molecules to improve the lives of patients with diabetes, obesity, and genetically defined cancers. A covalent small molecule is a synthetic compound that forms a permanent bond to its target protein and offers a number of potential advantages over conventional non-covalent drugs, including greater target selectivity, lower drug exposure, and the ability to drive a deeper, more durable response.

Vandana Singh Tue, Dec 17, 2024, 6:41 PM 2 min read In This Article: BMEA -5.98% Why Is Diabetes-Drug Developer Biomea Fusion Stock Trading Lower On Tuesday? On Tuesday, Biomea Fusion Inc. (NASDAQ: BMEA ) revealed topline results from the ongoing COVALENT-111 study of icovamenib in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) . Icovamenib was investigated in three different dosing arms with a primary follow-up after 26 weeks: Arm A at 100mg QD (once daily) for 8 weeks, Arm B at 100mg QD for 12 weeks, and Arm C at 100 mg QD for 8 weeks and 100mg BID (twice daily) for 4 weeks. Also Read: FDA Removes Clinical Hold On Biomea Fusion\u2019s Early-Stage Trials For Potential Diabetes Candidate The study showed positive topline results at Week 26, demonstrating statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c, the gold standard for assessing glycemic control in T2D. Patients who completed dosing per the protocol and were suboptimally controlled at baseline on one or more prior agents, icovamenib, showed meaningful reductions in HbA1c with statistical significance in all major categories. Here, icovamenib showed a mean reduction in HbA1c of 0.36% (p=0.022). Arm B (icovamenib dosed at 100mg QD for 12 weeks) was the strongest performing arm with a mean HbA1c reduction of 0.5% (p=0.012). In the analysis of the T2D phenotypes, icovamenib showed further improved reduction in insulin-deficient patients. Within the mild age-related diabetes (MARD) and severe insulin-deficient diabetes (SIDD) patients, the mean HbA1c reduction was 0.73%, and in Arm B, these patient subtypes reduced the mean HbA1c by 1.05%. The patients who were considered most severely insulin deficient, the SIDDs, demonstrated the best response with a mean HbA1c reduction in Arm B of 1.47%. Of note, in the patients who failed on a GLP-1-based therapy, an HbA1c reduction of 0.84% was demonstrated. No serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events were observed. No drug-to-drug interactions were observed during the study. Overall, icovamenib was well tolerated and demonstrated a favorable safety profile in the COVALENT-111 study.

Covalent FLT3 Inhibitor, in Relapsed or Refractory Acute Leukemia Biomea Fusion, Inc. Fri, Dec 6, 2024, 4:00 PM 6 min read In This Article: BMEA -5.98% Biomea Fusion, Inc. REDWOOD CITY, Calif., Dec. 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biomea Fusion, Inc. (\u201cBiomea\u201d) (Nasdaq: BMEA), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering and developing oral covalent small molecules to treat and improve the lives of patients with diabetes, obesity, and genetically defined cancers, today announced that it will host a conference call and webcast on Monday, December 9, 2024 at 4:30 pm EST to present data from COVALENT-103, the company\u2019s Phase I trial of BMF-500, an investigational covalent FLT3 inhibitor developed using the proprietary FUSION\u2122\u00a0System, in adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia. Conference Call and Webcast Details Webcast of Biomea\u2019s investor update on Monday, December 9, 2024 at 4:30 pm EST will be available to registered attendees under the Investors and Media section of the company\u2019s website at https://investors.biomeafusion.com/news-events/events . A replay of the presentation will be archived on Biomea\u2019s site following the event. About COVALENT-103 COVALENT-103 is a multicenter, open-label, non-randomized trial seeking to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BMF-500, a twice daily oral treatment, in adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia with FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) wild-type and FLT3 mutations. Additional information about the Phase I clinical trial of BMF-500 can be found at ClinicalTrials.gov using the identifier, NCT05918692. About BMF-500 BMF-500, an investigational, novel, orally bioavailable, highly potent and selective covalent small molecule inhibitor of FLT3, was discovered and developed in-house at Biomea using the company\u2019s proprietary FUSION\u2122 System and has demonstrated encouraging potential based on extensive preclinical studies. The kinase inhibitory profile of BMF-500 showed high target selectivity, suggesting the potential for reduced off-target liabilities. BMF-500 was designed to have a therapeutic profile to allow for combinations with standard of care and/or novel targeted agents like icovamenib, Biomea\u2019s investigational covalent menin inhibitor currently in clinical development for solid and liquid tumors as well as diabetes. Previous data presented at the 2022 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting showed BMF-500\u2019s picomolar affinity for inhibition of activating FLT3 mutations, including FLT3-ITD and various tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations. BMF-500 demonstrated multi-fold higher potency and increased cytotoxicity than the commercially available non-covalent FLT3 inhibitor gilteritinib. These data also showed complete tumor regression in mouse models of FLT3-ITD acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with no tumor regrowth even after treatment cessation. Story Continues Data presented at the 2023 American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting exhibited the potential utility of combination strategies to achieve higher antileukemic cell killing with reduced concentrations of BMF-500 and icovamenib. Additionally, Biomea has shown the potential of combinatorial approaches of BMF-500 and icovamenib with MEK and BCL2 blockade in other preclinical studies. These data provide preclinical evidence for combining pathway-specific inhibitors as a promising therapeutic strategy for further investigation in acute leukemia. About FLT3 in AML FLT3 is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that plays a central role in the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of immature blood cells. FLT3 gene mutations are common in patients with AML and are associated with a poor prognosis. Nearly 30% of AML patients have a FLT3 mutation, representing more than 7,000 incident patients in the U.S. each year. In addition, academic literature suggests that more than 50% of AML patients with an NPM1 mutation also harbor a FLT3 mutation. While FLT3-specific and pan-tyrosine kinase inhibitors are approved by the FDA across various lines of therapy in AML, these agents have produced relatively low rates of durable responses and overall survival remains an unmet need. About Biomea Fusion Biomea Fusion is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of oral covalent small molecules to improve the lives of patients with diabetes, obesity, and genetically defined cancers. A covalent small molecule is a synthetic compound that forms a permanent bond to its target protein and offers a number of potential advantages over conventional non-covalent drugs, including greater target selectivity, lower drug exposure, and the ability to drive a deeper, more durable response. We are utilizing our proprietary FUSION\u2122 System to discover, design, and develop a pipeline of next-generation covalent-binding small-molecule medicines designed to maximize clinical benefit for patients. We aim to have an outsized impact on the treatment of disease for the patients we serve. We aim to cure. Visit us at biomeafusion.com and follow us on LinkedIn , X , and Facebook .

Topline Results from Ongoing Phase II COVALENT-111 Study in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Biomea Fusion, Inc. Tue, Dec 17, 2024, 4:10 PM 11 min read In This Article: BMEA -5.98% Biomea Fusion, Inc. Icovamenib met the primary endpoint, displaying a meaningful statistically significant placebo-corrected mean reduction in HbA1c in the prespecified per protocol patient population Best response achieved in target, beta-cell deficient patients on one or more antidiabetic agents at baseline, showing a placebo-adjusted mean reduction of 1.47% in HbA1c at Week 26 with statistical significance, after only 12 weeks of dosing icovamenib with 100 mg Icovamenib was well-tolerated, with no adverse-event related discontinuations, no hypoglycemic events and no serious adverse events REDWOOD CITY, Calif., Dec. 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biomea Fusion, Inc. (\u201cBiomea\u201d or \u201cBiomea Fusion\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d) (Nasdaq: BMEA), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering and developing oral covalent small molecules to improve the lives of patients with diabetes, obesity, and genetically defined cancers, today announced positive topline results from the ongoing COVALENT-111 study, evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of icovamenib in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). COVALENT-111 is a double-blinded, randomized, 3:1 placebo-controlled trial that has enrolled adult patients diagnosed with T2D within the last 7 years, who had HbA1c levels between 7.0% and 10.5%, and a body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 40 kg/m\u00b2. At baseline, all participants were receiving treatment with diet and exercise and were uncontrolled with up to three antidiabetic medications. Icovamenib was investigated in three different dosing arms with a primary follow up after 26 weeks which we are reporting on today: Arm A at 100mg QD (once daily) for 8 weeks, Arm B at 100mg QD for 12 weeks, and Arm C at 100 mg QD for 8 weeks and 100mg BID (twice daily) for 4 weeks. The study enrolled a total of 225 patients that received at least one dose of icovamenib and were considered evaluable for the modified intent-to-treat population (mITT). Dosing was interrupted for many patients due to an interim clinical hold imposed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This topline efficacy analysis focuses on those patients who had completed at least 80% of their dosing prior to the clinical hold and who at baseline were treated with one or more anti-hyperglycemic therapy, the Per Protocol Patient population (n=168). The study showed positive topline results at Week 26, demonstrating statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c, the gold standard for assessing glycemic control in T2D. In patients who completed dosing per protocol and were suboptimally controlled at baseline on one or more prior agent, icovamenib showed meaningful reductions in HbA1c with statistical significance in all major categories. Here icovamenib showed a mean reduction in HbA1c of 0.36% (p=0.022). The strongest performing arm was Arm B (icovamenib dosed at 100mg QD for 12 weeks) with a mean HbA1c reduction of 0.5% (p=0.012). In the analysis of the T2D phenotypes, icovamenib showed further improved reduction in the insulin deficient patients. Within the mild age-related diabetes (MARD) and severe insulin-deficient diabetes (SIDD) patients the mean HbA1c reduction was 0.73% (p=0.009) and in Arm B these patient subtypes reduced the mean HbA1c by 1.05% (p=0.004). Patients who were considered most severe insulin deficient, the SIDDs, demonstrated the best response with a mean HbA1c reduction in Arm B of 1.47% (p=0.022). Importantly, MARD and SIDD represent more than 50% of the US patient population. Of note, in the patients that failed on a GLP-1 based therapy an HbA1c reduction of 0.84% was demonstrated. Story Continues Throughout the 26-week period there were no serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events observed. No drug-to-drug interactions were observed during the study. Overall, icovamenib was well tolerated and demonstrated a favorable safety profile in the COVALENT-111 study. The company used clinical biomarker data to categorize participants into prespecified subtypes (SIDD, MARD, SIRD, and MOD) during screening: SIDD : Characterized by low insulin secretion, high HbA1c, and reduced beta-cell function (low HOMA-B) MARD : Characterized by mild age-related diabetes, typically older age at onset, with mild hyperglycemia and fewer metabolic disturbances SIRD : Defined by significant insulin resistance, high HOMA-IR, and potential complications like liver disease MOD : Identified by mild obesity, less severe insulin resistance, and relatively mild hyperglycemia The study will further assess secondary endpoints (e.g., HbA1c reduction, fasting glucose, HOMA-B and HOMA-IR) within each pre-specified subtype to identify distinct patterns of response. Analysis of the full Phase II COVALENT-111 data is ongoing and Biomea Fusion plans to present detailed results at an upcoming medical conference in 2025. \"I am very excited about these initial results we are presenting today. We believe we now have a defined path to further develop icovamenib in diabetes. We have identified the optimal dose, the patient population to target, and most importantly, we now have strong efficacy and safety data,\" says Thomas Butler, CEO and Chair of Biomea Fusion. \"These results validate our approach and highlight that icovamenib has the potential to address an aspect of diabetes that no other current therapy can. We are excited to continue advancing this promising molecule and bring a new treatment option to patients who need it most.\" Based on these initial results and the upcoming 52-week readout in the second half 2025, Biomea plans to engage with the FDA to discuss the data. This meeting will provide an opportunity to align with FDA on how to further advance icovamenib as a first-in-class menin inhibitor therapy for T2D. \"The topline data from the COVALENT-111 Phase II study are incredibly promising, showing that icovamenib delivers significant and clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c. We now understand the duration of dosing and target patient population. This study confirms the potential of menin inhibition as a novel mechanism for treating type 2 diabetes. Achieving a HbA1c reduction of this magnitude without chronic treatment is paradigm shifting in diabetes therapy,\u201d said Dr. Juan Pablo Frias, Chief Medical Officer of Biomea Fusion. Conference Call and Webcast Details Webcast of Biomea\u2019s investor update on Tuesday, December 17, 2024, at 8:00 am EST will be available to registered attendees under the Investors and Media section of the company\u2019s website at https://investors.biomeafusion.com/news-events/events . A replay of the presentation will be archived on Biomea\u2019s site following the event. The clinical hold which was placed on icovamenib was due to data FDA had observed during the Escalation Phase, when higher dosages of icovamenib were tested. The clinical hold led to a disruption for patients enrolled in the COVALENT-111 study. It had a more profound impact on the ongoing Phase II COVALENT -112 study in type 1 diabetes, where over 90% of the targeted patient population were not able to complete dosing due to the clinical hold. We are therefore planning to continue the enrollment in COVALENT-112 so we can provide a more complete update in this patient population in 2025. About Icovamenib Icovamenib is an investigational, orally bioavailable, potent, and selective covalent inhibitor of menin. The molecule was built using Biomea Fusion\u2019s FUSION\u2122 System and is designed to regenerate insulin-producing beta cells with the aim to cure diabetes. Icovamenib\u2019s proposed mechanism of action in diabetes is to enable the proliferation, preservation, and reactivation of a patient\u2019s own healthy, functional, insulin-producing beta cells. As the potentially first disease-modifying therapy for T1D and T2D, icovamenib could become an important addition and complement to the diabetes treatment landscape once it has successfully completed its ongoing clinical studies. About Menin\u2019s Role in Diabetes Loss of functional beta cell mass is a core component of the natural history in both types of diabetes \u2014 type 1 diabetes (mediated by autoimmune dysfunction) and T2D (mediated by metabolic dysfunction). Beta cells are found in the pancreas and are responsible for the synthesis and secretion of insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy and helps control blood glucose levels. In patients with diabetes, beta cell mass and function have been observed to be diminished, leading to insufficient insulin secretion and hyperglycemia. Menin is thought to act as a brake on beta cell turnover and growth, supporting the notion that inhibition of menin could lead to the regeneration of normal, healthy beta cells. Based on these and other scientific findings, Biomea is exploring the potential for icovamenib-mediated menin inhibition as a viable therapeutic approach to potentially halt or reverse progression of T2D. About Type 2 Diabetes Diabetes is considered a chronic health condition that affects how the body turns food into energy and results in excessive glucose in the bloodstream. Over time, this can cause serious health problems and damage vital organs. Most people with diabetes have a shorter life expectancy than people without this disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about two in five adults in the United States are now expected to develop diabetes during their lifetime. More than 37 million people of all ages (about 11% of the US population) have diabetes today. 96 million adults (more than one in three) have pre-diabetes, blood glucose levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. Diabetes is also one of the largest economic burdens on the United States health care system with one dollar out of every four dollars in US health care costs spent on caring for people with diabetes. Despite the current availability of many diabetes medications, there remains a significant need in the treatment and care of patients with diabetes. About Biomea Fusion Biomea Fusion is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of oral covalent small molecules to improve the lives of patients with diabetes, obesity, and genetically defined cancers. A covalent small molecule is a synthetic compound that forms a permanent bond to its target protein and offers a number of potential advantages over conventional non-covalent drugs, including greater target selectivity, lower drug exposure, and the ability to drive a deeper, more durable response. We are utilizing our proprietary FUSION\u2122 System to discover, design and develop a pipeline of next-generation covalent-binding small-molecule medicines designed to maximize clinical benefit for patients.

In preclinical experiments, icovamenib enhanced beta cell function and responsiveness of human islets to GLP-1-based therapies. These effects were associated with an increase in the expression levels of both the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) as well as intracellular insulin. Overall results showed synergy of the combination therapy, which may allow lower doses of GLP-1-based therapies to achieve glycemic targets, potentially reducing side effects and improving tolerability of GLP-1 based therapies. REDWOOD CITY, Calif., Dec. 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biomea Fusion, Inc. (\u201cBiomea\u201d or \u201cBiomea Fusion\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d) (Nasdaq: BMEA), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering and developing oral covalent small molecules to improve the lives of patients with diabetes, obesity, and genetically defined cancers, today announced the Company will present one oral presentation, one poster presentation, and host an oral symposium at the 22nd World Congress on Insulin Resistance, Diabetes & Cardiovascular Disease (WCIRDC) taking place in Los Angeles, California on December 12-14, 2024. \u201cThe data we will present during the WCIRDC this year show that there may be complementary mechanisms of action between icovamenib and approved GLP-1-based therapies that have the potential to provide a synergistic response and improved efficacy for patients. We observed in preclinical experiments that icovamenib not only increased beta cell mass but also enhanced the responsiveness to the GLP-1-based therapies. These complementary effects may ultimately have the potential to increase the effectiveness of current GLP-1 based agents,\u201d said Juan Pablo Frias, Biomea Fusion\u2019s Chief Medical Officer. \u201cThe increase in beta cell mass from icovamenib may also potentially allow for lower doses of approved GLP-1-based therapies to achieve glycemic targets, potentially reducing side effects and improving tolerability of these agents. Icovamenib also has a proposed mechanism of action that has been shown to be complementary to metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors, two very commonly used agents in type 2 diabetes (T2D). We look forward to further exploring clinically the potential benefits icovamenib may provide to persons with diabetes.\u201d Oral Presentation Abstract #0069 Combination of Icovamenib and GLP-1-Based Therapeutic Agents Improves Beta Cell Function and Insulin Secretion Presentation Time Oral Presentation: December 13th, 2024, at 7:30pm \u2013 9:00pm PST Poster Presentation Abstract #0063 Investigating the Effects of Icovamenib on Poorly Managed Severe Insulin-Deficient Diabetes (SIDD): Insights from COVALENT-111 Case Studies Presentation Time Poster Presentation: December 12, 2024, at 6:30pm \u2013 7:30pm PST Story Continues Breakfast Symposium Unlocking the Potential of Menin Inhibition: Icovamenib and a look into the Future of Diabetes Management Presentation Time December 13, 2024, at 7:00am \u2013 7:45am PST Please find a link here to our website where the poster and presentations will be available. Data Highlights for Presentations at WCIRDC Icovamenib is an investigational covalent menin inhibitor in development to address the root cause of diabetes: the progressive decline in beta cell mass and function. The data published at the WCIRDC annual meeting showed a selective proliferation of beta cells and an increase in the expression levels of both GLP-1 receptors and intracellular insulin in human islets treated ex-vivo with icovamenib, effects reproducible in multiple donors. Menin has been shown to regulate GLP-1R expression and, consequently, the GLP-1R pathway. Effects on GLP-1R and insulin gene expression were evaluated in islet cultures from 8 independent healthy donors. Icovamenib enhanced the responsiveness of human islets to the GLP-1-based therapies, semaglutide and tirzepatide and induced enhancement in beta cell function correlated with an increase in the expression levels of both the GLP-1R as well as intracellular insulin. Both transcript and protein levels were increased. In these experiments, icovamenib promoted controlled proliferation and enhanced insulin content in beta cells in human islet microtissues ex vivo, in a glucose- and dose- dependent manner. The overall results showed synergy of the combination therapy utilizing icovamenib together with a GLP-1 based therapy. We believe the increase in beta cell mass and improved beta cell function induced by icovamenib may allow lower doses of GLP-1-based therapies to achieve glycemic targets, potentially reducing side effects and improving tolerability of these agents. In addition, data from earlier presentations were published at the 22 nd WCIRDC, showing how covalently inhibiting menin may be particularly relevant for diabetes patients with a depleted pool of beta cells. Whereby the severe insulin-deficient diabetes (SIDD) and mild age-related diabetes (MARD) subgroups in relevant dose escalation cohorts reviewed, showed approximately a 2.5-fold improvement in HbA1c reduction versus the insulin resistant diabetes (SIRD) and the mild obesity related diabetes (MOD) subgroups. T2D subtyping reveals distinct risk profiles and provides a framework for precision medicine. In addition, data presented from clinical case studies showed the potential of short-term icovamenib treatment to modify disease progression and provide lasting effects in patients with uncontrolled T2D. In these case studies icovamenib was generally well tolerated, there were no treatment related adverse events, no dose discontinuations or modifications reported, and no symptomatic or clinically significant hypoglycemia was observed. About Menin\u2019s Role in Diabetes Loss of functional beta cell mass is a core component of the natural history in both types of diabetes \u2014 type 1 diabetes (mediated by autoimmune dysfunction) and T2D (mediated by metabolic dysfunction). Beta cells are found in the pancreas and are responsible for the synthesis and secretion of insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy and helps control blood glucose levels. In patients with diabetes, beta cell mass and function have been observed to be diminished, leading to insufficient insulin secretion and hyperglycemia. Menin is thought to act as a brake on beta cell turnover and growth, supporting the notion that inhibition of menin could lead to the regeneration of normal, healthy beta cells. Based on these and other scientific findings, Biomea is exploring the potential for icovamenib-mediated menin inhibition as a viable therapeutic approach to potentially halt or reverse progression of T2D. About Type 2 Diabetes Diabetes is considered a chronic health condition that affects how the body turns food into energy and results in excessive glucose in the bloodstream. Over time, this can cause serious health problems and damage vital organs. Most people with diabetes have a shorter life expectancy than people without this disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about two in five adults in the United States are now expected to develop diabetes during their lifetime. More than 37 million people of all ages (about 11% of the US population) have diabetes today. 96 million adults (more than one in three) have pre-diabetes, blood glucose levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. Diabetes is also one of the largest economic burdens on the United States health care system with one dollar out of every four dollars in US health care costs spent on caring for people with diabetes. Despite the current availability of many diabetes medications, there remains a significant need in the treatment and care of patients with diabetes. About Icovamenib Icovamenib is an investigational, orally bioavailable, potent, and selective covalent inhibitor of menin. The molecule was built using Biomea Fusion\u2019s FUSION\u2122 System and is designed to regenerate insulin-producing beta cells with the aim to cure diabetes. Icovamenib\u2019s proposed mechanism of action in diabetes is to enable the proliferation, preservation, and reactivation of a patient\u2019s own healthy, functional, insulin-producing beta cells. As the potentially first disease-modifying therapy for T1D and T2D, icovamenib could become an important addition and complement to the diabetes treatment landscape once it has successfully completed its ongoing clinical studies.
