[{"text": "Institutional investors own a significant stake of 49% in Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:AQST) editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 1:48 PM 4 min read In This Article: AQST -4.30% Key Insights Significantly high institutional ownership implies Aquestive Therapeutics' stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 21 shareholders own 50% of the company Recent sales by insiders To get a sense of who is truly in control of Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. ( NASDAQ:AQST ), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 49% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Aquestive Therapeutics. See our latest analysis for Aquestive Therapeutics NasdaqGM:AQST Ownership Breakdown January 27th 2025 What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Aquestive Therapeutics? Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Aquestive Therapeutics. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Aquestive Therapeutics, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. NasdaqGM:AQST Earnings and Revenue Growth January 27th 2025 Aquestive Therapeutics is not owned by hedge funds. Bratton Capital Management, L.P. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.4% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.1% by the third-largest shareholder. Furthermore, CEO Daniel Barber is the owner of 1.5% of the company's shares. A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 21 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily. Story Continues Insider Ownership Of Aquestive Therapeutics The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. We can report that insiders do own shares in Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc.. As individuals, the insiders collectively own US$14m worth of the US$282m company. It is good to see some investment by insiders, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public Ownership The general public-- including retail investors -- own 40% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. Private Equity Ownership With a stake of 6.1%, private equity firms could influence the Aquestive Therapeutics board. Some might like this, because private equity are sometimes activists who hold management accountable. But other times, private equity is selling out, having taking the company public. Next Steps: I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

On track to submit Anaphylm\u2122 (epinephrine) Sublingual Film NDA in Q1 2025 Actively recruiting subjects in the Anaphylm pediatric clinical trial Successfully completed AQST-108 (epinephrine) Topical Gel pre-IND meeting and on track to begin Phase 2a clinical trial in alopecia areata in Q2 2025 Unaudited cash and cash equivalents of approximately $70 million as of December 31, 2024 WARREN, N.J., Jan. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: AQST) (\u201cAquestive\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a pharmaceutical company advancing medicines to bring meaningful improvement to patients' lives through innovative science and delivery technologies, today provided an update on recent business developments and outlined key objectives for 2025. \u201cIn 2024, we significantly advanced the Company and delivered on our key milestones. Our achievements last year have positioned the Company for continued success in 2025,\u201d said Dan Barber, President and Chief Executive Officer of Aquestive. \u201cWe believe our long-term growth strategy remains compelling with the potential approval and launches of Anaphylm, Libervant (patients 6+), and AQST-108 in the U.S. and around the world. Our focus in 2025 is on 1) preparing for the potential approval and launch of Anaphylm for the treatment of severe allergies, including anaphylaxis, in the U.S. as early as the first quarter of 2026, 2) actively pursuing our ex-U.S. development strategy for Anaphylm, 3) successfully conducting our Phase 2a clinical trial in alopecia areata for AQST-108, 4) continuing to expand our sales of Libervant\u00ae (diazepam) Buccal Film for patients between two to five years of age, and (5) continuing to shift our current revenue base from legacy products to Libervant and other growth opportunities. This is truly an exciting time at Aquestive.\u201d Anaphylm\u2122 (epinephrine) Sublingual Film In 2024, Aquestive made significant progress with Anaphylm, its innovative epinephrine delivery system. The Company concluded a successful pre-New Drug Application (NDA) meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which provided clear guidance on the regulatory pathway to NDA submission for Anaphylm. Additionally, Aquestive initiated a Phase 1 pediatric trial of Anaphylm in children aged 7 to 17 years and \u226530 kg, further demonstrating its commitment to expanding access to this treatment across age groups. Aquestive is on track to submit the NDA for Anaphylm in the first quarter of 2025, with the goal of addressing critical unmet needs in severe allergy management. The anticipated NDA submission marks a pivotal step toward bringing this innovative treatment to market, underscoring Aquestive\u2019s commitment to providing to patients the first and only orally delivered epinephrine product for the treatment of severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, if approved by the FDA. Story Continues AQST-108 (epinephrine) Topical Gel Aquestive successfully completed a pre-Investigational New Drug meeting with the FDA in December 2024. The written response received from the FDA was supportive of continued development and Aquestive remains on track to begin its Phase 2a trial in patients with alopecia areata (AA) in the second quarter of 2025. An estimated 6.7 million people in the United States have been affected by AA. Of those affected, 43% are considered severe. The existing therapies for alopecia areata are janus kinase (or JAK) inhibitors. These systemic treatments with known side effects come with a \"black box\" warning and are expensive for patients. Even with these limitations, the current estimated market opportunity for JAK inhibitors is over one billion U.S. dollars. In the first in human Phase 1 clinical trial, AQST-108 demonstrated no serious adverse events or topical adverse events. Since AQST-108 is topical and there is evidence that it acts at the application site, it may not have systemic side effects. As a result of these conditions, AQST-108, if approved by the FDA as a treatment for severe alopecia areata, has the potential to capture meaningful market share for the treatment of these patients. Libervant \u00ae (diazepam) Buccal Film Aquestive received FDA approval for Libervant in 2024, enabling access for the treatment of seizure clusters in pediatric patients with epilepsy between two to five years of age. This milestone ensures younger patients in this age group have access to this essential treatment. In December 2024, the Company received Orphan Drug Exclusivity for Libervant for patients between two to five years of age until April 2031. Libervant is the first and only FDA approved orally administered rescue product for the treatment of seizure clusters in patients with epilepsy between two to five years of age. About Anaphylm\u2122 (epinephrine) Sublingual Film Anaphylm\u2122 (epinephrine) Sublingual Film is a polymer matrix-based epinephrine prodrug product candidate. Anaphylm is similar in size to a postage stamp, weighs less than an ounce, and begins to dissolve on contact. No water or swallowing is required for administration. The packaging for Anaphylm is thinner and smaller than an average credit card, can be carried in a pocket, and is designed to withstand weather excursions such as exposure to rain and/or sunlight. The Anaphylm trade name for AQST-109 has been conditionally approved by the FDA. Final approval of the Anaphylm proprietary name is conditioned on FDA approval of the product candidate. About AQST-108 (epinephrine) Topical Gel AQST-108 is a topically delivered adrenergic agonist prodrug gel product candidate. Aquestive completed a first in human study for AQST-108 that measured the amount of epinephrine that remained on the skin or was found in circulation over time after the application of the gel and without any serious or topical adverse events. AQST-108 is based on Aquestive's Adrenaverse\u2122 platform that contains a library of over twenty epinephrine prodrug product candidates intended to control absorption and conversion rates across a variety of possible dosage forms and delivery sites. About Libervant \u00ae (diazepam) Buccal Film Libervant is a buccally, or inside of the cheek, administered film formulation of diazepam, a benzodiazepine intended for the acute treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity ( i.e ., seizure clusters, acute repetitive seizures) that are distinct from a patient\u2019s usual seizure pattern in patients with epilepsy between two to five years of age. Aquestive developed Libervant as an alternative to the device-based products currently available for patients with refractory epilepsy, including rectal gel and nasal spray products. The FDA granted tentative approval of Libervant in August 2022 for the treatment of these epilepsy patients 12 years of age and older, with U.S. market access for Libervant for this age group of patients subject to the expiration of the existing orphan drug market exclusivity of a previously FDA approved drug scheduled to expire in January 2027. The Company plans to submit an NDA and launch Libervant for these epilepsy patients between 6 to 11 years of age, if approved by the FDA, upon the expiration of the existing orphan drug market exclusivity scheduled to expire in January 2027. The FDA approval for U.S. market access received in April 2024 for Libervant is for these epilepsy patients between two to five years of age. Important Safety Information Important Safety Information Do not give Libervant \u00ae to your child if your child is allergic to diazepam or any of the ingredients in Libervant or has an eye problem called acute narrow angle glaucoma. What is the most important information I should know about Libervant? Libervant is a benzodiazepine medicine. Taking benzodiazepines with opioid medicines, alcohol, or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (including street drugs) can cause severe drowsiness, breathing problems (respiratory depression), coma, and death. Get emergency help right away if any of the following happens: shallow or slowed breathing, breathing stops (which may lead to the heart stopping), excessive sleepiness (sedation). Do not allow your child to drive a motor vehicle, operate heavy machinery, or ride a bicycle until you know how taking Libervant with opioids affects your child. Risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Libervant is used in children 2 to 5 years of age. The unapproved use of Libervant has a risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose and serious side effects including coma and death. Serious side effects including coma and death have happened in people who have abused or misused benzodiazepines, including diazepam (the active ingredient in Libervant). These serious side effects may also include delirium, paranoia, suicidal thoughts or actions, seizures, and difficulty breathing. Call your child\u2019s healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you get any of these serious side effects. Your child can develop an addiction even if your child takes Libervant as prescribed by your child\u2019s healthcare provider. Give Libervant exactly as your child\u2019s healthcare provider prescribed. Do not share Libervant with other people. Keep Libervant in a safe place and away from children. Physical dependence and withdrawal reactions. Libervant is intended for use if needed in order to treat higher than usual seizure activity. Benzodiazepines, including Libervant, can cause physical dependence and withdrawal reactions, especially if used daily. Libervant is not intended for daily use. Do not suddenly stop giving Libervant to your child without talking to your child\u2019s healthcare provider. Stopping Libervant suddenly can cause serious and life-threatening side effects, including, unusual movements, responses, or expressions, seizures that will not stop (status epilepticus), sudden and severe mental or nervous system changes, depression, seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear, homicidal thoughts, an extreme increase in activity or talking, losing touch with reality, and suicidal thoughts or actions. Call your child\u2019s healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if your child gets any of these symptoms. Some people who suddenly stop benzodiazepines have symptoms that can last for several weeks to more than 12 months including, anxiety, trouble remembering, learning, or concentrating, depression, problems sleeping, feeling like insects are crawling under your skin, weakness, shaking, muscle twitching, burning, or prickling feeling in your hands, arms, legs or feet, and ringing in your ears. Physical dependence is not the same as drug addiction. Your child\u2019s healthcare provider can tell you more about the differences between physical dependence and drug addiction. Do not give your child more Libervant than prescribed or give Libervant more often than prescribed. Libervant can make your child sleepy or dizzy and can slow your child\u2019s thinking and motor skills. Do not allow your child to drive a motor vehicle, operate machinery, or ride a bicycle until you know how Libervant affects your child. Do not give other drugs that may make your child sleepy or dizzy while taking Libervant without first talking to your child\u2019s healthcare provider. When taken with drugs that cause sleepiness or dizziness, Libervant may make your child\u2019s sleepiness or dizziness much worse. Like other antiepileptic medicines, Libervant may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a small number of people, about 1 in 500. Call a healthcare provider right away if your child has any of these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: thoughts about suicide or dying new or worse depression feeling agitated or restless trouble sleeping (insomnia) acting aggressive, being angry or violent other unusual changes in behavior or mood attempts to commit suicide new or worse anxiety or irritability an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) new or worse panic attacks acting on dangerous impulses Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. Keep all follow-up visits with your child\u2019s healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your child\u2019s healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms. Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If your child has suicidal thoughts or actions, your child\u2019s healthcare provider may check for other causes. What are the possible side effects of Libervant? The most common side effects of Libervant are sleepiness and headache. These are not all the possible side effects of Libervant. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.

( NASDAQ:AQST ) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 25% in that time. While that might be a setback, it doesn't negate the nice returns received over the last twelve months. In that time we've seen the stock easily surpass the market return, with a gain of 88%. With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for Aquestive Therapeutics Aquestive Therapeutics isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually desire strong revenue growth. That's because fast revenue growth can be easily extrapolated to forecast profits, often of considerable size. In the last year Aquestive Therapeutics saw its revenue grow by 23%. That's a fairly respectable growth rate. Buyers pushed the share price 88% in response, which isn't unreasonable. If revenue stays on trend, there may be plenty more share price gains to come. But it's crucial to check profitability and cash flow before forming a view on the future. The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image). NasdaqGM:AQST Earnings and Revenue Growth December 17th 2024 Take a more thorough look at Aquestive Therapeutics' financial health with this free report on its balance sheet . A Different Perspective It's good to see that Aquestive Therapeutics has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 88% in the last twelve months. Notably the five-year annualised TSR loss of 6% per year compares very unfavourably with the recent share price performance. This makes us a little wary, but the business might have turned around its fortunes. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - Aquestive Therapeutics has 3 warning signs (and 1 which doesn't sit too well with us) we think you should know about.

U.S. FDA Orphan Drug Exclusivity for Libervant\u00ae (diazepam) Buccal Film in Pediatric Patients with Seizure Clusters Ages Two to Five Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. Thu, Dec 19, 2024, 4:00 PM 11 min read In This Article: AQST -4.30% Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. U.S. FDA Orphan Drug exclusivity provides seven years of market exclusivity for Libervant\u00ae (diazepam) Buccal Film in the United States for the treatment of seizure clusters in patients ages 2 to 5 WARREN, N.J., Dec. 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: AQST) (\u201cAquestive\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a pharmaceutical company advancing medicines to bring meaningful improvement to patients' lives through innovative science and delivery technologies, today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity (ODE) to Libervant\u00ae (diazepam) Buccal Film for the acute treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity ( i.e ., seizure clusters, acute repetitive seizures) that are distinct from a patient\u2019s usual seizure pattern in patients with epilepsy between two to five years of age. On April 26, 2024, Libervant\u00ae (diazepam) Buccal Film was approved for pediatric patients between two to five years of age. FDA granted ODE based on their assessment that Libervant\u2019s buccal route of administration provides a major contribution to patient care over the rectal route of administration by providing a significantly improved ease of use. \u201cAs the first and only orally administered rescue therapy for this patient population, Libervant provides patients and caregivers an important, non-invasive treatment option,\u201d said Daniel Barber, Chief Executive Officer of Aquestive. \u201cWe remain focused on ensuring that healthcare providers are educated on the benefits of Libervant and patients and caregivers within the indicated population have the best possible access to the product.\u201d The FDA\u2019s Office of Orphan Products Development grants orphan designation status to drugs and biologics that are intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases, or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. The designation provides certain benefits, including financial incentives, to support clinical development and the potential for up to 7 years of market exclusivity in the U.S. upon regulatory approval. Libervant was originally granted Orphan Drug Designation on November 10, 2016 and the ODE now granted to Libervant for patients ages two to five extends to April of 2031. Libervant\u00ae (diazepam) Buccal Film is the first and only FDA approved orally administered rescue product for the treatment of seizure clusters in patients with epilepsy between two to five years of age. About Libervant Libervant is a buccally, or inside of the cheek, administered film formulation of diazepam, a benzodiazepine intended for the acute treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity ( i.e. , seizure clusters, acute repetitive seizures) that are distinct from a patient\u2019s usual seizure pattern in patients with epilepsy two to five years of age. Aquestive developed Libervant as an alternative to the device-based products currently available for patients with refractory epilepsy, including rectal gel and nasal spray products. The FDA granted tentative approval in August 2022 for Libervant for treatment of these epilepsy patients 12 years of age and older, with U.S. market access for Libervant for this age group of patients subject to the expiration of the existing orphan drug market exclusivity of a previously FDA approved drug scheduled to expire in January 2027. The FDA approval for U.S. market access received in April 2024 for Libervant is for these epilepsy patients between two and five years of age. Story Continues Important Safety Information Do not give Libervant\u00ae to your child if your child is allergic to diazepam or any of the ingredients in Libervant or has an eye problem called acute narrow angle glaucoma. What is the most important information I should know about Libervant? Libervant is a benzodiazepine medicine. Taking benzodiazepines with opioid medicines, alcohol, or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (including street drugs) can cause severe drowsiness, breathing problems (respiratory depression), coma, and death. Get emergency help right away if any of the following happens: shallow or slowed breathing, breathing stops (which may lead to the heart stopping), excessive sleepiness (sedation). Do not allow your child to drive a motor vehicle, operate heavy machinery, or ride a bicycle until you know how taking Libervant with opioids affects your child. Risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Libervant is used in children 2 to 5 years of age. The unapproved use of Libervant has a risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose and serious side effects including coma and death. Serious side effects including coma and death have happened in people who have abused or misused benzodiazepines, including diazepam (the active ingredient in Libervant). These serious side effects may also include delirium, paranoia, suicidal thoughts or actions, seizures, and difficulty breathing. Call your child\u2019s healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you get any of these serious side effects. Your child can develop an addiction even if your child takes Libervant as prescribed by your child\u2019s healthcare provider. Give Libervant exactly as your child\u2019s healthcare provider prescribed. Do not share Libervant with other people. Keep Libervant in a safe place and away from children. Physical dependence and withdrawal reactions. Libervant is intended for use if needed in order to treat higher than usual seizure activity. Benzodiazepines, including Libervant, can cause physical dependence and withdrawal reactions, especially if used daily. Libervant is not intended for daily use. Do not suddenly stop giving Libervant to your child without talking to your child\u2019s healthcare provider. Stopping Libervant suddenly can cause serious and life-threatening side effects, including, unusual movements, responses, or expressions, seizures that will not stop (status epilepticus), sudden and severe mental or nervous system changes, depression, seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear, homicidal thoughts, an extreme increase in activity or talking, losing touch with reality, and suicidal thoughts or actions. Call your child\u2019s healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if your child gets any of these symptoms. Some people who suddenly stop benzodiazepines have symptoms that can last for several weeks to more than 12 months including, anxiety, trouble remembering, learning, or concentrating, depression, problems sleeping, feeling like insects are crawling under your skin, weakness, shaking, muscle twitching, burning, or prickling feeling in your hands, arms, legs or feet, and ringing in your ears. Physical dependence is not the same as drug addiction. Your child\u2019s healthcare provider can tell you more about the differences between physical dependence and drug addiction. Do not give your child more Libervant than prescribed or give Libervant more often than prescribed. Libervant can make your child sleepy or dizzy and can slow your child\u2019s thinking and motor skills. Do not allow your child to drive a motor vehicle, operate machinery, or ride a bicycle until you know how Libervant affects your child. Do not give other drugs that may make your child sleepy or dizzy while taking Libervant without first talking to your child\u2019s healthcare provider. When taken with drugs that cause sleepiness or dizziness, Libervant may make your child\u2019s sleepiness or dizziness much worse. Like other antiepileptic medicines, Libervant may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a small number of people, about 1 in 500. Call a healthcare provider right away if your child has any of these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: thoughts about suicide or dying new or worse depression feeling agitated or restless trouble sleeping (insomnia) acting aggressive, being angry or violent other unusual changes in behavior or mood attempts to commit suicide new or worse anxiety or irritability an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) new or worse panic attacks acting on dangerous impulses Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. Keep all follow-up visits with your child\u2019s healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your child\u2019s healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms. Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If your child has suicidal thoughts or actions, your child\u2019s healthcare provider may check for other causes. What are the possible side effects of Libervant? The most common side effects of Libervant are sleepiness and headache. These are not all the possible side effects of Libervant. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.

EpiPen Alternative Aquestive Stock Undervalued Despite Strong Clinical Data, Analyst Sees Huge Upside Vandana Singh Tue, Dec 17, 2024, 9:56 PM 2 min read In This Article: AQST -4.30% Developer Of EpiPen Alternative Aquestive Stock Undervalued Despite Strong Clinical Data, Analyst Sees Huge Upside Cantor initiated coverage on Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc . (NASDAQ: AQST ), a pharmaceutical company with five commercialized products. The company also collaborates with pharmaceutical companies to bring new molecules to market using its technologies, like PharmFilm. Aquestive is advancing a late-stage proprietary product candidate for severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, and an earlier-stage epinephrine prodrug topical gel for various dermatology conditions. Cantor highlights that the company\u2019s secret sauce is focused on the PharmFilm technology, which delivers active pharmaceutical ingredients via oral routes (e.g., buccal, sublingual, and lingual). The core focus of the story right now is Anaphylm, which is in pre-NDA stage development for Type 1 allergic reactions. Cantor initiates with an Overweight rating and a price forecast of $17 . Also Read: Optimism Around Aquestive As it Moves Forward With Severe Allergy, Baldness Candidate Earlier this month, the company reaffirmed the New Drug Application first quarter 2025 submission guidance for Anaphylm and confirmed that no additional adult clinical trials are necessary before NDA submission. The company has commenced pediatric trials in the U.S. and Canada . Cantor writes that Aquestive shares are trading well below estimated peak sales for Anaphylm despite the company producing significant data supporting its comparable profile to epinephrine auto-injectors (and, in some situations, improvements). \u201cWe\u2019d be buyers for the potential of this program alone and think shares could be up >200% in 2025 if approved,\u201d the Cantor analyst writes. Cantor writes that Anaphylm\u2019s sublingual epinephrine could shake up the epinephrine auto-injector market as: The product is highly portable, about the size of a postage stamp, and can fit in a pocket or behind a cell phone. It may be quicker and easier to use than traditional auto-injectors, with fewer steps involved, which could make it more appealing for patients and caregivers. Anaphylm U.S. marketing application submission makes up most of Cantor\u2019s revenue projections for Aquestive. Price Action: AQST stock is up 7.31% at $3.86 at last check Tuesday.

the Best Multibagger Stock to Buy Heading into 2025? Affan Mir Sat, Nov 16, 2024, 9:25 AM 5 min read In This Article: AQST -4.30% We recently published a list of 10 Best Multibagger Stocks To Buy Heading into 2025 .\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:AQST) stands against other best multibagger stocks. November has been an eventful month so far for the market as the Fed cut rates by a quarter percentage and president-elect, Donald Trump won the election for the second time. The market reacted positively to these events as the major indices touched all-time highs and even Bitcoin finally broke off its shell after many months, reaching an all-time high of $93,000. More recently, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that solid economic growth, low unemployment, and inflation above 2% mean there\u2019s no urgency to cut interest rates. Speaking in Dallas, Powell said inflation is on a path toward the Fed's 2% target, allowing for cautious policy adjustments. He highlighted the economy's strong fundamentals but acknowledged persistent inflation pressures. While a rate cut is expected by the market in December, it anticipates fewer cuts next year due to steady inflation and policy uncertainties. According to the CME FedWatch, 62.4% of the interest rate traders expect a 25 bps rate cut in December. However, in January, 55.5% of the market anticipates the rates to remain the same after the December cut. Powell emphasized that the Fed will monitor inflation closely, especially housing costs, as it aims to reach its target sustainably.

Election Boosts Market Optimism but Risks Remain Stuart Kaiser, Citi's head of equity trading strategy recently joined CNBC\u2019s Closing Bell . In the post-election discussion, Kaiser expressed a generally optimistic outlook, with confidence that the markets have cleared the immediate uncertainties related to the election. Kaiser noted a temporary boost from this event but emphasized that moving forward, market focus will return to U.S. economic growth, the Fed\u2019s actions, and corporate earnings. While he believes valuations are currently more justifiable with expected growth from deregulation and new policy changes, he remains cautious about risks tied to bond market movements and rising yields. He suggested that rising yields linked to economic growth are manageable for equities, but warned against yields climbing due to fiscal or tariff issues, which could unsettle the market. Regarding equity strategy, Kaiser advocated a cautious approach to small-cap investments, preferring high-quality, profitable small caps due to their domestic focus, which could shield them from trade policy risks impacting larger companies. Additionally, although Kaiser doesn't handle non-traditional assets directly, he acknowledged that assets like Bitcoin might gain traction in a strong economic or supportive policy environment.

Positive FDA Feedback and Reaffirms NDA Submission Guidance for Anaphylm\u2122 (epinephrine) Sublingual Film Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. Mon, Dec 2, 2024, 4:00 PM 9 min read In This Article: AQST -4.30% Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. Reaffirms New Drug Application (NDA) first quarter 2025 submission guidance Confirms no additional adult clinical trials are necessary prior to NDA submission Commenced pediatric trial in the U.S. and Canada WARREN, N.J., Dec. 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: AQST), a pharmaceutical company advancing medicines to bring meaningful improvement to patients' lives through innovative science and delivery technologies (\u201cAquestive,\u201d the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d), today announced receipt of positive feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prior to its planned NDA submission for Anaphylm\u2122 (epinephrine) Sublingual Film. Anaphylm has the potential to be the first and only orally delivered epinephrine product for the treatment of severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, if approved by the FDA. \u201cWe believe FDA alignment on the completeness of our adult development program for Anaphylm is a major milestone for the Company and the allergy community,\u201d said Daniel Barber, President and Chief Executive Officer of Aquestive. \u201cWe have commenced our single-dose pediatric trial in December 2024, and we believe we have a clear path to an NDA submission in the first quarter of 2025. Currently, the estimated 33 million Americans with food allergies only have the option of carrying epinephrine medical devices. Our engagement with the allergy community continues to inform us that bringing the first and only orally delivered epinephrine product for anaphylaxis to market can potentially be transformative for patients. This patient community deserves continued innovation that creates easy-to-carry, easy-to-administer alternatives to today\u2019s approved medical devices.\u201d In a written response, the FDA agreed with the Company\u2019s planned NDA content and format for the submission, planned safety evaluation, and planned pediatric trial, which has commenced at both U.S. and Canadian sites. The FDA also provided further guidance on additional data views to be included in the planned NDA submission and continued to emphasize their focus on pharmacokinetic sustainability for a single dose. In addition, the FDA requested minor modifications to the Company\u2019s pediatric trial protocol. We have incorporated these FDA requested changes in the final pediatric trial protocol and do not expect these changes to have any significant impact on the planned timing of the pediatric trial. Finally, the FDA noted that due to the new route of administration and the data supporting this route of administration, an advisory committee meeting may be necessary.\u00a0\u00a0 Further details regarding the FDA\u2019s comments are available on the Events and Presentation section of the Investor page on the Aquestive website. Story Continues About Anaphylm\u2122 (epinephrine) Sublingual Film Anaphylm\u2122 (epinephrine) Sublingual Film is a polymer matrix-based epinephrine prodrug product candidate. Anaphylm is similar in size to a postage stamp, weighs less than an ounce, and begins to dissolve on contact. No water or swallowing is required for administration. The packaging for Anaphylm is thinner and smaller than an average credit card, can be carried in a pocket, and is designed to withstand weather excursions such as exposure to rain and/or sunlight. The Anaphylm trade name for AQST-109 has been conditionally approved by the FDA. Final approval of the Anaphylm proprietary name is conditioned on FDA approval of the product candidate.
