Funds? Ali Ahmed Sat, Dec 28, 2024, 12:14 AM 6 min read In This Article: WLLBW We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Gas Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chord Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHRD) stands against the other gas stocks. The Future of Natural Gas: Sustained Growth Ahead? The global gas industry plays a crucial role in the energy landscape, providing a relatively cleaner alternative to coal and oil. As countries aim to reduce carbon emissions and transition to more sustainable energy sources, natural gas has become increasingly important. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global natural gas market was valued at $1.029 trillion in 2023. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7% during 2024-2028 to reach a value of $1.518 trillion by the end of the forecast period. The Asia-Pacific region was the largest market for natural gas globally in 2023. The International Energy Agency\u2019s 2024 Global Gas Security Review indicates that natural gas consumption rose by 2.8% in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to the previous year, surpassing the average growth rate of 2% seen from 2010 to 2020. Most of this increase came from rapidly growing markets in Asia. However, estimates show that the growth rate slowed to below 2% in the third quarter of 2024, partly due to a recovery in demand that began in late 2023 and also because higher gas prices affected consumption. For the full year of 2024, global gas demand is projected to increase by over 2.5%, reaching a record high of 4,200 billion cubic meters (bcm). The Asia-Pacific region is expected to contribute nearly 45% of this additional demand. A significant portion of this growth is driven by industrial and energy use, supported by ongoing economic growth in Asia. Additionally, Europe\u2019s industrial gas demand is recovering. Looking ahead, global gas demand is anticipated to rise by another 2.3% in 2025, with Asia continuing to play a crucial role in driving this growth.

Natural gas plants are more efficient and produce fewer emissions compared to traditional coal-fired plants. According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), in 2023, the United States consumed 32.50 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, which represents around 36% of the country\u2019s total energy consumption. The electric power sector was the largest user, consuming approximately 40% of the total natural gas. Natural gas accounted for about 42% of the energy used in electricity generation in 2023. Story Continues In addition to this, innovations in extraction technologies, such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, have made it easier and more cost-effective to produce natural gas. These advancements are enhancing supply capabilities and driving down costs, further supporting market growth.

Oil and Gas Stocks To Invest In According to Hedge Funds? Sultan Khalid Sun, Dec 22, 2024, 10:46 PM 7 min read In This Article: WLLBW We recently published a list of Top 12 Oil and Gas Stocks To Invest In According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chord Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHRD) stands against oil and gas stocks to invest in according to hedge funds. With a record average production of 12.9 million barrels per day in 2023, the United States is the Biggest Oil Producing Country in the World . Every year, the indigenous production of oil and gas helps save American consumers an estimated $203 billion, or $2,500 for each family of four. Moreover, the oil and gas industry supports over 12 million American jobs, provides billions of dollars in tax revenue, and ensures energy security. READ ALSO: 11 Best Cannabis Stocks to Invest In Global Demand for Oil in 2023 According to OPEC, the global oil demand increased by 2.5 million barrels per day (mb/d) in 2023 to average 102.2 mb/d, surpassing pre-pandemic levels for the first time. The major part of this uptick came from the non-OECD countries, which posted YoY growth of about 2.4 mb/d to average 56.4 mb/d, surpassing pre-pandemic levels for the second consecutive year. As per the IEA\u2019s recent market outlook, growth in the global demand for oil is expected to slow down in the coming years as energy transitions advance. However, despite the sluggish growth, the world oil demand is still forecast to be 3.2 mb/d higher in 2030 than in 2023, unless stronger policy measures are implemented or changes in behavior take hold. Future Outlook of the Global Oil Industry As 2024 comes to a close, oil prices have moved in the narrowest range this year since 2019, with Brent crude oil prices exhibiting a minimal average monthly change and a monthly range-bound movement between $69 and $90. The general opinion is that a soft demand, coupled with an abundant supply, even on hold, has contributed to the relative stability we witnessed this year. China\u2019s faltering economy and its shift towards electric vehicles and LNG-fueled trucks weighed heavily on the crude oil demand this year. According to a recent report by the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, the world\u2019s largest oil-importing country may see its demand peak in 2025, five years earlier than expected, as the shift away from fossil fuels accelerates. The report reveals that China\u2019s oil demand could reach 770 million tons next year, before gradually falling to 240 million tons by 2060. As a consequence of the slowdown in the global oil demand, Brent futures prices have shed more than 5% so far this year, setting up a second consecutive annual loss. J.P. Morgan analysts have predicted that the global oil market is widely expected to be in a surplus in 2025, as supply will outpace demand to the tune of 1.2 million b/d. Brent crude prices are forecast to average around $73 a barrel next year, according to a Reuters tally of 11 brokerages that have issued price targets. Story Continues The bleak outlook has inevitably caused the oil and gas stocks to tumble and the broader market\u2019s Energy sector has dropped by 13.42% over the last month, while the overall market has stayed relatively stable and lost only 0.3% during the same period. However, despite the falling prices and decreasing margins, the oil and gas industry is contributing massively to the global economy and shareholder return. A recent report from Deloitte has revealed that the O&G sector distributed nearly $213 billion in dividends and $136 billion in buybacks between January 2024 and mid-November 2024. Also, over the last four years, the industry\u2019s capital expenditures have increased by 53%, while its net profit has risen by nearly 16%. Moreover, an increasing number of oil majors are now investing in low-carbon technology projects to help balance the risks associated with the traditional fossil fuel market. Methodology To collect data for this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds and picked the top 8 companies operating in the oil and gas sector with the highest number of hedge fund investors. When two or more companies had the same number of hedge funds investing in them, we ranked them by the revenue of their last financial year instead. Following are the Best Energy Stocks Held by the Most Hedge Funds . At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Is Chord Energy Corporation (CHRD) Among Top Oil and Gas Stocks To Invest In According to Hedge Funds? A technician in a lab coat examining a sample of crude oil. Chord Energy Corporation (NASDAQ: CHRD ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50 Chord Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHRD) is an independent exploration and production company, with an immense focus on acquiring and developing oil and natural gas properties. Chord finalized its acquisition of Enerplus in June, significantly expanding its footprint and making it the largest producer in the Bakken. However, while the merger comes with a plethora of opportunities, integration challenges could potentially affect the company\u2019s near-term performance. Chord Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHRD) had a strong Q3 2024 as its oil volumes were toward the top end of guidance, driven by strong execution, well performance, and lower downtime. As a result, the Texas-based company generated an adjusted free cash flow of $312 million and a net income of $225.3 million. Chord also announced a base dividend of $1.25 per share and repurchased shares worth $146 million during the quarter. The company\u2019s commitment to returning 75% of its free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks presents significant potential upside for investors. Chord Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHRD) also remains focused on becoming more sustainable and reported a 9% decrease in operated Scope 1 GHG emissions intensity in 2023 as compared to 2022 and a 57% decrease as compared to 2019. Additionally, it also witnessed a 44% decline in operated Scope 1 methane emissions intensity last year when compared to 2022 and a 70% decrease as compared to 2019. 50 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held shares of Chord Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHRD) at the end of Q3 2024, with Point72 Asset Management holding the largest stake of 880,787 shares, valued at over $114.7 million. Carillon Tower Advisers stated the following about Chord Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHRD) in its Q3 investment letter: \u201cChord Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHRD) is an independent exploration and production company with operations in the Williston Basin in North Dakota, Montana, and South Dakota. The company\u2019s shares lagged largely due to the recent pressure in the price of oil. Some recent data indicating slightly disappointing initial well productivity from a handful of recently completed wells also contributed to lackluster performance. Despite this, we remain optimistic on management\u2019s ability to drive operational efficiencies following the recent close of Chord\u2019s acquisition of Enerplus, by applying best practices of both independent companies in a manner that should provide upside to the previously communicated synergies. We believe the continued successful implementation of Chord\u2019s 3-mile lateral strategy, which entails drilling both vertically and horizontally for distances longer than in 2-mile lateral wells, also could drive increased shareholder returns.\u201d Overall, CHRD ranks 8th on our list of oil and gas stocks to invest in according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for CHRD to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CHRD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock .

WTI Chord Energy Corporation (CHRD) came out with quarterly earnings of $3.40 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.64 per share. This compares to earnings of $5.04 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -6.59%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $5 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.69, delivering a surprise of -6.20%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. Chord Energy Corporation , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, posted revenues of $1.45 billion for the quarter ended September 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.13%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.12 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Chord Energy Corporation shares have lost about 23.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 21.2%. What's Next for Chord Energy Corporation? While Chord Energy Corporation has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Chord Energy Corporation: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock.

Chord Energy Corporation (CHRD) Make You Rich In 2025? Talha Qureshi Wed, Dec 25, 2024, 7:28 AM 5 min read In This Article: WLLBW We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks That Will Make You Rich In 2025 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chord Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHRD) stands against the other stocks that will make you rich in 2025. What to Expect from the Stock Market in 2025 Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity Management & Research Company, recently shared his outlook for the stock market in 2025. His analysis reflects cautious optimism, emphasizing potential growth and significant risks. Timmer described 2024 as a \"Goldilocks\" year for U.S. stock returns, characterized by robust earnings growth and rising valuations. The S&P 500 Index experienced a substantial increase, concluding the year with a gain of approximately 28% as it reached new all-time highs. This performance was driven by strong earnings from major companies, particularly the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks whose growth has significantly influenced the overall market dynamics.

Looking ahead to 2025, Timmer maintained a bullish stance on stocks but cautioned that investors should not expect returns to match the spectacular gains of the previous two years. He noted that while earnings forecasts remain strong, especially for the mega-cap stocks, valuations are stretched, currently sitting in the 90th percentile historically. This suggests that significant further expansion in price-to-earnings (PE) ratios could lead to a bubble scenario, which he believes is unlikely. He expects continued earnings growth to support stock prices in 2025. However, valuations may limit future growth. Timmer suggests that earnings must drive performance rather than further valuation expansion to avoid a bubble scenario. With the bull market entering its third year, Timmer describes it as being in \"later innings,\" indicating increased caution regarding future performance. He also suggested several risks that could potentially impact the market in 2025. For instance, heavy reliance on a few mega-cap stocks poses a risk; if these stocks falter, it could drag down overall market performance despite broader participation from other stocks. Secondly, although he does not foresee a return to the high inflation rates of the past decades, he warns that rising inflation could lead to higher interest rates, which would negatively affect the stock market. Our Methodology To compile the list of 10 stocks that will make you rich in 2025, we conducted a consensus. We sifted through various internet rankings to get an initial list of stocks expected to explode in 2025. Next, we sourced analyst sentiment for each stock from CNN and ranked our list in ascending order of the analysts' projected upside potential for the next twelve months. Please note that the data was recorded on Friday, December 20, 2024. Story Continues Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ( see more details here ). Is Chord Energy Corporation (CHRD) Among Top Oil and Gas Stocks To Invest In According to Hedge Funds? A technician in a lab coat examining a sample of crude oil. Chord Energy Corporation (NASDAQ: CHRD ) Analysts Upside Potential: 64.67% Chord Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHRD) is an independent company that focuses on exploring and producing oil and natural gas. It primarily operates in the Williston Basin, which spans parts of North Dakota and Montana. This area is known for its rich deposits of oil and gas, particularly in formations called the Middle Bakken and Three Forks. On March 31, the company reported completing its merger with Enerplus Corporation, creating a leading exploration and production (E&P) company focused on the Williston Basin. The newly formed company boasts a substantial land position of about 1.3 million net acres in the area. The combined entity expects to achieve over $200 million in annual synergies, exceeding initial estimates. During the fiscal third quarter of 2024, Chord Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHRD) reported strong financial and operational results. Oil production for the company reached 158.8 thousand barrels per day (MBopd), close to the upper limit of its guidance, and total production was 280.8 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBoepd), which also exceeded expectations. As a result total revenue of approximately $1.45 billion increased 38% year-over-year, generating $225.3 million as net income. It is one of the 10 stocks that can make you rich in 2025. Carillon Tower Advisers stated the following about Chord Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHRD) in its Q3 2024 investment letter : \u201cChord Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHRD) is an independent exploration and production company with operations in the Williston Basin in North Dakota, Montana, and South Dakota. The company\u2019s shares lagged largely due to the recent pressure on the price of oil. Some recent data indicating slightly disappointing initial well productivity from a handful of recently completed wells also contributed to lackluster performance. Despite this, we remain optimistic about management\u2019s ability to drive operational efficiencies following the recent close of Chord\u2019s acquisition of Enerplus, by applying best practices of both independent companies in a manner that should provide upside to the previously communicated synergies. We believe the continued successful implementation of Chord\u2019s 3-mile lateral strategy, which entails drilling both vertically and horizontally for distances longer than in 2-mile lateral wells, also could drive increased shareholder returns.\u201d Overall CHRD ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks that will make you rich in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of CHRD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Shareholders Have More To Worry About Than Only Soft Earnings editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Thu, Nov 14, 2024, 2:42 PM 3 min read In This Article: CHRD WLLBW Chord Energy Corporation's ( NASDAQ:CHRD ) recent weak earnings report didn't cause a big stock movement. We think that investors are worried about some weaknesses underlying the earnings. View our latest analysis for Chord Energy NasdaqGS:CHRD Earnings and Revenue History November 14th 2024 In order to understand the potential for per share returns, it is essential to consider how much a company is diluting shareholders. As it happens, Chord Energy issued 48% more new shares over the last year. Therefore, each share now receives a smaller portion of profit. To talk about net income, without noticing earnings per share, is to be distracted by the big numbers while ignoring the smaller numbers that talk to per share value. You can see a chart of Chord Energy's EPS by clicking here . A Look At The Impact Of Chord Energy's Dilution On Its Earnings Per Share (EPS) Chord Energy has improved its profit over the last three years, with an annualized gain of 78% in that time. Net profit actually dropped by 15% in the last year. Unfortunately for shareholders, though, the earnings per share result was even worse, declining 26%. So you can see that the dilution has had a fairly significant impact on shareholders. If Chord Energy's EPS can grow over time then that drastically improves the chances of the share price moving in the same direction. However, if its profit increases while its earnings per share stay flat (or even fall) then shareholders might not see much benefit. For the ordinary retail shareholder, EPS is a great measure to check your hypothetical \"share\" of the company's profit. That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.

Our Take On Chord Energy's Profit Performance Chord Energy issued shares during the year, and that means its EPS performance lags its net income growth. As a result, we think it may well be the case that Chord Energy's underlying earnings power is lower than its statutory profit. But the good news is that its EPS growth over the last three years has been very impressive. At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly. So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Chord Energy at this point in time. At Simply Wall St, we found 2 warning signs for Chord Energy and we think they deserve your attention. This note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of Chord Energy's profit. But there is always more to discover if you are capable of focussing your mind on minutiae.

This strong performance supported the continued execution of Chord's shareholder return strategy, which included a meaningful increase to share repurchases in the third quarter. Chord's valuation is compelling, and we expect share repurchases to comprise a significant portion of future shareholder returns, especially at current prices. In addition, three-mile lateral development continues to be a key factor driving a positive rate of change through our business, and we are seeing recoveries proportional to the increased lateral length. As a result, we are updating the productivity factor of the third mile to 100%. Congratulations to the Chord team for continuing to challenge themselves to raise the bar. Your hard work is evident in our company's success.\" Story Continues Mr. Brown continued, \"Since closing, the Chord team has been working diligently to integrate the Enerplus assets, drive synergy capture and enhance efficiency. I'm pleased to announce a new three-year outlook, which results in holding oil volumes flat with pro forma 2024 levels from 2025 through 2027 and annual capital expenditures of $1.4 billion per year. This outcome is a material improvement in capital efficiency and illustrates the quality and depth of our inventory. Chord is a premier Williston Basin operator with enhanced scale, significant low-cost inventory, financial strength and peer-leading shareholder returns. Chord's durable free cash flow generation is evident in our improving capital efficiency and compelling long-term financial outlook.

Chord had 46 gross (36.0 net) operated turn-in-line (\"TIL\") wells in 3Q24. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , net cash provided by operating activities was $663 .2MM and net income was $225 .3MM ( $3.59 /diluted share). Adjusted EBITDA was $674 .5MM, Adjusted Free Cash Flow was $312 .5MM and Adjusted Net Income was $212 .8MM ( $3.40 /diluted share). Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Net Income are non-GAAP financial measures. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measures under GAAP. Return of Capital: Chord declared a base-plus-variable cash dividend of $1.44 per share of common stock, including a base dividend of $1.25 per share of common stock and a variable dividend of $0.19 per share of common stock. The dividends will be payable on December\u00a012, 2024 to shareholders of record as of November\u00a027, 2024. Details regarding the calculation of the variable dividend can be found in the Company's most recent investor presentation located on its website at https://ir.chordenergy.com/presentations . During 3Q24, the Company repurchased 951,417 shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $153.50 per share totaling $146 .0MM. Share repurchases represented more than 90% of shareholder returns after the base dividend in 3Q24. Chord's Board of Directors has authorized a new share repurchase program totaling $750MM, which replaces the existing program which had approximately $445MM remaining at September 30, 2024 . Acquisition and Divestiture: During 3Q24, Chord entered into a definitive agreement to divest its entire position in the DJ Basin. On October 25, 2024 , Chord completed the sale of the DJ Basin assets and received net proceeds (after customary purchase price adjustments) of $36 .1MM. Chord expects to use the net proceeds from the DJ Basin divestiture to fund recent acquisitions and repurchase shares of common stock in 4Q24. Additionally, during 3Q24, Chord entered into agreements to acquire additional working interests in operated assets in the Williston Basin for total cash consideration of $7 .0MM,\u00a0which was funded with cash on hand. The net volume impact of these portfolio changes is expected to reduce 4Q24 oil volumes by approximately 0.4 MBopd. 2025 \u2013 2027 Outlook: Chord expects to spend $1.4B of capital per year for each of the next three years (2025 \u2013 2027) to maintain flat pro forma FY24 oil volumes of 152 MBopd \u2013 153 MBopd. Chord's three-year outlook reflects the improving capital efficiency of its program, supported by high-quality inventory, enhanced operational efficiencies and over $200MM of synergies from the combination with Enerplus. Updated 2024 Outlook: Chord is updating its FY24 guidance to reflect 3Q24 results and its 4Q24 outlook. Chord expects to generate approximately $2.7B of Adjusted EBITDA and $1.1B of Adjusted Free Cash Flow on a pro forma basis in FY24, with a reinvestment rate less than 60%. Chord's updated outlook reflects actual pricing for 1Q24 \u2013 3Q24 and $70 /Bbl WTI and $2.50 /MMBtu Henry Hub for 4Q24. Full year oil volumes updated to account for strong 3Q24 performance and the latest 4Q24 outlook, which includes the impact of October wildfires and recent A&D activity. Pro forma FY24 midpoint oil volumes of 152.7 MBopd increased 0.6 MBopd from August guidance (including the impact of A&D), representing the second increase in oil guidance this year; FY24 pro forma capital guidance reduced $10MM to $1.48B , reflecting program efficiencies and lower spending. 4Q24 capital reflects program timing and some deferred spending from 3Q24; Full year natural gas and NGL volumes adjusted to reflect latest estimates on volume mix and activity deferrals in the Marcellus shale; Lowering 4Q24 oil differentials to reflect continued pricing improvement in the Williston Basin. Adjusting 4Q24 natural gas and NGL realizations to reflect current market conditions; Lowering FY24 LOE to reflect better than expected 3Q24 performance and improved 4Q24 outlook; Increasing production tax estimate to account for higher oil sales and lower gas prices; and Lowering cash tax guidance to reflect the acceleration of certain deferred tax benefits. In early October, wildfires spread in select areas of North Dakota . There were no injuries to Chord staff; however, the broader community suffered two fatalities and various homes and infrastructure were damaged. During the fires, Chord coordinated with authorities to proactively shut in certain sites and facilities. The impact of these curtailments reduced 4Q24 oil volumes by approximately 0.9 MBopd and is reflected in Chord's 4Q24 guidance below.

The Company believes that the foregoing are useful supplemental measures that provide an indication of the results generated by the Company's principal business activities. However, these measures are not recognized by GAAP and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP. Therefore, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other issuers. From time to time, the Company provides forward-looking forecasts of these measures; however, the Company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures because management cannot reliably quantify certain of the necessary components of such forward-looking GAAP measures. The reconciling items in future periods could be significant. To see how the Company reconciles its historical presentations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please visit the Investors\u2014Documents & Disclosures\u2014Non-GAAP Reconciliation page on the Company's website at https://ir.chordenergy.com/non-gaap . Cash GPT The Company defines Cash GPT as total GPT expenses less non-cash valuation charges on pipeline imbalances and non-cash mark-to-market adjustments on transportation contracts accounted for as derivative instruments. Cash GPT is not a measure of GPT expenses as determined by GAAP. Management believes that the presentation of Cash GPT provides useful additional information to investors and analysts to assess the cash costs incurred to market and transport the Company's commodities from the wellhead to delivery points for sale without regard to the change in value of its pipeline imbalances, which vary monthly based on commodity prices, and without regard to the non-cash mark-to-market adjustments on transportation contracts classified as derivative instruments. The following table presents a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measure of GPT expenses to the non-GAAP financial measure of Cash GPT for the periods presented: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In thousands) GPT $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 77,353 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 52,294 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 194,467 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 132,706 Pipeline imbalances (2,114) 234 (2,796) (7,902) Gain (loss) on derivative transportation contracts (1) \u2014 (1,432) (5,877) 16,847 Cash GPT $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 75,239 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 51,096 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 185,794 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 141,651 ___________________ (1) The Company had buy/sell transportation contracts that qualified as derivatives. The changes in the fair value of these contracts was recorded to GPT expense. As of June 30, 2024, the term of all remaining contracts expired. Cash G&A The Company defines Cash G&A as total G&A expenses less G&A expenses directly attributable to certain merger and acquisition activity, non-cash equity-based compensation expenses and other non-cash charges. Cash G&A is not a measure of G&A expenses as determined by GAAP. Management believes that the presentation of Cash G&A provides useful additional information to investors and analysts to assess the Company's operating costs in comparison to peers without regard to the aforementioned charges, which can vary substantially from company to company. The following table presents a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measure of G&A expenses to the non-GAAP financial measure of Cash G&A for the periods presented: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In thousands) General and administrative expenses $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 52,115 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 26,117 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 159,904 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 100,775 Merger costs (1) (17,503) \u2014 (80,297) (9,701) Equity-based compensation expenses (5,918) (10,082) (16,053) (37,260) Other non-cash adjustments (829) (2,292) 633 (4,165) Cash G&A $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 27,865 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 13,743 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 64,187 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 49,649 ___________________ (1) Includes costs directly attributable to the arrangement with Enerplus for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\u00a0and the costs directly attributable to the merger of equals with Whiting Petroleum Corporation (\"Whiting\") for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash Interest The Company defines Cash Interest as interest expense plus capitalized interest less amortization and write-offs of deferred financing costs. Cash Interest is not a measure of interest expense as determined by GAAP. Management believes that the presentation of Cash Interest provides useful additional information to investors and analysts for assessing the interest charges incurred on the Company's debt to finance its operating activities and the Company's ability to maintain compliance with its debt covenants. The following table presents a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measure of interest expense to the non-GAAP financial measure of Cash Interest for the periods presented: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In thousands) Interest expense $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 19,146 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7,923 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 38,946 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 22,286 Capitalized interest 1,839 857 3,707 3,601 Amortization of deferred financing costs (1,140) (1,224) (3,398) (3,633) Cash Interest $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 19,845 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7,556 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 39,255 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 22,254 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization (\"DD&A\"), merger costs, exploration expenses, impairment expenses and other similar non-cash or non-recurring charges. The Company defines Adjusted Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA less Cash Interest and E&P and other capital expenditures (excluding capitalized interest and acquisition capital). Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are not measures of net income or cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP. Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow provides useful additional information to investors and analysts for assessing the Company's results of operations, financial performance, ability to generate cash from its business operations without regard to its financing methods or capital structure and the Company's ability to maintain compliance with its debt covenants.

(2) The nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes approximately $20.0MM of capital incurred related to divested non-operated assets that was reimbursed. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management and external users of the Company's financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. The Company defines Adjusted Net Income as net income after adjusting for (1)\u00a0the impact of certain non-cash items, including non-cash changes in the fair value of derivative instruments, non-cash changes in the fair value of the Company's investment in an unconsolidated affiliate, impairment and other similar non-cash charges, (2) merger costs and (3) the impact of taxes based on the Company's effective tax rate applicable to those adjusting items in the same period. Adjusted Net Income is not a measure of net income as determined by GAAP. The Company calculates earnings per share under the two-class method in accordance with GAAP. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that computes earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared (or accumulated) and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share is calculated as (i) Adjusted Net Income (ii) less distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities (iii) divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding for the periods presented. The following table presents reconciliations of the GAAP financial measure of net income to the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted Net Income and the GAAP financial measure of diluted earnings per share to the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share for the periods presented: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In thousands, except per share data) Net income $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 225,316 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 209,076 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 638,030 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 722,146 Net (gain) loss on derivative instruments (52,721) 85,205 (29,753) (11,247) Realized gain (loss) on commodity price derivative contracts 953 (63,131) (4,305) (206,229) Net gain from investment in unconsolidated affiliate (1,089) (13,512) (23,246) (21,421) Distributions from investment in unconsolidated affiliate 2,323 2,515 6,914 8,499 Impairment 5,919 \u2014 9,838 28,964 Merger costs (1) 17,503 \u2014 80,297 9,701 (Gain) loss on sale of assets 2,973 (899) (13,814) (3,739) Amortization of deferred financing costs 1,140 1,224 3,398 3,633 Other non-cash adjustments 7,118 4,246 11,018 (1,813) Tax impact (2) 4,145 (3,742) (9,802) 46,270 Adjusted net income 213,580 220,982 668,575 574,764 Distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities (734) (817) (2,681) (1,674) Adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 212,846 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 220,165 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 665,894 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 573,090 Diluted earnings per share $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.60 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4.79 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12.39 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 16.59 Net (gain) loss on derivative instruments (0.84) 1.95 (0.58) (0.26) Realized gain (loss) on commodity price derivative contracts 0.02 (1.45) (0.08) (4.74) Net gain from investment in unconsolidated affiliate (0.02) (0.31) (0.45) (0.49) Distributions from investment in unconsolidated affiliate 0.04 0.06 0.13 0.20 Impairment 0.09 \u2014 0.19 0.67 Merger costs (1) 0.28 \u2014 1.56 0.22 (Gain) loss on sale of assets 0.05 (0.02) (0.27) (0.09) Amortization of deferred financing costs 0.02 0.03 0.07 0.08 Other non-cash adjustments 0.11 0.10 0.21 (0.04) Tax impact (2) 0.06 (0.09) (0.19) 1.06 Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share 3.41 5.06 12.98 13.20 Less: Distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities (0.01) (0.02) (0.05) (0.04) Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.40 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5.04 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12.93 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 13.16 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 62,629 43,662 51,507 43,527 Effective tax rate applicable to adjustment items (2) 26.1\u00a0% 23.9\u00a0% 25.2\u00a0% 23.9\u00a0% _____________________ (1) Includes costs directly attributable to the arrangement with Enerplus for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\u00a0and the costs directly attributable to the merger of equals with Whiting for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
