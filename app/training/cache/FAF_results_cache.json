The report tracks home price changes less than four weeks behind real time at the national, state and metropolitan (Core-Based Statistical Area) levels and includes metropolitan price tiers that segment sale transactions into starter, mid and luxury tiers. The full report can be found here . December 1 Home Price Index Dallas-Plano-Irving Market Metric Change in HPI November-December 2024 (month over month) -0.1 percent December 2023-December 2024 (year over year) +0.7 percent National HPI Metric Change in HPI November-December 2024 (month over month) +0.1 percent December 2023-December 2024 (year over year) +3.9 percent Chief Economist National HPI Analysis: \"House price growth nationally started 2024 strong at a 7 percent annualized pace of growth but gradually slowed over the course of the year, ending in the high 3 percent year-over-year growth range. Higher mortgage rates in the latter half of the year, combined with higher inventory levels, triggered the cooling trend. If similar conditions persist through 2025, we should expect very moderate price appreciation,\" said Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American. \"Areas with rapid supply growth that outstrips demand may face stronger moderation or even price declines, while areas with limited new supply may see steadier price growth or even price reacceleration. The structural housing shortage nationally will keep a floor on how low prices can go, but a \u2018higher-for-longer\u2019 rate environment and inventory growth could cause further price moderation.\" Year-Over-Year Price-Tier Data for the Dallas-Plano-Irving Metro Area: December 2023 to December 2024 The First American Data & Analytics HPI segments home price changes at the metropolitan level into three price tiers based on local market sales data: starter tier, which represents home sales prices at the bottom third of the market price distribution; mid-tier, which represents home sales prices in the middle third of the market price distribution; and the luxury tier, which represents home sales prices in the top third of the market price distribution. Story Continues CBSA Starter Mid-Tier Luxury Dallas-Plano-Irving -0.6% +0.3% +3.3% \"House price growth has varied considerably at the regional level over the last year, largely driven by differences in for-sale inventories. As more homes become available, the power dynamics can shift in favor of buyers, putting downward pressure on prices,\" said Fleming. \"All else equal, house price growth in markets with higher inventory of homes available for sale will weaken compared to those with low inventory relative to demand.\" December 2024 First American Data & Analytics Price Tier HPI Highlights 2 Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) Ranked by Greatest Year-Over-Year Increases in Starter Tier HPI CBSA Change in Starter Tier HPI Change in Mid- Tier HPI Change in Luxury Tier HPI Pittsburgh +9.5 percent +2.7 percent +4.0 percent Cambridge, Mass. +6.0 percent +7.6 percent +6.8 percent New York +5.3 percent +5.2 percent +3.7 percent St. Louis +5.1 percent +2.9 percent +4.2 percent Anaheim, Calif. +5.0 percent +7.0 percent +6.6 percent Additional December 2024 First American Data & Analytics HPI Highlights Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) with Greatest Year-Over-Year Increases in HPI CBSA Change in HPI Anaheim, Calif. +6.1 percent Cambridge, Mass. +6.0 percent Pittsburgh +5.8 percent Las Vegas +4.4 percent Warren, Mich. +4.3 percent Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) with a Year-Over-Year Decease in HPI Tampa, Fla. -4.6 percent Oakland, Calif. -0.8 percent Austin, Texas -0.2 percent Los Angeles -0.1 percent San Antonio +0.5 percent HPI data for all 50 states and the largest 30 CBSAs by population is available here .

Next Release The next release of the First American Data & Analytics House Price Index will take place the week of February 17, 2025. First American Data & Analytics HPI Methodology The First American Data & Analytics HPI report measures single-family home prices, including distressed sales, with indices updated monthly beginning in 1980 through the month of the current report. HPI data is provided at the national, state and CBSA levels and includes preliminary index estimates for the month prior to the report (i.e. the preliminary result of July transactions is reported in August). The most recent index results are subject to revision as data from more transactions become available. The HPI uses a repeat-sales methodology, which measures price changes for the same property over time using more than 46 million paired transactions to generate the indices. In non-disclosure states, the HPI utilizes a combination of public sales records, MLS sold and active listings, and appraisal data to estimate house prices. This comprehensive approach is particularly effective in areas where there is limited availability of accurate sale prices, such as non-disclosure states. Property type, price and location data are used to create more refined market segment indices. Real Estate-Owned transactions are not included.

mortgage rates in the latter half of the year, combined with higher inventory levels, triggered the cooling trend, says Chief Economist Mark Fleming\u2014 SANTA ANA, Calif., January 27, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- First American Data & Analytics , a leading national provider of property-centric information, risk management and valuation solutions and a division of First American Financial Corporation (NYSE: FAF), today released its December 2024 Home Price Index (HPI) report. The report tracks home price changes less than four weeks behind real time at the national, state and metropolitan (Core-Based Statistical Area) levels and includes metropolitan price tiers that segment sale transactions into starter, mid and luxury tiers. The full report can be found here . December 1 Home Price Index Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale Market Metric Change in HPI November-December 2024 (month over month) -0.8 percent December 2023-December 2024 (year over year) -0.1 percent National HPI Metric Change in HPI November-December 2024 (month over month) +0.1 percent December 2023-December 2024 (year over year) +3.9 percent Chief Economist National HPI Analysis: \"House price growth nationally started 2024 strong at a 7 percent annualized pace of growth but gradually slowed over the course of the year, ending in the high 3 percent year-over-year growth range. Higher mortgage rates in the latter half of the year, combined with higher inventory levels, triggered the cooling trend. If similar conditions persist through 2025, we should expect very moderate price appreciation,\" said Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American. \"Areas with rapid supply growth that outstrips demand may face stronger moderation or even price declines, while areas with limited new supply may see steadier price growth or even price reacceleration. The structural housing shortage nationally will keep a floor on how low prices can go, but a \u2018higher-for-longer\u2019 rate environment and inventory growth could cause further price moderation.\" Year-Over-Year Price-Tier Data for the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale Metro Area: December 2023 to December 2024 The First American Data & Analytics HPI segments home price changes at the metropolitan level into three price tiers based on local market sales data: starter tier, which represents home sales prices at the bottom third of the market price distribution; mid-tier, which represents home sales prices in the middle third of the market price distribution; and the luxury tier, which represents home sales prices in the top third of the market price distribution. Story Continues CBSA Starter Mid-Tier Luxury Los Angeles-Long-Beach-Glendale -0.2% +2.0% +0.4% \"House price growth has varied considerably at the regional level over the last year, largely driven by differences in for-sale inventories. As more homes become available, the power dynamics can shift in favor of buyers, putting downward pressure on prices,\" said Fleming. \"All else equal, house price growth in markets with higher inventory of homes available for sale will weaken compared to those with low inventory relative to demand.\" December 2024 First American Data & Analytics Price Tier HPI Highlights 2 Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) Ranked by Greatest Year-Over-Year Increases in Starter Tier HPI CBSA Change in Starter Tier HPI Change in Mid-Tier HPI Change in Luxury Tier HPI Pittsburgh +9.5 percent +2.7 percent +4.0 percent Cambridge, Mass. +6.0 percent +7.6 percent +6.8 percent New York +5.3 percent +5.2 percent +3.7 percent St. Louis +5.1 percent +2.9 percent +4.2 percent Anaheim, Calif. +5.0 percent +7.0 percent +6.6 percent Additional December 2024 First American Data & Analytics HPI Highlights Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) with Greatest Year-Over-Year Increases in HPI CBSA Change in HPI Anaheim, Calif. +6.1 percent Cambridge, Mass. +6.0 percent Pittsburgh +5.8 percent Las Vegas +4.4 percent Warren, Mich. +4.3 percent Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) with a Year-Over-Year Decease in HPI Tampa, Fla. -4.6 percent Oakland, Calif. -0.8 percent Austin, Texas -0.2 percent Los Angeles -0.1 percent San Antonio +0.5 percent HPI data for all 50 states and the largest 30 CBSAs by population is available here .

Next Release The next release of the First American Data & Analytics House Price Index will take place the week of February 17, 2025. First American Data & Analytics HPI Methodology The First American Data & Analytics HPI report measures single-family home prices, including distressed sales, with indices updated monthly beginning in 1980 through the month of the current report. HPI data is provided at the national, state and CBSA levels and includes preliminary index estimates for the month prior to the report (i.e. the preliminary result of July transactions is reported in August). The most recent index results are subject to revision as data from more transactions become available. The HPI uses a repeat-sales methodology, which measures price changes for the same property over time using more than 46 million paired transactions to generate the indices. In non-disclosure states, the HPI utilizes a combination of public sales records, MLS sold and active listings, and appraisal data to estimate house prices. This comprehensive approach is particularly effective in areas where there is limited availability of accurate sale prices, such as non-disclosure states. Property type, price and location data are used to create more refined market segment indices. Real Estate-Owned transactions are not included.

combined with higher inventory levels, triggered the cooling trend, says Chief Economist Mark Fleming\u2014 SANTA ANA, Calif., January 27, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- First American Data & Analytics , a leading national provider of property-centric information, risk management and valuation solutions and a division of First American Financial Corporation (NYSE: FAF), today released its December 2024 Home Price Index (HPI) report. The report tracks home price changes less than four weeks behind real time at the national, state and metropolitan (Core-Based Statistical Area) levels and includes metropolitan price tiers that segment sale transactions into starter, mid and luxury tiers. The full report can be found here . December 1 Home Price Index Atlanta-Sandy Springs Alpharetta Market Metric Change in HPI November-December 2024 (month over month) 0.0 percent December 2023-December 2024 (year over year) +1.9 percent National HPI Metric Change in HPI November-December 2024 (month over month) +0.1 percent December 2023-December 2024 (year over year) +3.9 percent Chief Economist National HPI Analysis: \"House price growth nationally started 2024 strong at a 7 percent annualized pace of growth but gradually slowed over the course of the year, ending in the high 3 percent year-over-year growth range. Higher mortgage rates in the latter half of the year, combined with higher inventory levels, triggered the cooling trend. If similar conditions persist through 2025, we should expect very moderate price appreciation,\" said Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American. \"Areas with rapid supply growth that outstrips demand may face stronger moderation or even price declines, while areas with limited new supply may see steadier price growth or even price reacceleration. The structural housing shortage nationally will keep a floor on how low prices can go, but a \u2018higher-for-longer\u2019 rate environment and inventory growth could cause further price moderation.\" Year-Over-Year Price-Tier Data for the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Alpharetta Metro Area: December 2023 to December 2024 The First American Data & Analytics HPI segments home price changes at the metropolitan level into three price tiers based on local market sales data: starter tier, which represents home sales prices at the bottom third of the market price distribution; mid-tier, which represents home sales prices in the middle third of the market price distribution; and the luxury tier, which represents home sales prices in the top third of the market price distribution. Story Continues CBSA Starter Mid-Tier Luxury Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Alpharetta +1.3% +2.6% +6.0% \"House price growth has varied considerably at the regional level over the last year, largely driven by differences in for-sale inventories. As more homes become available, the power dynamics can shift in favor of buyers, putting downward pressure on prices,\" said Fleming. \"All else equal, house price growth in markets with higher inventory of homes available for sale will weaken compared to those with low inventory relative to demand.\" December 2024 First American Data & Analytics Price Tier HPI Highlights 2 Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) Ranked by Greatest Year-Over-Year Increases in Starter Tier HPI CBSA Change in Starter Tier HPI Change in Mid-Tier HPI Change in Luxury Tier HPI Pittsburgh +9.5 percent +2.7 percent +4.0 percent Cambridge, Mass. +6.0 percent +7.6 percent +6.8 percent New York +5.3 percent +5.2 percent +3.7 percent St. Louis +5.1 percent +2.9 percent +4.2 percent Anaheim, Calif. +5.0 percent +7.0 percent +6.6 percent Additional December 2024 First American Data & Analytics HPI Highlights Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) with Greatest Year-Over-Year Increases in HPI CBSA Change in HPI Anaheim, Calif. +6.1 percent Cambridge, Mass. +6.0 percent Pittsburgh +5.8 percent Las Vegas +4.4 percent Warren, Mich. +4.3 percent Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) with a Year-Over-Year Decease in HPI Tampa, Fla. -4.6 percent Oakland, Calif. -0.8 percent Austin, Texas -0.2 percent Los Angeles -0.1 percent San Antonio +0.5 percent HPI data for all 50 states and the largest 30 CBSAs by population is available here .

Next Release The next release of the First American Data & Analytics House Price Index will take place the week of February 17, 2025. First American Data & Analytics HPI Methodology The First American Data & Analytics HPI report measures single-family home prices, including distressed sales, with indices updated monthly beginning in 1980 through the month of the current report. HPI data is provided at the national, state and CBSA levels and includes preliminary index estimates for the month prior to the report (i.e. the preliminary result of July transactions is reported in August). The most recent index results are subject to revision as data from more transactions become available. The HPI uses a repeat-sales methodology, which measures price changes for the same property over time using more than 46 million paired transactions to generate the indices. In non-disclosure states, the HPI utilizes a combination of public sales records, MLS sold and active listings, and appraisal data to estimate house prices. This comprehensive approach is particularly effective in areas where there is limited availability of accurate sale prices, such as non-disclosure states. Property type, price and location data are used to create more refined market segment indices. Real Estate-Owned transactions are not included.

combined with higher inventory levels, triggered the cooling trend, says Chief Economist Mark Fleming\u2014 SANTA ANA, Calif., January 27, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- First American Data & Analytics , a leading national provider of property-centric information, risk management and valuation solutions and a division of First American Financial Corporation (NYSE: FAF), today released its December 2024 Home Price Index (HPI) report. The report tracks home price changes less than four weeks behind real time at the national, state and metropolitan (Core-Based Statistical Area) levels and includes metropolitan price tiers that segment sale transactions into starter, mid and luxury tiers. The full report can be found here . December 1 Home Price Index Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land Market Metric Change in HPI November-December 2024 (month over month) +0.2 percent December 2023-December 2024 (year over year) +2.1 percent National HPI Metric Change in HPI November-December 2024 (month over month) +0.1 percent December 2023-December 2024 (year over year) +3.9 percent Chief Economist National HPI Analysis: \"House price growth nationally started 2024 strong at a 7 percent annualized pace of growth but gradually slowed over the course of the year, ending in the high 3 percent year-over-year growth range. Higher mortgage rates in the latter half of the year, combined with higher inventory levels, triggered the cooling trend. If similar conditions persist through 2025, we should expect very moderate price appreciation,\" said Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American. \"Areas with rapid supply growth that outstrips demand may face stronger moderation or even price declines, while areas with limited new supply may see steadier price growth or even price reacceleration. The structural housing shortage nationally will keep a floor on how low prices can go, but a \u2018higher-for-longer\u2019 rate environment and inventory growth could cause further price moderation.\" Year-Over-Year Price-Tier Data for the Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land Metro Area: December 2023 to December 2024 The First American Data & Analytics HPI segments home price changes at the metropolitan level into three price tiers based on local market sales data: starter tier, which represents home sales prices at the bottom third of the market price distribution; mid-tier, which represents home sales prices in the middle third of the market price distribution; and the luxury tier, which represents home sales prices in the top third of the market price distribution. Story Continues CBSA Starter Mid-Tier Luxury Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land +0.7% +2.8% +4.1% \"House price growth has varied considerably at the regional level over the last year, largely driven by differences in for-sale inventories. As more homes become available, the power dynamics can shift in favor of buyers, putting downward pressure on prices,\" said Fleming. \"All else equal, house price growth in markets with higher inventory of homes available for sale will weaken compared to those with low inventory relative to demand.\" December 2024 First American Data & Analytics Price Tier HPI Highlights 2 Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) Ranked by Greatest Year-Over-Year Increases in Starter Tier HPI CBSA Change in Starter Tier HPI Change in Mid-Tier HPI Change in Luxury Tier HPI Pittsburgh +9.5 percent +2.7 percent +4.0 percent Cambridge, Mass. +6.0 percent +7.6 percent +6.8 percent New York +5.3 percent +5.2 percent +3.7 percent St. Louis +5.1 percent +2.9 percent +4.2 percent Anaheim, Calif. +5.0 percent +7.0 percent +6.6 percent Additional December 2024 First American Data & Analytics HPI Highlights Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) with Greatest Year-Over-Year Increases in HPI CBSA Change in HPI Anaheim, Calif. +6.1 percent Cambridge, Mass. +6.0 percent Pittsburgh +5.8 percent Las Vegas +4.4 percent Warren, Mich. +4.3 percent Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) with a Year-Over-Year Decease in HPI Tampa, Fla. -4.6 percent Oakland, Calif. -0.8 percent Austin, Texas -0.2 percent Los Angeles -0.1 percent San Antonio +0.5 percent HPI data for all 50 states and the largest 30 CBSAs by population is available here .

Next Release The next release of the First American Data & Analytics House Price Index will take place the week of February 17, 2025. First American Data & Analytics HPI Methodology The First American Data & Analytics HPI report measures single-family home prices, including distressed sales, with indices updated monthly beginning in 1980 through the month of the current report. HPI data is provided at the national, state and CBSA levels and includes preliminary index estimates for the month prior to the report (i.e. the preliminary result of July transactions is reported in August). The most recent index results are subject to revision as data from more transactions become available. The HPI uses a repeat-sales methodology, which measures price changes for the same property over time using more than 46 million paired transactions to generate the indices. In non-disclosure states, the HPI utilizes a combination of public sales records, MLS sold and active listings, and appraisal data to estimate house prices. This comprehensive approach is particularly effective in areas where there is limited availability of accurate sale prices, such as non-disclosure states. Property type, price and location data are used to create more refined market segment indices. Real Estate-Owned transactions are not included.

combined with higher inventory levels, triggered the cooling trend, says Chief Economist Mark Fleming\u2014 SANTA ANA, Calif., January 27, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- First American Data & Analytics , a leading national provider of property-centric information, risk management and valuation solutions and a division of First American Financial Corporation (NYSE: FAF), today released its December 2024 Home Price Index (HPI) report. The report tracks home price changes less than four weeks behind real time at the national, state and metropolitan (Core-Based Statistical Area) levels and includes metropolitan price tiers that segment sale transactions into starter, mid and luxury tiers. The full report can be found here . December 1 Home Price Index New York-Jersey City-White Plains Market Metric Change in HPI November-December 2024 (month over month) -1.6 percent December 2023-December 2024 (year over year) +3.5 percent National HPI Metric Change in HPI November-December 2024 (month over month) +0.1 percent December 2023-December 2024 (year over year) +3.9 percent Chief Economist National HPI Analysis: \"House price growth nationally started 2024 strong at a 7 percent annualized pace of growth but gradually slowed over the course of the year, ending in the high 3 percent year-over-year growth range. Higher mortgage rates in the latter half of the year, combined with higher inventory levels, triggered the cooling trend. If similar conditions persist through 2025, we should expect very moderate price appreciation,\" said Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American. \"Areas with rapid supply growth that outstrips demand may face stronger moderation or even price declines, while areas with limited new supply may see steadier price growth or even price reacceleration. The structural housing shortage nationally will keep a floor on how low prices can go, but a \u2018higher-for-longer\u2019 rate environment and inventory growth could cause further price moderation.\" Year-Over-Year Price-Tier Data for the New York-Jersey City-White Plains Metro Area: December 2023 to December 2024 The First American Data & Analytics HPI segments home price changes at the metropolitan level into three price tiers based on local market sales data: starter tier, which represents home sales prices at the bottom third of the market price distribution; mid-tier, which represents home sales prices in the middle third of the market price distribution; and the luxury tier, which represents home sales prices in the top third of the market price distribution. Story Continues CBSA Starter Mid-Tier Luxury New York-Jersey City-White Plains +5.3% +5.2% +3.7% \"House price growth has varied considerably at the regional level over the last year, largely driven by differences in for-sale inventories. As more homes become available, the power dynamics can shift in favor of buyers, putting downward pressure on prices,\" said Fleming. \"All else equal, house price growth in markets with higher inventory of homes available for sale will weaken compared to those with low inventory relative to demand.\" December 2024 First American Data & Analytics Price Tier HPI Highlights 2 Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) Ranked by Greatest Year-Over-Year Increases in Starter Tier HPI CBSA Change in Starter Tier HPI Change in Mid-Tier HPI Change in Luxury Tier HPI Pittsburgh +9.5 percent +2.7 percent +4.0 percent Cambridge, Mass. +6.0 percent +7.6 percent +6.8 percent New York +5.3 percent +5.2 percent +3.7 percent St. Louis +5.1 percent +2.9 percent +4.2 percent Anaheim, Calif. +5.0 percent +7.0 percent +6.6 percent Additional December 2024 First American Data & Analytics HPI Highlights Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) with Greatest Year-Over-Year Increases in HPI CBSA Change in HPI Anaheim, Calif. +6.1 percent Cambridge, Mass. +6.0 percent Pittsburgh +5.8 percent Las Vegas +4.4 percent Warren, Mich. +4.3 percent Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) with a Year-Over-Year Decease in HPI Tampa, Fla. -4.6 percent Oakland, Calif. -0.8 percent Austin, Texas -0.2 percent Los Angeles -0.1 percent San Antonio +0.5 percent HPI data for all 50 states and the largest 30 CBSAs by population is available here .

Next Release The next release of the First American Data & Analytics House Price Index will take place the week of February 17, 2025. First American Data & Analytics HPI Methodology The First American Data & Analytics HPI report measures single-family home prices, including distressed sales, with indices updated monthly beginning in 1980 through the month of the current report. HPI data is provided at the national, state and CBSA levels and includes preliminary index estimates for the month prior to the report (i.e. the preliminary result of July transactions is reported in August). The most recent index results are subject to revision as data from more transactions become available. The HPI uses a repeat-sales methodology, which measures price changes for the same property over time using more than 46 million paired transactions to generate the indices. In non-disclosure states, the HPI utilizes a combination of public sales records, MLS sold and active listings, and appraisal data to estimate house prices. This comprehensive approach is particularly effective in areas where there is limited availability of accurate sale prices, such as non-disclosure states. Property type, price and location data are used to create more refined market segment indices. Real Estate-Owned transactions are not included.

trend, says Chief Economist Mark Fleming\u2014 SANTA ANA, Calif., January 27, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- First American Data & Analytics , a leading national provider of property-centric information, risk management and valuation solutions and a division of First American Financial Corporation (NYSE: FAF), today released its December 2024 Home Price Index (HPI) report. The report tracks home price changes less than four weeks behind real time at the national, state and metropolitan (Core-Based Statistical Area) levels and includes metropolitan price tiers that segment sale transactions into starter, mid and luxury tiers. The full report can be found here . December 1 National House Price Index First American Data & Analytics\u2019 National Non-Seasonally Adjusted (NSA) HPI Metric Change in HPI November-December 2024 (month over month) +0.1 percent December 2023-December 2024 (year over year) +3.9 percent Highlights House prices nationally are now 54.8 percent higher compared to pre-pandemic levels (February 2020). House price decline reported in last month\u2019s HPI for October 2024 to November 2024 was revised down by 0.02 percentage points, from -0.01 percent to -0.03 percent. Chief Economist Analysis: \"House price growth nationally started 2024 strong at a 7 percent annualized pace of growth but gradually slowed over the course of the year, ending in the high 3 percent year-over-year growth range. Higher mortgage rates in the latter half of the year, combined with higher inventory levels, triggered the cooling trend. If similar conditions persist through 2025, we should expect very moderate price appreciation,\" said Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American. \"Areas with rapid supply growth that outstrips demand may face stronger moderation or even price declines, while areas with limited new supply may see steadier price growth or even price reacceleration. The structural housing shortage nationally will keep a floor on how low prices can go, but a \u2018higher-for-longer\u2019 rate environment and inventory growth could cause further price moderation.\" December 2024 Local Market Price Tier Highlights The First American Data & Analytics HPI segments home price changes at the metropolitan level into three price tiers based on local market sales data: starter tier, which represents home sales prices at the bottom third of the market price distribution; mid-tier, which represents home sales prices in the middle third of the market price distribution; and the luxury tier, which represents home sales prices in the top third of the market price distribution. Story Continues \"House price growth has varied considerably at the regional level over the last year, largely driven by differences in for-sale inventories. As more homes become available, the power dynamics can shift in favor of buyers, putting downward pressure on prices,\" said Fleming. \"All else equal, house price growth in markets with higher inventory of homes available for sale will weaken compared to those with low inventory relative to demand.\" December 2024 First American Data & Analytics Price Tier HPI Highlights 2 Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) Ranked by Greatest Year-Over-Year Increases in Starter Tier HPI CBSA Change in Starter Tier HPI Change in Mid-Tier HPI Change in Luxury Tier HPI Pittsburgh +9.5 percent +2.7 percent +4.0 percent Cambridge, Mass. +6.0 percent +7.6 percent +6.8 percent New York +5.3 percent +5.2 percent +3.7 percent St. Louis +5.1 percent +2.9 percent +4.2 percent Anaheim, Calif. +5.0 percent +7.0 percent +6.6 percent Additional December 2024 First American Data & Analytics HPI Highlights Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) with Greatest Year-Over-Year Increases in HPI CBSA Change in HPI Anaheim, Calif. +6.1 percent Cambridge, Mass. +6.0 percent Pittsburgh +5.8 percent Las Vegas +4.4 percent Warren, Mich. +4.3 percent Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) with a Year-Over-Year Decease in HPI Tampa, Fla. -4.6 percent Oakland, Calif. -0.8 percent Austin, Texas -0.2 percent Los Angeles -0.1 percent San Antonio +0.5 percent HPI data for all 50 states and the largest 30 CBSAs by population is available here .

Next Release The next release of the First American Data & Analytics House Price Index will take place the week of February 17, 2025. First American Data & Analytics HPI Methodology The First American Data & Analytics HPI report measures single-family home prices, including distressed sales, with indices updated monthly beginning in 1980 through the month of the current report. HPI data is provided at the national, state and CBSA levels and includes preliminary index estimates for the month prior to the report (i.e. the preliminary result of July transactions is reported in August). The most recent index results are subject to revision as data from more transactions become available. The HPI uses a repeat-sales methodology, which measures price changes for the same property over time using more than 46 million paired transactions to generate the indices. In non-disclosure states, the HPI utilizes a combination of public sales records, MLS sold and active listings, and appraisal data to estimate house prices. This comprehensive approach is particularly effective in areas where there is limited availability of accurate sale prices, such as non-disclosure states. Property type, price and location data are used to create more refined market segment indices. Real Estate-Owned transactions are not included.

In December 2024 , Galimedix Therapeutics announced the initiation of its Phase II eDREAM study to assess the safety and efficacy of GAL-101 eye drops in patients with dry age-related macular degeneration. In December 2024 , Ocugen, Inc. announced that the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for the OCU410 ArMaDa clinical trial recently convened and approved continuation of the second phase of the Phase 1/2 study. OCU410 (AAV5-hRORA) is a novel modifier gene therapy candidate being developed for geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to dry age-related macular degeneration (dAMD). In November 2024 , Ocugen, Inc. announced positive preliminary efficacy and safety data from the Phase I dose-escalation portion of the Phase 1/2 OCU410 ArMaDa clinical trial for geographic atrophy (GA), secondary to dry age-related macular degeneration (dAMD). Key findings include: no drug-related serious adverse events, reduced lesion growth, preservation of retinal tissue, and most importantly there was a positive effect on the functional visual measure of low luminance visual acuity (LLVA). In October 2024 , Eyestem Research, focused on creating scalable cell therapies for incurable diseases, had announced a positive outcome of the Drug Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) review for the first cohort of its Phase one trial to treat Geographic Atrophy secondary to Dry Age-related Macular Degeneration, marking a milestone for Indian science and medical research. In September 2024 , Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc. announced the presentation of new bevemipretide (SBT-272) preclinical data demonstrating topical ocular delivery to the retina with protective effects observed in models of AMD. In June 2024 , Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc. announced that it has enrolled and dosed its first patient in the ReNEW trial as part of its Phase III clinical program for elamipretide in patients with dry age-related macular degeneration (dry AMD). The program consists of the two Phase III trials, ReNEW and ReGAIN. Both trials will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of daily subcutaneous injections of elamipretide in participants with dry AMD. In April 2024 , \u00a0 Eyestem received approval from India's Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO) to commence human trials for Eyecyte RPE, a potential treatment for geographic atrophy arising from dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Story Continues Request a sample and discover the recent advances in dry AMD treatment drugs @ Dry Age-Related Macular Degeneration Pipeline Report The dry AMD pipeline report provides detailed profiles of pipeline assets, a comparative analysis of clinical and non-clinical stage dry AMD drugs, inactive and dormant assets, a comprehensive assessment of driving and restraining factors, and an assessment of opportunities and risks in the dry AMD clinical trial landscape. Dry Age-Related Macular Degeneration Overview Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the top four causes of blindness in older adults and the leading cause of irreversible blindness in developed countries. Around 170 million people globally are affected by AMD, making it the third most common cause of vision loss worldwide. Dry AMD typically progresses slowly, but wet AMD can cause severe visual impairment within days or weeks of onset. In the early stages of AMD, there are no noticeable symptoms, though an ophthalmologist can detect drusen before symptoms arise. Some individuals experience slight vision changes during the intermediate stage, but many remain symptom-free. Others may notice dark or grey spots in their central vision or have difficulty transitioning from bright to dim lighting. Clinicians currently use various imaging techniques to monitor changes in the retina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and choroid, including fundus exams, color fundus photography, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and infrared reflectance imaging. Over the past two decades, OCT has significantly advanced the early detection, monitoring, and treatment assessment of dry AMD. Modern spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) systems provide detailed cross-sectional and volumetric views of the retina, enabling clinicians to visualize, measure, and monitor retinal layers, RPE, hyperreflective foci, geographic atrophy (GA), and drusen. While SD-OCT remains the standard of care, emerging technologies like polarization-sensitive OCT (PS-OCT), which offers tissue-selective imaging, may revolutionize AMD research and clinical practices. Currently, no approved treatments exist for dry AMD. Management involves regular monitoring, timely detection of visual deterioration, appropriate rehabilitation, and early identification of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Research is underway to explore therapeutic strategies to prevent AMD, slow its progression, or restore vision. Potential treatments include lifestyle and behavioral changes, age-related eye disease study (AREDS) supplements, visual cycle modulators, anti-inflammatory agents, complement inhibitors, gene therapy, cell-based therapies, and approaches to reduce toxic by-products.

CVX +0.10% MRK +0.98% QCOM -1.56% CSPI -3.50% TRIP -1.65% Monday, January 20, 2025 The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Chevron Corporation (c), Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) and QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM), as well as two micro-cap stocks CSP Inc. (CSPI) and AMCON Distributing Company (DIT).\u00a0 The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.

A New U.S. Presidency Begins: Global Week Ahead Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard While no earnings releases are scheduled for today on account of the MLK Day holiday, the rest of this week will see more than 100 companies report Q4 results, including 36 S&P 500 members. With results from 42 S&P 500 as of Friday, January 17th, we will have seen results from roughly 15% of the index's membership by the end of this week. Total earnings for the 42 index members that have reported results already are up +21.8% from the same period last year on +7.3% higher revenues, with 81% beating EPS estimates and 71.4% beating revenue estimates. This is a notably better showing from this group of 42 index members relative to what we have seen from this same group in other recent periods, particularly on the growth front. Looking at Q4 as a whole, combining the actual results from the 42 index members with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings are expected to be up +8.5% on +4.8% higher revenues. Featured Analyst Reports Chevron shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past six months (+8.1% vs. +0.8%). The company is a fully integrated energy firm, Chevron is positioned as one of the top global integrated oil firms, set for sustainable production growth, particularly due to its dominant position in the lucrative Permian Basin. Further, the planned acquisition of Hess Corporation is expected to significantly strengthen Chevron's presence in oil-rich Guyana. However, the company is grappling with high sensitivity to oil price fluctuations and relatively expensive valuation. Another concern is the sub-100% reserve replacement ratio, indicating challenges in replenishing produced energy. Considering all these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.

The company is facing generic competition for several drugs, rising competitive pressure on diabetes franchise and declining Gardasil sales in China may hurt the top line. There are concerns about Merck\u2019s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda\u2019s loss of exclusivity in 2028. Estimates have declined ahead of Q4 results. Merck has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarter. Nevertheless, Blockbuster drug, Keytruda, and new products have been driving Merck\u2019s sales. With continued label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to see continued growth. Animal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline and is investing in M&A activity to strengthen its pipeline.

The company is increasingly focusing on the seamless transition from a wireless communications firm for the mobile industry to a connected processor firm for the intelligent edge. With the accelerated rollout of 5G technology, it is benefiting from investments toward building a licensing program in mobile. Qualcomm received a favorable verdict in a legal dispute against Arm Holdings, allowing the company to continue developing high-performing, best-in-class products based on Oryon ARM-compliant custom CPUs. However, it faces stiff competition in the mobile phone chipset market. The majority of its customers include Chinese manufacturers, which further clouds the revenue-generating potential, owing to strained bilateral trade relationships with the United States. The high debt burden is a concern. (You can read the full research report on QUALCOMM here >>> ) Shares of CSP have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry over the past year (+45.1% vs. +2.9%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $160.59 million have ended fiscal 2024 with $30.6 million in cash, up from $25.2 million, enabling growth investments like AZT PROTECT and high-margin services while maintaining a debt-free balance sheet. Recurring revenue rose to 17% of sales, driven by managed services and cloud solutions. AZT PROTECT gains traction via Rockwell partnerships and major contracts, enhancing cybersecurity market positioning. Niche expansions in cruise and freightliner markets diversify revenue. Strategic shifts to high-margin offerings improve profitability, supported by partnerships and industry awards.

Zacks Equity Research Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 8:10 PM 3 min read In This Article: FAF -0.76% Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? First American Financial (FAF), which belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry, could be a great candidate to consider. This financial services company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 14.46%. For the most recent quarter, First American Financial was expected to post earnings of $1.15 per share, but it reported $1.34 per share instead, representing a surprise of 16.52%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.13 per share, while it actually produced $1.27 per share, a surprise of 12.39%. For First American Financial, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank. Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. First American Financial has an Earnings ESP of +4.89% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on February 12, 2025. When the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss. Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate. Story Continues Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

GlobalData Fri, Jan 10, 2025, 1:55 PM 2 min read The Financial Accounting Foundation (FAF) Board of Trustees is soliciting nominations for various leadership positions. These include the chair and members of the Board of Trustees, the executive director of FAF, a member of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), and the chair of the Financial Accounting Standards Advisory Council (FASAC). While initiating the search for these roles, the FAF Board of Trustees Appointments Committee is prioritising diversity in experience and background to ensure a range of perspectives within the Boards and Councils. The incoming chair will serve a three-year term from 1 January 2026 to 31 December 2028, with eligibility for reappointment for a subsequent term commencing in 2029. It will lead strategic decision-making, overseeing appointments, governance, and represent the FAF to stakeholders and regulators. The FAF Board of Trustees provides oversight and support to both the FASB and the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB), while the standard-setting Boards independently handle technical decisions on financial accounting and reporting standards. The FAF is also looking to appoint several \u201cat-large\u201d Trustees. These individuals will bring expertise from various sectors such as business, investment, capital markets, academia, finance, government, and regulation to contribute towards the Foundation's objectives. The executive director of the FAF will head a team of approximately 45 professionals, delivering support services to the FASB and GASB, encompassing areas such as communications, legal, IT, human resources, and financial management. In partnership with the FAF chair, the executive director will devise and implement outreach strategies to foster relationships with crucial stakeholders domestically and internationally. The FASB member role, based in Norwalk, Connecticut, is a full-time position with a start date of 1 July 2026. The appointed member will be expected to begin earlier in the year to facilitate a smooth transition. The initial term lasts five years, ending on 30 June 2031, with the possibility of reappointment. Members work collaboratively to develop financial reporting standards that provide information to investors and other financial statement users. Lastly, the FASAC chair will lead advisory efforts to the FASB, guiding discussions on agenda items, priorities, procedural issues, and other relevant topics. This role ensures that the views of FASAC members are effectively communicated to both the FASB and FASAC. The term for the FASAC chair can last up to four years or a shorter duration as agreed upon at the time of appointment, with potential for reappointment.

Clinical Trial of its First-in-Class Dual Inflammasome Inhibitor, K8, in Geographic Atrophy, Demonstrating Rapid, Substantial and Significant Efficacy and Safety Business Wire Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 3:31 PM 5 min read In a U.S. clinical trial of 5 patients with bilateral GA, sustained-release intravitreous implants of K8 were well tolerated, with no drug-related ocular or systemic serious adverse events. In each of the 5 patients, eyes treated with the K8 implant displayed rapid and substantial reduction of GA lesion growth compared to their contralateral untreated eyes. The mean lesion growth in K8-treated eyes was 66% less than that of untreated contralateral eyes at 3 months after a single implant injection, (p value=0.029), as assessed by an independent masked reading center. K8 is a first-in-class dual inflammasome inhibitor that targets multiple GA disease pathways via a novel mechanism of action. An expanded 30-patient trial is underway. NEWTON, Mass., January 15, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Inflammasome Therapeutics ( https://www.inflam.com/ ), a clinical-stage biotech company developing novel, first-in-class dual inflammasome inhibitors for prevalent ophthalmic and neurodegenerative diseases, today announced positive topline 3-month data from a clinical trial of its K8 implant in patients with geographic atrophy (GA), the most serious form of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Positive efficacy and safety data were observed at 3 months after a single injection of K8 in this study conducted at the University of Kentucky (NCT06164587). In the 5 patients with bilateral GA who received a K8 implant in one eye, there was a mean reduction in GA lesion growth of 66% at 3 months compared to the untreated contralateral eyes with GA (p = 0.029, mixed effects model), as measured by fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging by an independent masked reading center. Also, in all 5 patients, the GA lesions progressed at a much slower rate in the K8-treated eyes compared to the contralateral eyes. No drug-related intraocular or systemic safety issues were identified, and patients will receive a second K8 injection at month 3 of this 6-month trial. Given the extremely positive efficacy and safety data, the trial has now been expanded to 30 patients (60 eyes). \"We are excited to see such rapid and dramatic reduction of GA lesion growth within only 3 months following a single injection,\" said Jayakrishna Ambati, M.D. , co-founder of Inflammasome Therapeutics. \"Natural history studies have shown that in bilateral GA patients the lesion growth rates in the two eyes are almost identical, with less than 5% difference between eyes. Therefore, a 66% reduction in K8-treated eyes compared to contralateral eyes of the same patients provides strong evidence of efficacy. K8 has a unique mechanism of action whereby it blocks the effects of complement activation as well as numerous other inflammatory pathways in GA, a multifactorial disease. The rapid, profound, and uniform clinical efficacy seen in all 5 patients in this trial is consistent with the extensive preclinical data showing this multipronged protective action of K8. Remarkably, lesion growth was reduced irrespective of the FAF pattern, whether the lesions were fast- or slow-growing, location or duration of disease, or type of AMD drusen, demonstrating the broad-based action of K8,\" continued Dr. Ambati. Story Continues \"These initial clinical trial results are extremely encouraging, and we look forward to follow-up data from additional patients,\" said Paul Ashton, Ph.D., CEO and co-founder of Inflammasome Therapeutics. \"We are delighted that a single injection of K8 delivered via our unique drug-delivery technology achieved substantial and rapid efficacy that is much greater and faster than the approximate 20% reduction reported for the two FDA-approved drugs with monthly injections after 12 months. Furthermore, we believe that the statistical significance of the 66% reduction in lesion growth of 66% (p=0.029) compared to the untreated eyes seen with only 5 patients is indicative of the drug\u2019s robust effect. Thus, K8 may present an opportunity to break through the efficacy ceiling observed with the approved anti-complement drugs in GA,\" continued Dr. Ashton. The next phase of this 6-month trial will further evaluate safety and efficacy of K8 injected every 3 months in up to 30 participants with GA. The primary endpoints are safety and the difference in GA lesion growth in treated eyes versus contralateral untreated eyes. About Inflammasome Therapeutics and Kamuvudines Inflammasome Therapeutics ( https://www.inflam.com/ ) is a private, clinical-stage, biotech company developing novel, first-in-class, dual inflammasome inhibitors known as Kamuvudines for multiple ocular and neurological diseases. K8, delivered via a sustained-release intravitreous implant, is the Company\u2019s lead product for retinal diseases such as GA. K8 has a unique, differentiated mechanism of action that enables it to block multiple toxic pathways that drive GA. GA affects approximately one million individuals in the US and more than eight million worldwide. In GA, multiple toxic substances including complement, retrotransposons, amyloid \u03b2 , iron, and reactive oxygen species accumulate in the eye and trigger inflammasome activation as a final common pathway, which then causes cells in the macula to slowly die (atrophy). Over time, the area of atrophy grows in size and can lead to vision loss. The two currently FDA-approved drugs each target just a single toxic substance in the complement pathway but not the many other toxic substances seen in GA. They only modestly slow progression of GA, do not appear to slow down the rate of vision loss, and are associated with increased risk of developing wet AMD. The global annual market for GA has been estimated by Precision Business Insights to exceed $30 billion, and there is tremendous interest in developing new GA therapies. There are 40 interventional clinical trials for GA registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, almost all of which target individual toxic substances. In contrast, K8 blocks inflammasome activation caused by multiple toxic substances that accumulate in GA. Inflammasome Therapeutics believes this differentiated mechanism of action targeting the final common pathway could lead to improved, best-in-disease efficacy. Kamuvudines could also have application in a wide variety of neuro-inflammatory diseases such as ALS, Parkinson\u2019s disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and Multiple Sclerosis. \"Preclinical data show impressive efficacy of Kamuvudine K9 in multiple neurodegeneration models,\" said Dr, Ambati. Oral K9 is currently being tested in a clinical trial in subjects with Thyroid Eye Disease (NCT06467435). \"We have Kamuvudines specifically designed for neurological diseases that penetrate into the brain and central nervous system from a simple oral tablet. Inflammasome Therapeutics expects to begin clinical trials in some neurodegenerative diseases soon as well,\" Dr. Ashton said. Dr. Ambati has spent more than a decade developing Kamuvudines and identifying their role in the inhibition of inflammasome activity that is now recognized to be the critical driving force of many chronic diseases. In a series of publications in journals such as Science and Nature , his group has described the basic research on GA and preclinical development of Kamuvudines: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1261754 https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09830 https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abj3658 https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciimmunol.abi4493 Please visit www.inflam.com to learn more.
