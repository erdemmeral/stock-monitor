Tech (NASDAQ:TTEK) Vs The Rest Adam Hejl Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 12:07 PM 5 min read In This Article: TTEK -7.04% ARIS +0.78% PESI -3.71% Environmental and Facilities Services Stocks Q3 Teardown: Tetra Tech (NASDAQ:TTEK) Vs The Rest The end of an earnings season can be a great time to discover new stocks and assess how companies are handling the current business environment. Let\u2019s take a look at how Tetra Tech (NASDAQ:TTEK) and the rest of the environmental and facilities services stocks fared in Q3. Many environmental and facility services are non-discretionary (sports stadiums need to be cleaned after events), recurring, and performed through longer-term contracts. This makes for more predictable and stickier revenue streams. Additionally, there has been an increasing focus on emissions and water conservation over the last decade, driving innovation in the sector and demand for new services. Despite these tailwinds, environmental and facility services companies are still at the whim of economic cycles. Interest rates, for example, can greatly impact commercial construction projects that drive incremental demand for these services. The 14 environmental and facilities services stocks we track reported a slower Q3. As a group, revenues were in line with analysts\u2019 consensus estimates while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 1.7% above. While some environmental and facilities services stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they have collectively declined. On average, share prices are down 2.9% since the latest earnings results.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Strong Momentum Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

M. Smucker (SJM) Can\u2019t \u2018Overrun Sentiment\u2019 Amid Weight Loss Drugs Threat Fahad Saleem Sun, Jan 26, 2025, 8:18 PM 4 min read In this article: SJM -0.94% We recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Calls: 10 Stocks to Buy or Sell . In this article, we are going to take a look at where The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM) stands against other stocks to buy and sell highlighted in Jim Cramer's latest calls. Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC reminded viewers about the Trump playbook in the story market and said that he never believed the President would start a new trade war with China. Cramer explained that Trump\u2019s rhetoric has been \u201chot\u201d but the reality is \u201ccool\u201d and his much-feared tariffs against Canada and Mexico might also not realize as the new administration said it will \u201cstudy\u201d the matter. \u201cThe president loves the stock market; he always loves to send signals that all hell is going to break loose, and when it doesn\u2019t, well, guess what? The market flies. This rally is built on the back of tariffs, more specifically small-than-expected tariffs that could grow bigger if countries don\u2019t play ball. It\u2019s built on the backs of new projects like Stargate, a new AI infrastructure initiative.\u201d Cramer then explained in detail why he believes Biden and his government were against top companies and how it affected the market and economy. Cramer said Trump is better for stock portfolios. \u201cHe knows business people in Silicon Valley; he knows how things work. You may like him, you may hate him, but the bottom line is, if you\u2019re a tech titan, Trump will take your call. In fact, he\u2019ll call you. Biden, I don\u2019t know if he knew who they even were, and he certainly didn\u2019t bother to call them. In the end, I think he preferred to sue them. If you own stocks, which is why you watch me, Trump\u2019s method is a heck of a lot better for your portfolio.\u201d READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about during his programs on CNBC. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ( see more details here ). Jim Cramer Says J M Smucker (SJM) Can\u2019t \u2018Overrun Sentiment\u2019 Amid Weight Loss Drugs Threat A wholesaler distributing peanut butter, fruit spreads and specialty spreads to a retailer. The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE: SJM ) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 30 Jim Cramer in a latest program mentioned an analyst downgrade on The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM) and reiterated that he believes GLP-1 weight loss drugs are having an impact on investor sentiment. Story continues \u201cThe stock is getting hurt on this. It\u2019s part of what I regard as being a reshuffling of this group. Once again, GLP-1. It does yield 4%. Very well-run company, but you can\u2019t , you can\u2019t overrun the sentiment right now. You just can\u2019t.\u201d Middle Coast Investing stated the following regarding The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM) in its Q4 2024 investor letter : \u201cI\u2019ve been interested in \u2018boring\u2019 companies that should do well whatever the market environment, and that have strong balance sheets in case things turn badly. ABM Inc. (ABM) from last quarter, Steelcase, or The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM) are examples of these types of companies. SJM has more debt on its balance sheet, but I believe its business will be stable enough for it to pay off the debt, creating more value for shareholders.\u201d Overall, SJM ranks 8th on our list of stocks to buy and sell highlighted in Jim Cramer's latest calls. While we acknowledge the potential of SJM, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SJM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock .
