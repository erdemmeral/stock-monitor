[{"text": "Why You Shouldn't Hesitate to Buy These Top Stocks in 2025 Matt DiLallo, The Motley Fool Sat, Jan 25, 2025, 12:12 PM 5 min read In This Article: O +0.21% BIP-PA -0.72% There's a mantra in investing that says, \"Past performance doesn't guarantee future results.\" However, looking into the past returns of certain types of stocks can provide hints at what might drive future performance. One data point that investors won't want to overlook is the total returns produced by dividend-paying stocks compared to non-payers. Over the last 50 years, dividend stocks have outperformed non-payers by more than 2-to-1 (9.2% average annual total return versus 4.3%, according to data from Ned Davis Research and Hartford Funds). The data also shows that there has been a massive gap between companies that can grow their dividends and those that can't (10.2% return from dividend growers, 6.7% for maintainers, and - 0.6% for cutters and eliminators). Given that difference, investors should focus on owning companies that can grow their dividends. Here are a couple of top dividend stocks that investors shouldn't hesitate to buy in 2025. They're well positioned to continue producing above-average total returns in the future. Realty Income Realty Income (NYSE: O) has been a dividend growth juggernaut since coming public 30 years ago. The real estate investment trust ( REIT ) has increased its payout 128 times during that period, including every year and for the last 109 quarters in a row . It has grown its payout at a 4.2% compound annual rate, which has helped it produce a 14.1% compound annual total return since it came public. As noted, past performance alone doesn't guarantee Realty Income will continue increasing its dividend in the future. However, the REIT is in an excellent position to keep pushing its payout higher . Several factors drive that view. A big driver is the REIT's resilient real estate portfolio. It owns about 15,500 retail, industrial, gaming, and other properties net leased to many of the world's top companies . Net leases provide it with very stable rental income (tenants cover all operating expenses, including building insurance, real estate taxes, and routine maintenance) that steadily rises each year . Meanwhile, the REIT pays out a conservative percentage of its stable cash flow in dividends (75% of its adjusted funds from operations , or FFO). That enables it to retain a meaningful amount of cash to fund new investments. Realty Income estimates that its internal growth drivers will add about 2% to its FFO per share each year . On top of that, the REIT has an elite balance sheet, giving it ample financial flexibility to externally fund additional investments . It also recently launched a private fund management platform , which will enhance its access to capital and investment returns. These drivers should enable the REIT to continue growing its adjusted FFO at a mid-single-digit rate, which should support a steadily rising dividend. Story Continues With its dividend currently yielding around 6% and its earnings growing at a mid-single-digit rate, Realty Income could easily deliver double-digit total annual returns in the future . Brookfield Infrastructure Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC) (NYSE: BIP) has grown its dividend at a 9% compound annual rate since 2009 (right around its formation). That has helped fuel 13.3% total annual returns since it came public. The diversified global infrastructure operator (utilities, energy midstream, transportation, and data) is in an excellent position to continue growing its payout in the future (it's targeting 5% to 9% annual growth). Like Realty Income, it generates very stable cash flow. Long-term contracts or regulated rate structures supply 85% of its FFO, with that same percentage also either protected from or indexed to inflation. The company estimates that inflation escalators alone will add 3% to 4% to its FFO per share each year. Brookfield Infrastructure also has a conservative dividend payout ratio (60%-70% of its FFO) and a strong investment-grade balance sheet. Those features give it a lot of financial flexibility to invest in organic expansion projects and make accretive acquisitions. The company currently has about $8 billion in capital projects in its backlog that it expects to complete over the next two to three years. The bulk of its investments are for new semiconductor manufacturing facilities and data centers. Brookfield Infrastructure sees a lot of growth beyond its secured projects due to the enormous investment needed to maintain, upgrade, and build infrastructure around the world in the coming years. The company currently has over $4 billion in additional expansion projects under development and a rich pipeline of acquisition opportunities. These factors drive the company's view that it should be able to grow its FFO by more than 10% annually in the coming years. With its dividend currently yielding around 4% and earnings growing by more than 10% annually, Brookfield Infrastructure could have the fuel to produce total annualized returns in the mid-teens. Great dividend growth stocks Dividend growth stocks have historically produced the best total returns over the long term. That has certainly been the case with Realty Income and Brookfield Infrastructure, which have delivered strong returns for investors thanks to their steadily rising dividends. They're in an excellent position to continue growing their payouts in the future. Because of that, investors shouldn't hesitate to add them to their portfolios this year.

+0.49% BIP-PA -0.72% It takes money to make money. However, it might not take as much as you think. Many top-notch dividend stocks cost less than $100 per share. Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC) (NYSE: BIP) , Realty Income (NYSE: O) , and NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) are three of the top options under that price point. Here's what makes them great stocks to buy in 2025 for those with a little bit of cash to invest. Ample growth ahead Brookfield Infrastructure stock currently trades at around $40 per share. At that rate, investors could lock in a dividend yield right above 4%, several times higher than the broader market's average (the S&P 500 yields around 1.2%). The diversified global infrastructure company (utilities, energy midstream, transportation, and data) has done an excellent job growing its dividend over the years. Last year was its 15th straight year of dividend growth (every year since its formation). It has increased its payout at a 9% compound annual rate during that time. Brookfield is in a strong position to continue increasing its payout. It generates a very stable cash flow (85% is contracted or regulated) and pays out a conservative percentage of that money in dividends (60% to 70% of its funds from operations [FFO] annually). It retains the rest to help fund expansion projects. It currently has over $8 billion of projects in its backlog, which helps drive its view that it can grow its FFO per share by more than 10% per year , supporting its expectation that it can deliver 5% to 9% annual dividend growth. The steady growth should continue Shares of Realty Income currently cost around $55 apiece. The real estate investment trust (REIT) yields nearly 6% at that level. The company has done a fantastic job increasing its dividend. It has raised its payout every year since 1994, including the last 109 quarters in a row. Overall, it has delivered 4.2% compound annual dividend growth over the past three decades. Realty Income's high-yielding dividend is on a very solid foundation. It owns a diversified portfolio of properties net leased to many of the world's top companies , providing it with very stable rental income. It pays out about 75% of its steady income in dividends, retaining the rest to invest in additional income-generating properties. Realty Income also has one of the top balance sheets in the REIT sector. The REIT believes it can grow its adjusted FFO per share by a mid-single-digit annual rate in the future. Growth drivers include rental increases, new property acquisitions, and management income from its recently launched private fund platform . Realty Income has a very long growth runway, given that trillions of dollars in commercial real estate across the U.S. and Europe are suitable for the net lease structure. Story Continues A powerful growth tailwind NextEra Energy's stock price is a bit above $70 these days. At that level, the utility offers a nearly 3% dividend yield. The energy company has also increased its payment annually for the past three decades and grown its dividend at around a 10% compound annual rate over the past 20 years. The utility currently plans to grow its dividend by around 10% per year through at least 2026. Its lower dividend payout ratio (59% at the end of 2023, below the 65% average of its peers) and earnings growth outlook drive that expectation. NextEra Energy believes it can deliver adjusted earnings-per-share growth at or near the top end of its 6% to 8% annual target range through 2027 while maintaining its strong balance sheet. Renewable energy is a big factor powering NextEra Energy's growth outlook. Forecasts estimate that U.S. power demand will accelerate over the next 20 years, growing six times faster than the previous two decades. That should drive robust demand for renewables, with estimates suggesting the U.S. could deploy three times the renewable energy capacity over the next seven years as the country did over the last seven years. As a leader in developing renewable energy, NextEra Energy should capture a meaningful portion of this accelerating demand growth. Top-tier dividend stocks Brookfield Infrastructure, Realty Income, and NextEra Energy offer higher-yielding dividends backed by rock-solid financial profiles. They also have excellent records of increasing their dividends, which should continue. Add in their low share prices, and they're great dividend stocks to buy this year, especially for those with only a little bit of spare cash they want to invest.

Year (and Should Supply Even More in 2025) Matt DiLallo, The Motley Fool Sat, Jan 18, 2025, 3:29 PM 5 min read In This Article: ET-PI -1.27% BEP -4.34% BIP-PA -0.72% EPD +1.47% I own a lot of dividend stocks. They're a big part of my investment strategy. I'm working toward eventually generating enough passive income to cover my basic living expenses. Last year, five stocks supplied me with more than $500 of dividend income apiece . Here's a look at these leaders, which I expect will provide me with even more passive income in 2025. Energy Transfer Last year, Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET) was my top income-producing stock. The master limited partnership (MLP) pays a lucrative quarterly cash distribution. It currently yields nearly 6.5%, though the yield on my investment is even higher (over 12%) due to a lower purchase price and steady distribution increases. The midstream company raised its payout every quarter last year, increasing it by more than 3%. I expect Energy Transfer will remain one of my top income-producing investments in 2025. While I don't currently plan to add to my position at this time , I anticipate that the MLP will continue to steadily increase its distribution (it's targeting 3% to 5% annual growth). It can easily afford to continue raising its distribution due to its low payout ratio (slightly more than 50% of its stable cash flow), strong balance sheet, and growing earnings (accretive acquisition of WTG Midstream last year and a solid backlog of organic expansion projects). Those factors are why it will remain a core income investment in my portfolio for years to come . Brookfield Renewable Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC) (NYSE: BEP) was my second-largest dividend payer last year. That was due to the renewable energy stock's high yield (currently 5.5%, though my yield is around 9% due to a lower purchase price and a steadily rising dividend). The top renewable energy dividend stock has increased its payout at a 6% compound annual rate over the last two decades. That dividend rise should continue, given the company's stated plans of increasing its payout by 5% to 9% annually over the long term. With a strong balance sheet and robust growth profile, it should have plenty of power to achieve that target. Brookfield Renewable expects to boost its funds from operations ( FFO ) at a more than 10% annual rate over the next five years. It has several growth catalysts, including inflation-driven rate increases, development projects, and accretive acquisitions. Brookfield Infrastructure Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC) (NYSE: BIP) , the infrastructure-focused sibling of Brookfield Renewable, came in just behind its sibling. My current yield is more than 7.5% (compared to over 4% at the current share price) due to my lower cost basis and the company's steady dividend growth. Story Continues The globally diversified infrastructure operator (utilities, energy midstream, transportation, and data) has increased its payout at a 9% annual rate since its formation 15 years ago. Like its renewable energy sibling, Brookfield Infrastructure aims to raise its payout at a 5% to 9% annual rate. It has ample fuel to achieve that target thanks to its strong balance sheet and growth profile. It's also aiming to deliver about 10% annual hikes in FFO per share, powered by inflation-driven rate increases, development projects (primarily data infrastructure like data centers and semiconductor fabrication facilities), and mergers and acquisitions. Enterprise Products Partners Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) has been a very reliable income producer for me over the years . The MLP continues to steadily increase its lucrative distribution (nearly 6.5% current yield and 10.5% on my cost basis). It delivered its 26th straight year of growing the payout in 2024, a trend it has already continued in 2025 . The MLP has ample resources to continue raising its distribution. It has an elite balance sheet (with the highest credit rating in the energy midstream sector). It also has ample growth coming down the pipeline. Management closed its highly accretive acquisition of Pi\u00f1on Midstream late last year. Enterprise Products Partners also has $6.9 billion of major growth capital projects under construction that should enter service by the end of 2026. Kinder Morgan Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI) rounds out my top five. The natural gas pipeline stock\u00a0currently yields around 4%, though the figure on my cost basis is closer to 7%. It has increased its payment for seven straight years. The company has already announced plans to raise its dividend by another 2% this year. Thanks to its strong balance sheet and steadily rising cash flows, it can easily afford to do that. The company recently used its balance-sheet capacity to make an accretive acquisition , which will help further support its rising dividend. Meanwhile, it has a growing pipeline of expansion projects . It sees a robust opportunity to expand in the coming years, fueled by increasing demand for natural gas from emerging catalysts like AI data centers. These growth drivers should give it plenty of fuel to continue raising its dividend in the future. High-octane dividend stocks I've capitalized on opportunities to invest in higher-yielding energy stocks in recent years when prices were lower. That strategy has paid off, and the sector now supplies me with a lot of dividend income. I expect that income will grow this year as these companies increase their payouts. While I'm very comfortable with my top dividend payers, I'm currently working to diversify the top end of my income portfolio by increasing my dividends from non-energy stocks like REITs . Because of that, my top five could look a little different by the end of this year. Should you invest $1,000 in Energy Transfer right now?

DiLallo, Neha Chamaria, and Reuben Gregg Brewer, The Motley Fool Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 5:05 AM 5 min read In This Article: BEP -4.34% BIP-PA -0.72% BKH +0.49% High-yield dividend stocks can make great investments. They provide investors with a solid base return via their dividend income. Because of that, they don't have to grow that fast to produce an attractive total return. They also tend to be less volatile investments. Black Hills (NYSE: BKH) , Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC) (NYSE: BEP) , and Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC) (NYSE: BIP) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors as no-brainer high-yield dividend stocks to buy this year. Here's what makes them look like such smart investments for 2025 and beyond. Black Hills is a boring utility with a historically high yield Reuben Gregg Brewer (Black Hills): As 2025 gets underway, Black Hills is offering investors a 4.5% dividend yield. That's toward the high end of the electric and gas utility's historical yield range over the past decade. This suggests the stock is on sale right now. That yield also happens to be well above the 2.7% yield of the average utility. BKH Dividend Yield data by YCharts . What's even more attractive is that Black Hills has an investment-grade rated balance sheet. A capital investment plan of $4.3 billion over the next five years, with potential upside in the out years. And management expects to be able to grow earnings at roughly 4% to 6% a year for the foreseeable future. The dividend, meanwhile, is likely to grow in line with the utility's earnings over time. Add 5% to 4.5%, and you get 9.5%, which is very close to the historical total return investors expect from the broader market. And all this from one of the few utilities to have achieved Dividend King status, thanks to its 54-year history of annual dividend increases. Black Hills is a boring company that's a little off the radar of most investors. But if you are looking for a reliable, high-yield stock to buy to start the new year, you should do a deep dive today. A powerful combination Matt DiLallo (Brookfield Renewable ): Brookfield Renewable generates lots of stable cash flow by selling renewable power to utilities and large corporate buyers under long-term, fixed-rate power purchase agreements (PPAs). That gives it the cash to pay a very lucrative dividend. At around 5.2%, its dividend yield is several times higher than the S&P 500 's (currently about 1.2% ). The company has grown its payout at a 6% compound annual rate over the last 20 years. That trend should continue, with Brookfield targeting 5% to 9% annual dividend growth. Brookfield should have ample fuel to achieve that target. It's benefiting from accelerating demand for renewable energy, driven by falling costs, net-zero targets, and catalysts like artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. That's pushing up power prices while driving demand for additional capacity. Story Continues The company believes its existing portfolio will deliver 4% to 7% annual funds from operations (FFO) per share growth from inflation-linked rate increases and margin enhancement activities, like securing higher market power prices when legacy PPAs expire. In addition, Brookfield has an enormous backlog of renewable energy projects in the pipeline (about 200 gigawatts [GW]). It expects to commission about 10 GW of projects annually, which should drive another 4% to 6% growth in its FFO per share. On top of all that, the company expects to continue completing accretive mergers and acquisitions ( it's currently evaluating over $100 billion of acquisition opportunities). Add it all up, and Brookfield believes it can grow its FFO per share by more than 10% annually for the next several years. That combination of a high dividend yield and high growth rate could enable Brookfield Renewable to produce powerful total returns. Those features make it look like a no-brainer buy for income and upside potential. A great income and growth combination Neha Chamaria ( Brookfield Infrastructure): Formed in 2008, Brookfield Infrastructure is one of the world's largest owners and operators of infrastructure assets today, spread across utilities, transport, midstream energy, and data infrastructure. The company, which is the infrastructure-focused sibling of Brookfield Renewable, has also turned out to be a rock-solid dividend stock, raising its dividend payout every year since 2009 and growing it by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR)\u00a0of 9% through 2024. For income investors, there are solid reasons to buy Brookfield Infrastructure stock in 2025, and it isn't just about its dividend track record. Brookfield Infrastructure grew its FFO per unit by 7% during the nine months that ended Sept. 30, 2024, paving the way for another strong year for the company. In terms of investment, 2024 was also a strong year for Brookfield Infrastructure. Key moves included acquiring 76,000 telecom tower sites in India, a stake in a Brazilian rail and ports logistics company, and data centers in North America. The infrastructure giant's backlog is at record highs, and it appears well positioned to exploit megatrends, like digitalization, while earning toll-like income from its existing businesses, such as utilities and pipelines. Backed by a growing backlog, Brookfield Infrastructure is targeting 5% to 9% annual dividend per share growth. With the stock (BIPC) yielding 4% -- and units of the partnership (BIP) yielding 4.9% -- Brookfield Infrastructure is a no-brainer buy.
