GlobalData Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 4:57 PM 2 min read The accountancy sector is facing a growing challenge with an almost 20% rise in burnout symptoms reported by chartered accountants, according to recent research by caba. The findings underscored the urgency for enhanced support systems to address the mental and physical health concerns of professionals in the field. caba chief executive Cristian Holmes stressed the importance of workplace awareness in managing burnout, saying, \"While there are many things we can do to manage our own feelings of burnout, fostering awareness in the workplace is a crucial step in supporting employees with feelings of burnout.\" In 2024, 43% of accountants \u201cconstantly or often\u201d faced burnout indicators, the report said. This figure in the same year rose to 74% when adding accountants who \u2018sometimes\u2019 faced these symptoms. The report found that accountants are more than 36% more likely to report feeling stressed or burnt out compared to employees in other industries. Furthermore, one in three accountants have been diagnosed with or self-identify with depression, and three in ten have regular panic attacks. Physical symptoms such as headaches, sleep disturbances and gastrointestinal issues, are said to be indicators of burnt out. These along with emotional fatigue, can strain professional relationships and exacerbate burnout. More than two-thirds (63%) of accountants said their current work environment contributed to their burnout. Caba outlined various measures to support those struggling with burnout, including fostering open communication, promoting work-life balance, and providing accessible resources. Promoting work-life balance is crucial, urging employees to take regular breaks and vacations to recharge, improving both well-being and productivity. Additionally, companies can integrate burnout solutions into their culture, not just rely on standalone wellness programmes. \"20% rise in burnout symptoms among chartered accountants\" was originally created and published by International Accounting Bulletin , a GlobalData owned brand.

(Nasdaq: CABA), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and launching the first curative targeted cell therapies designed specifically for patients with autoimmune diseases, today announced recent pipeline and operational progress and outlined its strategic priorities and anticipated key milestones for 2025. \u201cOur clinical execution in 2024 allowed us to accelerate timelines for registrational discussions and demonstrate the potential of rese-cel to deliver immunosuppressant-free, compelling clinical responses in patients with active, refractory autoimmune disease. During the first half of 2025, our top priorities are clinical execution and achieving alignment with the FDA on the registrational pathway for rese-cel based on rapidly emerging clinical and translational data,\u201d said Steven Nichtberger, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Cabaletta. \u201cLeveraging a large and growing clinical site footprint in the U.S., recent expansion into Europe and an increased pace of patient enrollment observed across the RESET\u2122 clinical development program since our presentations at ACR Convergence in November 2024, we look forward to building on our momentum as we move closer to realizing our vision of launching the first targeted curative cell therapy designed specifically for patients with autoimmune disease.\u201d Recent Pipeline and Operational Progress As of December 31, 2024, 21 patients have been enrolled across 44 actively recruiting clinical sites in the U.S. and Europe across the RESET clinical development program. In the first 10 patients dosed with rese-cel with at least one month of follow-up, 90% have experienced either no cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or grade 1 (fever) CRS and 90% have experienced no immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Data from these patients will be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting in February 2025. Today, Cabaletta announced the following progress in support of its commitment to advance innovations that improve the patient and physician experience, in addition to broadening the potential of rese-cel for patients: The first patient has been enrolled in the RESET-PV trial, evaluating rese-cel without preconditioning in patients with pemphigus vulgaris. The first juvenile myositis clinical site in the RESET-Myositis trial is now open and actively recruiting. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) previously granted Rare Pediatric Disease designation for rese-cel in juvenile dermatomyositis. The first patient has been enrolled in the RESET-MG\u2122 trial, evaluating rese-cel in patients with myasthenia gravis. The Investigational New Drug (IND) application for rese-cel has been allowed to proceed within the routine 30-day window by the FDA for the RESET-MS trial, a Phase 1/2 study evaluating rese-cel in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). In addition, the FDA has granted Fast Track Designation to rese-cel for the treatment of relapsing and progressive forms of MS. In order to expand our clinical supply to address the increasing pace of enrollment in our clinical trials as well as to prepare for registrational trial(s) across the RESET clinical development program while expanding our manufacturing options for rese-cel, Cabaletta has expanded its CDMO agreement with Lonza, a leading Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO), to supply rese-cel clinical product under current Good Manufacturing Practices as soon as the second half of 2025. In November 2024, Cabaletta presented new and updated clinical data on rese-cel supporting its potential to achieve drug-free, compelling clinical responses based on eight patients dosed across the ongoing Phase 1/2 RESET-Myositis, RESET-SLE\u2122 and RESET-SSc\u2122 clinical trials at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Convergence 2024 conference. Story Continues Strategic Priorities and Anticipated Key Milestones for 2025 Gain alignment with the FDA on a path to registration for rese-cel that leverages our indication-specific trials to rapidly advance registrational programs The Company now plans to meet with the FDA regarding registrational trial designs for rese-cel in the first half of 2025 based on the emerging clinical and translational data and increased pace of enrollment. Enroll patients and complete dosing in multiple disease-specific cohorts across the RESET clinical development program Present new and updated clinical and translational data on rese-cel throughout 2025. Continue advancing innovations designed to expand patient access and provide streamlined and positive experiences with rese-cel for patients and providers Evaluate rese-cel with no preconditioning: Generate clinical and translational data evaluating rese-cel without preconditioning from the RESET-PV trial in 2025. Align with FDA on whole blood replacement for apheresis: Continue to advance the whole blood manufacturing program as a potential replacement for apheresis and seek to align with FDA on a strategy to incorporate it into the RESET clinical development program. Financial Guidance Cabaletta ended the fourth quarter of 2024 with unaudited cash and cash equivalents of $164 million. The Company expects that this cash position as of December 31, 2024 will enable it to fund its updated operating plan, including recently accelerated clinical assumptions, into the first half of 2026. About the RESET-MS\u2122 Trial The RESET-MS\u2122 trial is a Phase 1/2 open-label, dose escalation study of rese-cel in subjects with relapsing and progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), evaluated in separate cohorts. Subjects will receive a one-time infusion of rese-cel following a preconditioning regimen of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. Key inclusion criteria for the relapsing MS cohort include patients between ages 18 to 60 (inclusive), evidence of clinical relapse during the previous 2 years, and prior treatment with a high efficacy therapy for at least 6 months. Key progressive MS inclusion criteria include patients between ages 18 to 60 (inclusive) and evidence of objective disease worsening during the prior year while on standard of care therapy for at least 6 months. Key exclusion criteria for both cohorts include history of fulminant MS within 5 years, a prior history of seizures or other clinically significant concomitant CNS pathology, history of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, as well as treatment with a B cell depleting agent within the prior approximately 20 weeks. About r ese-cel (formerly referred to as CABA-201) Rese-cel is a 4-1BB-containing fully human CD19-CAR T cell investigational therapy for patients with autoimmune diseases where B cells contribute to the initiation and/or maintenance of disease. Following a one-time infusion of a weight-based dose, rese-cel is designed to transiently and completely deplete all CD19-positive cells. This approach has the potential to reset the immune system and result in compelling clinical responses without chronic therapy requirements in patients. Cabaletta is currently evaluating rese-cel in the RESET\u2122 (REstoring SElf-Tolerance) clinical development program which includes multiple disease-specific, company-sponsored clinical trials across growing portfolios of autoimmune diseases in a broad range of therapeutic areas, including rheumatology, neurology and dermatology. About Cabaletta Bio Cabaletta Bio (Nasdaq: CABA) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and launching the first curative targeted cell therapies designed specifically for patients with autoimmune diseases. The CABA\u2122 platform encompasses two complementary strategies which aim to advance the discovery and development of engineered T cell therapies with the potential to become deep and durable, perhaps curative, treatments for a broad range of autoimmune diseases. The lead CARTA (Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells for Autoimmunity) strategy is prioritizing the development of rese-cel, a 4-1BB-containing fully human CD19-CAR T cell investigational therapy. Rese-cel is currently being evaluated in the RESET\u2122 (REstoring SElf-Tolerance) clinical development program spanning multiple therapeutic areas, including rheumatology, neurology and dermatology.

As per the estimates, among the therapies currently in use, immunoglobulins held the largest market share, generating approximately USD 270.3 million in revenue in 2023 across the 7MM. The total diagnosed prevalent cases of idiopathic inflammatory myositis in the 7MM were approximately 191K cases in 2023, which are expected to increase during the forecast period (2020\u20132034). Leading idiopathic inflammatory myositis\u00a0companies such as Pfizer, Argenx, AstraZeneca, Priovant Therapeutics, CSL Behring, Abcuro, Inc., Amgen, Janssen, Galapagos NV, Immunoforge, Merck KGaA (EMD Serono Research & Development Institute), Cabaletta Bio, Restem, and others are developing novel idiopathic inflammatory myositis drugs that can be available in the idiopathic inflammatory myositis market in the coming years. The promising idiopathic inflammatory myositis therapies in the pipeline include Dazukibart, Efgartigimod, SAPHNELO (Anifrolumab), Brepocitinib, HIZENTRA, Empasiprubart, Ulviprubart (ABC008), Daxdilimab, Nipocalimab, Froniglutide (PF1801), GLPG3667, Enpatoran (M5049), CABA-201, Umbilical Cord Lining Stem Cells (ULSC), and others. In November 2024 , argenx decided to continue developing efgartigimod SC (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc) in the ongoing Phase 2/3 ALKIVIA study for adults with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. The decision was based on topline results from the Phase 2 portion, which met the primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant treatment effect in the mean total improvement score (TIS) at Week 24. Additionally, improvements were observed across all six core set measures of the TIS, favoring efgartigimod SC over placebo. Story Continues Discover which therapies are expected to grab the major idiopathic inflammatory myositis market share @ Idiopathic Inflammatory Myositis Market Report Idiopathic Inflammatory Myositis Overview Idiopathic inflammatory myositis (IIM) is a rare autoimmune disorder that leads to muscle inflammation, causing muscle weakness, and in some cases, skin rashes. It encompasses several conditions, including polymyositis, dermatomyositis, inclusion body myositis, and necrotizing autoimmune myopathy. The exact cause of IIM is unknown, but it is thought to be triggered by an autoimmune response where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own muscle tissues. Genetic, environmental, and infectious factors may contribute to the development of the condition. Symptoms of IIM typically include progressive muscle weakness, especially in the upper arms, thighs, neck, and shoulders. Patients may also experience fatigue, difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), joint pain, and in the case of dermatomyositis, a characteristic rash. The rash can appear as red or purple discoloration over the eyelids (heliotrope rash) or a raised, scaly rash on the knuckles (Gottron's papules). Diagnosis involves a combination of clinical examination, blood tests, muscle biopsy, and imaging studies. Blood tests often reveal elevated levels of muscle enzymes, such as creatine kinase (CK), which indicate muscle damage. Electromyography (EMG) can assess muscle electrical activity, while MRI may show muscle inflammation. In certain cases, a muscle biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis by evaluating tissue samples for signs of inflammation and muscle damage. Identifying specific autoantibodies can also assist in diagnosis and help determine the subtype of IIM. Idiopathic Inflammatory Myositis Epidemiology Segmentation The idiopathic inflammatory myositis epidemiology section provides insights into the historical and current idiopathic inflammatory myositis patient pool and forecasted trends for the 7MM. It helps recognize the causes of current and forecasted patient trends by exploring numerous studies and views of key opinion leaders. The idiopathic inflammatory myositis market report\u00a0proffers epidemiological analysis for the study period 2020\u20132034 in the 7MM segmented into: Total Diagnosed Prevalent Cases of Idiopathic Inflammatory Myositis Type-specific Diagnosed Prevalent Cases of Idiopathic Inflammatory Gender-specific Diagnosed Prevalent Cases of Idiopathic Inflammatory Age-specific Diagnosed Prevalent Cases of Idiopathic Inflammatory Myositis Idiopathic Inflammatory Myositis Treatment Market Idiopathic inflammatory myositis, while classified as a rare disease, has become more widely recognized in recent years, thanks to advancements in diagnostic methods, increased awareness among healthcare professionals, and a deeper understanding of the disease. This growing recognition, along with the rising number of diagnosed cases, could fuel the IIM market growth as more patients seek treatment. The management of this condition generally involves a combination of pharmacological treatments and supportive therapies , with the main goals being to reduce inflammation, control symptoms, preserve muscle function, and prevent complications. The treatment landscape for idiopathic inflammatory myositis has evolved to include a comprehensive approach, combining medications, physical therapy, and supportive care. First-line treatments often include high-dose corticosteroids like prednisone or ACTHAR GEL to control inflammation and immune responses. Immunosuppressants, such as methotrexate, azathioprine, and tacrolimus , are commonly used to minimize long-term steroid use. When response to initial therapies is inadequate, biologics like rituximab may be used for targeted immune suppression. Physical therapy remains a crucial component for maintaining muscle strength and function, while additional supportive treatments like NSAIDs and sun protection help alleviate symptoms. Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy, with OCTAGAM 10% approved in the US and Europe and VENOGLOBULIN-IH 5% available in Japan , is another option. For severe, treatment-resistant cases, IV cyclophosphamide may be considered, although its use is limited due to potentially severe side effects. Treatment plans are individualized based on disease severity and patient response, striving to balance efficacy with minimizing adverse effects. There is a significant unmet need for new treatments for idiopathic inflammatory myositis, as current therapies often do not fully manage the condition.

As awareness of IIM rises, early detection and accurate diagnosis are becoming more feasible, leading to timely interventions and better patient outcomes. Additionally, the growing understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of IIM is propelling the development of targeted therapies, such as biologics and immune-modulating drugs. The demand for personalized treatments tailored to individual genetic profiles is also pushing innovation in the market. Furthermore, the rising healthcare expenditure and improved access to specialized care contribute to the market's growth, particularly in developed regions. Finally, ongoing clinical trials and research into novel treatment options continue to fuel optimism for better management and potential cures for IIM, further accelerating the market's expansion. Potential therapies are being investigated for the treatment of idiopathic inflammatory myositis, and it is safe to predict that the treatment space will significantly impact the idiopathic inflammatory myositis\u00a0market during the forecast period. Moreover, the anticipated introduction of emerging therapies with improved efficacy and a further improvement in the diagnosis rate are expected to drive the growth of the idiopathic inflammatory myositis\u00a0market in the 7MM. However several factors may impede the growth of the idiopathic inflammatory myositis market. One of the primary challenges is the rarity and heterogeneous nature of IIM , which makes it difficult to diagnose and classify accurately. This complicates the development of targeted therapies and slows the recruitment of patients for clinical trials, limiting the scope for market expansion. Additionally, the lack of standardized diagnostic criteria and the complexity of managing the disease , which often involves multidisciplinary care, create barriers to effective treatment and patient outcomes. High costs associated with specialized treatments , coupled with reimbursement issues in many regions, further restrict access to therapies. Moreover, the limited understanding of the disease pathophysiology and the lack of robust biomarkers for monitoring disease progression present additional hurdles for both research and treatment optimization. As a result, these factors collectively impede the growth potential of the IIM market, requiring ongoing innovation and policy support to overcome.

investor conference call and webcast today at 8:00 a.m. ET \u2013 PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- \u00a0Cabaletta Bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: CABA), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and launching the first curative targeted cell therapies designed specifically for patients with autoimmune diseases, today announced new and updated clinical data on CABA-201 demonstrating the potential to achieve drug-free, compelling clinical responses based on eight patients dosed across the ongoing Phase 1/2 RESET-Myositis\u2122, RESET-SLE\u2122 and RESET-SSc\u2122 clinical trials. These data were presented in oral and poster presentations at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Convergence 2024, which is being held at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, D.C. from November 14-19, 2024. Presentation materials featured at ACR Convergence 2024 can be accessed on the Company\u2019s website here . \u201cThe clinical data reported at ACR Convergence this weekend support the potential of the current dose of CABA-201 to provide immunosuppressant-free, compelling clinical responses in patients with active, refractory autoimmune disease. Data presented from the previously reported patient with lupus nephritis who experienced ICANS and had acute inflammatory events shortly before CABA-201 treatment demonstrated an abnormal, pro-inflammatory cytokine profile prior to and after CABA-201 infusion, suggestive of an occult infection. As a result of these data, subjects in the RESET clinical program who develop a fever prior to scheduled infusion will wait a minimum of two weeks before administration of CABA-201. Other than this patient with a second, later peak expansion, CABA-201 displayed a consistent PK and PD profile in all other patients,\u201d said David J. Chang, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Cabaletta. \u201cIn addition to our promising clinical and translational data set from the RESET program, we believe our efficient clinical trial design, growing footprint of 40 actively recruiting U.S. clinical sites and anticipated expansion into Europe in 2025 provide us with a differentiated opportunity to accelerate development of CABA-201 for patients. Data permitting, we anticipate meeting with the FDA in 2025 to discuss potential registrational trial designs for CABA-201 that will allow us to bring the therapeutic potential of this investigational therapy closer to autoimmune patients.\u201d Story Continues Cabaletta designed CABA-201, a 4-1BB-containing fully human CD19-CAR T cell investigational therapy, to deeply and transiently deplete CD19-positive B cells following a one-time infusion that may enable a reset of the immune system with the potential for durable remission without chronic immunosuppressive therapies in patients with autoimmune diseases. Cabaletta is currently evaluating CABA-201 in the RESET clinical development program across five company-sponsored clinical trials that each have disease-specific cohorts with six patients per cohort. All cohorts are evaluating the same single, weight-based dose of CABA-201 at 1 x 10 6 cells/kg without a dose escalation requirement. Treatment with CABA-201 in each clinical trial includes a preconditioning regimen of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, consistent with the dosing regimen used in the third-party academic studies, except for the RESET-PV\u2122 trial which is evaluating CABA-201 without preconditioning. New and Updated Clinical Data Summary As of the data cut-off date of November 1, 2024, eight patients had been dosed with CABA-201 with sufficient follow-up to be evaluable across the RESET clinical development program. In the RESET-Myositis trial, one patient in the immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) cohort completed six months of follow-up and two patients, one in the IMNM cohort and one in the dermatomyositis (DM) cohort, each completed one month of follow-up. In the RESET-SLE trial, one patient in the non-renal systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) cohort completed six months of follow-up, one patient in the lupus nephritis (LN) cohort completed four months of follow-up and two patients in the non-renal SLE cohort each completed one month of follow-up. Translational assessments from the third patient in the non-renal SLE cohort were not available for inclusion at the time of the data cut-off. In the RESET-SSc trial, one patient in the severe skin cohort completed six weeks of follow-up. Across these eight patients treated with CABA-201, patients were administered a one-time infusion of CABA-201 at 1 x 10 6 cells/kg, following a preconditioning regimen of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. The primary endpoint of each trial is safety and tolerability within 28 days of infusion. Secondary endpoints include translational assessments and clinical outcomes. Safety and Tolerability Profile: CABA-201 has shown a favorable risk-benefit profile in patients with active and refractory autoimmune disease Through 28 days of follow-up, no evidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) of any grade was observed in five of the eight patients. Low-grade CRS (Grades 1-2) was observed in three patients, all of which recovered following standard care. Tocilizumab was not administered for any cases of CRS. No evidence of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) of any grade has been observed in any patient since reporting the initial safety data on the first LN patient in August 2024. This patient had acute inflammatory events shortly before CABA-201 treatment and demonstrated an abnormal, pro-inflammatory cytokine profile prior to infusion that continued after CABA-201 infusion, suggestive of a possible occult infection. Translational Assessments: CABA-201 induced consistent and complete B cell depletion, with early na\u00efve B cell repopulation suggesting the potential to generate an immune system reset CAR T cell expansion associated with CABA-201 reached its peak between day 8 and day 15. Translational assessments from the first patient in the LN cohort indicated a second peak at day 29. Complete B cell depletion was observed by day 22 after CABA-201 infusion. B cell repopulation occurred in the first two patients treated with CABA-201 as early as 8 weeks and exhibited a transitional na\u00efve phenotype, reflecting the production of new B cells after deep systemic depletion. Two of the three patients with follow-up beyond three months demonstrated a reduction in disease-associated antibodies. Clinical responses in all three of these patients were observed independent of autoantibody levels. Vaccine and infectious pathogen antibodies remained generally stable. Clinical Outcomes: CABA-201 provided compelling signs of early efficacy, supporting the potential for drug-free clinical responses Initial clinical responses in the RESET-Myositis trial were consistent with published data with response kinetics appearing to differ between myositis subtypes. The first known adult DM patient dosed with CAR T in the form of CABA-201 demonstrated an improvement in muscle strength to normal and a major total improvement score (TIS) response off all immunosuppressants at one month of follow-up. The Cutaneous Dermatomyositis Disease Area and Severity Index \u2013 Activity (CDASI-A) improved from 25 to 9. At six months of follow-up, the first IMNM patient demonstrated a continued and improved clinical response off immunosuppressants and without flares. At one month of follow-up, the second IMNM patient demonstrated a total improvement score consistent with the first IMNM patient at one month after CABA-201 infusion off immunosuppressants. All four patients in the RESET-SLE trial demonstrated clinical responses off immunosuppressants. All three patients in the non-renal SLE cohort demonstrated no clinical symptoms on SLEDAI-2K as of the latest follow-up and the first patient has completed a prednisone taper to discontinuation. The first patient in the LN cohort, who experienced the previously reported ICANS event, had a SLEDAI that improved from 22 at baseline to 8 at month four of follow-up. The patient\u2019s proteinuria improved more than 90%, approaching normal levels, while off all immunosuppressants and with an ongoing prednisone taper. The first patient in the severe skin cohort in the RESET-SSc trial demonstrated early clinical improvements after discontinuation of disease-specific therapy. The modified Rodnan Skin Score of the first patient in the severe skin cohort improved from 42 at baseline (potential maximum of 51) to 36 at day 42, suggesting the potential emergence of a drug-free clinical response.

report Nearly 74% of respondents reported experiencing burnout symptoms. Credit: PeopleImages.com - Yuri A/Shutterstock. \u00b7 The Accountant \u00b7 PeopleImages.com - Yuri A/Shutterstock. GlobalData Fri, Nov 22, 2024, 2:20 PM 2 min read A recent report by caba, the occupational charity for ICAEW members, has highlighted the mental health challenges among UK chartered accountants. The study, involving more than 300 accountants, found that more than one in three (36%) experienced insomnia or disrupted sleep in the past year, indicating a high prevalence of burnout and chronic stress within the profession. The report reveals that 32% of accountants have been diagnosed with or self-identify with depression, and 29% have experienced regular panic attacks. Additionally, nearly 74% of respondents reported experiencing burnout symptoms such as detachment, exhaustion, or decreased job performance over the last year. Burnout is seen to have led to feelings of loneliness or isolation for more than 36% of the respondents, while 32% have faced financial difficulties due to their symptoms. In the workplace, 45% of respondents indicated that burnout impaired their job performance or caused them to take time off, and 41% considered changing careers or leaving the profession. The report identifies excessive workload (46%), work-life imbalance (45%), monotonous work (32%), and lack of support from supervisors (31%) as major contributors to burnout. Despite this, more than half (54%) of respondents believe their employer provides sufficient resources to manage burnout. Outside of work, 32% of respondents sought professional help, while 19% are considering it. Among those experiencing burnout, 42% found taking time off work beneficial, 35% reduced their working hours, and 25% sought peer support. caba chief executive Cristian Holmes said: \u201cBeing a chartered accountant is a highly respected and rewarding career choice, and there are a great many people who are incredibly happy in their role. However, for some, long working hours and tight deadlines can make for a high-pressure environment, which can sometimes lead to severe physical, emotional and behavioural symptoms we often associate with burnout. \u201cWe know it can be challenging to reach out and ask for help. We would urge everyone struggling with feelings of burnout to reach out \u2013 whether that\u2019s to a loved one, a friend, a member of their community, or to us. You\u2019ll find that no matter how low you\u2019re feeling there\u2019s always someone there to support and guide you. You\u2019re never alone.\u201d caba has launched a Burnout Support Hub for ICAEW members. Earlier in November 2024, DW Group founder David Wray and FinComm Services president Marie-Jos\u00e9e Privyk, discussed the European Commission's August 2024 FAQs with ICAEW. These FAQs aim to assist companies in understanding the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive requirements.

Bio, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:CABA) latest 25% decline adds to one-year losses, institutional investors may consider drastic measures editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Tue, Dec 10, 2024, 1:44 PM 5 min read In This Article: CABA Key Insights Significantly high institutional ownership implies Cabaletta Bio's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 9 shareholders own 50% of the company Using data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a company A look at the shareholders of Cabaletta Bio, Inc. ( NASDAQ:CABA ) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 75% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. And so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$161m last week after a 25% drop in the share price. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 82% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Often called \u201cmarket movers\", institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Cabaletta Bio, which might have negative implications on individual investors. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Cabaletta Bio. See our latest analysis for Cabaletta Bio NasdaqGS:CABA Ownership Breakdown December 10th 2024 What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Cabaletta Bio? Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. We can see that Cabaletta Bio does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Cabaletta Bio, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. NasdaqGS:CABA Earnings and Revenue Growth December 10th 2024 Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. It would appear that 6.2% of Cabaletta Bio shares are controlled by hedge funds. That catches my attention because hedge funds sometimes try to influence management, or bring about changes that will create near term value for shareholders. The company's largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc., with ownership of 9.8%. T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.6% of common stock, and Adage Capital Management, L.P. holds about 6.2% of the company stock. Furthermore, CEO Steven Nichtberger is the owner of 2.8% of the company's shares. Story Continues We also observed that the top 9 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily. Insider Ownership Of Cabaletta Bio The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. We can report that insiders do own shares in Cabaletta Bio, Inc.. In their own names, insiders own US$5.0m worth of stock in the US$161m company. Some would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board, though we generally prefer to see bigger insider holdings. But it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public Ownership The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 10% stake in Cabaletta Bio. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. Private Equity Ownership With an ownership of 5.6%, private equity firms are in a position to play a role in shaping corporate strategy with a focus on value creation. Some might like this, because private equity are sometimes activists who hold management accountable. But other times, private equity is selling out, having taking the company public. Next Steps: I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.
