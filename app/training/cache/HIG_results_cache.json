[{"text": "The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.'s (NYSE:HIG) Stock Been Rising: Are Strong Financials Guiding The Market? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Tue, Jan 28, 2025, 5:00 PM 4 min read In This Article: HIG -0.40% Hartford Financial Services Group's (NYSE:HIG) stock is up by 3.9% over the past month. Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company\u2019s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study Hartford Financial Services Group's ROE in this article. Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Hartford Financial Services Group How Is ROE Calculated? The formula for return on equity is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Hartford Financial Services Group is: 18% = US$3.0b \u00f7 US$17b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024). The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.18 in profit. What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth? Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. A Side By Side comparison of Hartford Financial Services Group's Earnings Growth And 18% ROE At first glance, Hartford Financial Services Group seems to have a decent ROE. Especially when compared to the industry average of 14% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This probably laid the ground for Hartford Financial Services Group's moderate 9.1% net income growth seen over the past five years. Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Hartford Financial Services Group's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 12% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see. NYSE:HIG Past Earnings Growth January 28th 2025 Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in.

Story Continues Is Hartford Financial Services Group Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?

This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business. Additionally, Hartford Financial Services Group has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders.
