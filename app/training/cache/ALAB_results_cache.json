[{"text": "Astera Labs (ALAB): This Stock Is Hurting From DeepSeek AI News That Could Turn Into Multibaggers Jabran Kundi Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 10:27 PM 3 min read We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Hurting From DeepSeek AI News That Could Turn Into Multibaggers . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Astera Labs (NASDAQ:ALAB) stands against the other stocks. US semiconductor stocks are getting hammered after the Chinese launched an AI model that has many questioning United States dominance in the AI space. China is currently facing restrictions on importing state-of-the-art semiconductor equipment needed for AI training. The launch of DeepSeek AI despite these restrictions is an eye-opener for Western tech companies, and the investor sentiment is reflecting it. As market participants scamper to gather more information on China\u2019s progress, we decided to look at stocks that are not only taking a hit from this news but also provide an attractive buy-the-dip opportunity. Against the backdrop of Project Stargate, a US government initiative to pump private sector investments into AI infrastructure, these companies also offer a potential multi-bagger opportunity. Usually, it is the low market cap companies that become multibaggers. However, the failure rate when betting on these companies is quite high. We therefore chose companies with a market cap between $10 and $25 billion. In this way, our list contains businesses that are already established and will thrive on the boost provided by Project Stargate while successfully managing any headwinds. We believe the downside to these stocks is minimal because of the already sound fundamentals of these companies.

Astera Labs (NASDAQ:ALAB) Astera Labs is a semiconductor company that manufactures and supplies purpose-built connectivity solutions for AI and cloud infrastructure. The company is set to be a beneficiary of the increased spending by hyperscalers as a result of Project Stargate. ALAB not only collaborates with Nvidia but also has key partnerships with Micron, Intel, and AMD. Its latest product, the Scorpio Smart Fabric Switch, specifically targets cloud AI infrastructure and could be a key part of all future data center installations. In fact, ALAB\u2019s products, especially the P-series switches, are an integral part of Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell line of GPUs. The only thing that investors need to keep an eye on is the company\u2019s reliance on a handful of companies for a major portion of its revenue. Only 3 companies account for 72% of the company\u2019s revenue, which is a high-concentration risk. The stock is down 15% during trading today. Story Continues Overall ALAB ranks 7th on our list of the stocks that are hurting from DeepSeek AI news that could turn into multibaggers. While we acknowledge the potential of ALAB as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as ALAB but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock .

(ALAB) Among the Best New Tech Stocks to Invest In? Maham Fatima Sat, Jan 25, 2025, 12:11 AM 5 min read We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best New Tech Stocks To Invest In . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Astera Labs, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALAB) stands against the other feminist stocks. On January 8, Rashaun Williams, Atlanta Falcons limited partner and venture capitalist, joined \"Closing Bell\" on CNBC to discuss his investment strategy and his outlook on the IPO market as 2025 began. He acknowledged the high expectations for a revival in the tech sector's IPO activity but noted that such optimism required multiple factors to align perfectly, something that had not yet occurred. Despite this, he emphasized the importance of holding onto optimism, as the tech IPO market continues driving innovation and economic growth. Williams highlighted that while the primary IPO market faced challenges, the secondary market had gained prominence, which provided liquidity for founders and employees. This ensured that companies could sustain themselves through downturns. Williams also discussed his perspective as an alternative investment manager and noted a shift in investor interest toward alternative assets. Over the past year, he observed heightened enthusiasm for late-stage tech companies, particularly those focused on AI and cybersecurity. These sectors have been pivotal in driving activity within his portfolio and funds. He emphasized that late-stage AI companies are generating substantial interest due to their transformative potential and alignment with current technological trends. On the same day,\u00a0Keith Fitz-Gerald, principal of Fitz-Gerald Group, also appeared on CNBC on 'The Exchange' to discuss his bullish case for tech. As 2025 began, the tech sector experienced a notable decline, with the NASDAQ 100 falling 1.5%, largely due to NVIDIA\u2019s 5% drop, which shaved 90 points off the index. Despite this, Fitz-Gerald viewed the downturn as an opportunity. He highlighted the imminent monetization of AI and described the recent rally as child's play, and predicted that the S&P 500 could exceed 7,000 by midyear, which was a bold claim grounded in his belief in the strength of US-based AI companies with dominant market positions and profit margins. On concerns about high valuations, he acknowledged historical trends linking elevated P/E ratios to lower returns but argued that this is misleading for digital companies. He explained that businesses benefiting from economies of scale, like those in AI, naturally exhibit higher P/E ratios due to minimal costs for acquiring incremental customers. This signal strength rather than overvaluation. He dismissed concerns about the current market softness and characterized it as a technical sell-off due to large traders reallocating funds rather than a reflection of weak fundamentals. He said that AI\u2019s expansion and the trillions being invested into it mark only the beginning of a transformative era for tech. Story Continues Methodology We first used the Finviz stock screener to look for companies that went public in the past 3 years. We sorted our screen by IPO date and market cap and looked through the top 35 stocks that recently went public and are trading at a valuation of over $1 billion. We then selected 15 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ( s ee more details here ). Arbe Robotics Ltd. (ARBE): Revolutionizing Autonomous Driving with 4D Imaging Radar Technology High angle view of a semiconductor chip against an array of electronics components. Astera Labs, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALAB ) Market Capitalization as of January 21: $21.14 billion Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39 Astera Labs Inc. (NASDAQ:ALAB) develops semiconductor solutions for high-performance computing and specializes in intelligent connectivity for cloud and AI infrastructure. Its technology optimizes data flow within complex systems and enables faster and more efficient data processing. Morgan Stanley downgraded its stock to Equal Weight on January 21 and reiterated a $142 target price because it believes that the market has already factored in the positive impact of the company's new PCIe switches. The competition from Nvidia's Blackwell platform and other players challenges the company as well. Despite these concerns, Morgan Stanley expects Astera Labs Inc. (NASDAQ:ALAB) to surpass financial projections in the upcoming quarter due to increasing ASIC sales. The company's Q3 2024 revenue surged 47% sequentially to a record $113.1 million due to the demand for its Aries and Taurus products. These are product lines for high-speed data transmission within data centers, with Taurus specifically focusing on 400-gig Ethernet applications. The company also initiated preproduction shipments of its new Scorpio Smart Fabric Switch family in Q3. It is designed for high-speed PCIe Gen 6 connectivity in AI systems. This growth reflects the importance of high-bandwidth connectivity solutions. Overall ALAB ranks 2nd on our list of the new tech stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of ALAB as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Motley Fool Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 12:51 AM 3 min read Astera Labs (NASDAQ: ALAB) stock is sinking this week following new analyst coverage. The semiconductor specialist's share price had fallen as low as 15.8% for the week during Thursday's trading before recovering to a 7.1% dip on the week, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence . Morgan Stanley published new coverage on Astera Labs before the market opened Thursday, downgrading its rating on the stock from overweight to equal weight. The company maintained its one-year price target on the stock at $142 per share. Astera Labs stock falls on Morgan Stanley coverage On the heels of big gains for Astera Labs stock, Morgan Stanley no longer sees sufficient upside potential to classify the stock as a buy. At the time of the note's publication, the firm's one-year price target of $142 per share implied additional upside of 6.6%. Now that the stock has fallen in conjunction with the new coverage, Morgan Stanley's one-year price target suggests potential upside of roughly 14.8%. The firm's analysts think that Astera will continue serving up very strong sales growth, but they view the stock as richly valued. While they expect that the business will continue to benefit from ramping sales on new products, they believe these positive catalysts have already largely been priced into the stock. What's next for Astera Labs? Astera Labs stock is still up roughly 134% over the past six months. The company has a market capitalization of approximately $18.5 billion, and it's valued at 30 times expected sales and 100 times expected earnings. ALAB Market Cap data by YCharts Astera Labs has seen its sales and valuation soar in conjunction with demand and excitement surrounding the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The company makes components that are included in some of Nvidia 's processors, and it's seen some strong sales performance in conjunction with strong performance for the AI leader and other players in the semiconductor industry. With its last quarterly report, Astera Labs announced that its revenue had increased 206% year over year to hit $113.1 million. The company also managed to post a gross margin of 77.7% in the period, which suggests the potential for very strong earnings growth down the line if sales continue to increase at a brisk pace. The company is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter results and host a conference call after the market closes on Feb. 10, giving investors a close a look at recent business performance and how trends are shaping up for the company.
