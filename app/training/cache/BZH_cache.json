Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 8, 2025, 4:42 PM 2 min read In This Article: BZH Investors in Beazer Homes USA, Inc. BZH need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Feb 21, 2025 $24 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. What is Implied Volatility? Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy. What do the Analysts Think? Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Beazer Homes shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company?

Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has moved from 43 cents per share to 31 cents in that period. Given the way analysts feel about Beazer Homes right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay.

"REGIONAL HEALTH PROPERTIES AND SUNLINK HEALTH SYSTEMS TO MERGE IN AN ALL-STOCK TRANSACTION Regional Health Properties, Inc. Mon, Jan 6, 2025, 3:23 PM 13 min read In This Article: RHE RHE-PA Regional Health Properties, Inc. Enhances Opportunity to Increase Shareholder Value Significantly Strengthens Balance Sheet Expands Regional Board with the Addition of Two Highly Qualified Industry Veterans Atlanta, GA, Jan. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Regional Health Properties, Inc. (\u201cRegional\u201d) (NYSE American: RHE) (NYSE American: RHE-PA) and SunLink Health Systems, Inc. (\u201cSunLink\u201d) (NYSE American: SSY) jointly announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger (the \u201cmerger agreement\u201d), pursuant to which SunLink will merge with and into Regional (the \u201cmerger\u201d) in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate of 1,410,000 shares of Regional common stock and 1,410,000 shares of Regional\u2019s newly-authorized Series D 8% Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $10 per share. The merger has been approved unanimously by each company\u2019s board of directors and completion of the transaction is subject to the receipt of the approvals of the shareholders of both Regional and SunLink, regulatory approvals and satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Brent S. Morrison, Regional\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated: \u201cThis merger will create a combined company with a stronger balance sheet and greater scale. In addition, by combining SunLink\u2019s complementary assets with Regional\u2019s platform of healthcare facilities, the combined company will be well-positioned for future growth.\u201d Robert M. Thornton, Jr., SunLink\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated: \u201cSunLink has been seeking a merger partner that would benefit from our complementary pharmacy business, cash and balance sheet that has no debt. We believe the combination of SunLink with Regional, whose assets consist of established skilled nursing and senior living facilities offers, the opportunity for increased value to both the SunLink and Regional shareholders.\u201d Highlights Regional has agreed to provide for each five (5) SunLink common shares (i) one share of Regional common stock and (ii) subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, one share of Series D 8% Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Participating Preferred Shares (\u201cRegional Series D Preferred Stock\u201d); other than SunLink dissenting shares and shares to be cancelled in accordance with the terms and conditions of the merger agreement. As a result of the transaction, SunLink shareholders will own approximately 43.0% of the combined company. As of December 31, 2024, SunLink had approximately $17.6 million in total assets and no long-term debt. Regional expects pre-tax cost synergies of approximately $1.0 million by the end of its fiscal 2026 and believes that additional operating synergies may be achievable upon completion of the merger and integration of the companies. The board of the combined company will add two experienced industry veterans: C. Christian Winkle and Scott Kellman. The transaction is expected to be completed in the spring of 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both Regional and SunLink. Story Continues Summary of the Transaction Consideration Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, for each five shares of SunLink common stock (other than dissenting shares and shares to be cancelled in accordance with the terms and conditions of the merger agreement), Regional will issue (i) one share of Regional common stock and (ii) subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, one share of Regional Series D Preferred Stock. Based on the current number of shares of Regional common stock and SunLink common stock outstanding, Regional expects to issue approximately 1,410,000 shares of common stock as well as approximately 1,410,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock to SunLink\u2019s shareholders in the transaction. Each three shares of Regional Series D Preferred Stock are convertible into one shares of Regional common stock at the holder\u2019s option and mandatorily by Regional if certain future conditions are met. As a result of the transaction, SunLink shareholders will own approximately 43.0% of the combined company. No fractional shares will be issued in the transaction. In addition, upon shareholder approval of the merger, SunLink may pay, subject to available cash and expected cash requirements for closing, a one-time, special dividend to its shareholders. The Regional Series D Preferred Stock will be a new series of Regional preferred stock that will rank junior to the 12.5% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Regional. The Regional Series D Preferred Stock will have an initial liquidation preference of $10.00 per share and an initial dividend rate of 8% per annum, each subject to adjustment as set forth in the articles of amendment establishing the series. Beginning on July 1, 2027, holders of issued and outstanding Series D Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if approved by the Regional board of directors out of funds of Regional legally available for the payment of distributions and declared by Regional, cumulative preferential dividends, subject to the terms and conditions of the articles of amendment establishing the series. Each three shares of Regional Series D Preferred Stock are convertible into one share of Regional common stock at the holders\u2019 option and mandatorily if Regional meets certain future conditions. Leadership, Corporate Governance and Headquarters The combined company will be led by a proven management team that reflects the strengths and capabilities of both organizations.

(BZH) the Best Housing Stock to Invest In According to Analysts? Zarah Hamid Sat, Jan 4, 2025, 12:46 AM 5 min read In This Article: BZH We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Housing Stocks to Invest in According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Beazer Homes USA, Inc. (NYSE:BZH) stands against the other housing stocks. T he US Housing Market: An Outlook for 2025 According to the National Association of Realtors, sales of previously owned homes rose 4.8% in November as compared to October. Contracts for these homes were likely signed in September and October as mortgage rates fell to an 18-month low in September but then moved higher in October. Regarding the future of mortgage rates, Compass CEO Robert Reffkin expects mortgage rates to stay around the 6% range for the next two years instead of rates declining to the 5% range in the next year or even the following. In an interview with CNBC, Reffkin states that the market will improve, with pending applications to purchase a home currently up 10% year-over-year. He considers not having enough inventory to be the key issue. While inventory has climbed over the year which is a positive, it is still 20% less than pre-pandemic levels. On December 18, The Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark rate by another quarter point marking its third rate cut in 2024. However, mortgage rates rose. For the week ending December 19, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate spiked to 6.72%. Orphe Divounguy, Zillow senior economist, joined CNBC to talk about the firm's 2025 housing market outlook. He stuck to an optimistic view for the coming year pointing towards mortgage rates easing relative to their current levels which is going to drive higher home sales. Regarding increasing home sales, Divounguy thinks new construction will see more activity. New home sales increased in November regardless of the increase in mortgage rates. Meanwhile, existing home sales are expected to rebound but not that much. Thus, the overall housing market will be healthy considering more homeowners starting to come back to the housing market. Ivy Zelman, Zelman & Associates executive vice president, countered the above optimistic view as she expects more challenges ahead for the housing market. In an interview with CNBC, she mentioned how the entry-level buyer remains troubled due to affordability issues which are worse off with elevated mortgage rates. As the affordability index is about 25% above the trend line for existing homes and 10% to 15% higher for new homes, the market is challenging.
