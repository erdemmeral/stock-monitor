IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Limitation of Use: LIVMARLI is not for use in PFIC type 2 patients who have a severe defect in the bile salt export pump (BSEP) protein. LIVMARLI can cause side effects, including: Liver injury. Changes in certain liver tests are common in patients with Alagille syndrome and PFIC but can worsen during treatment. These changes may be a sign of liver injury. In PFIC, this can be serious or may lead to liver transplant or death. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests and physical exams before starting and during treatment to check your liver function. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you get any signs or symptoms of liver problems, including nausea or vomiting, skin or the white part of the eye turns yellow, dark or brown urine, pain on the right side of the stomach (abdomen), bloating in your stomach area, loss of appetite or bleeding or bruising more easily than normal.

Your healthcare provider may advise you to monitor for new or worsening stomach problems including stomach pain, diarrhea, blood in your stool or vomiting. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms more often or more severely than normal for you. A condition called Fat Soluble Vitamin (FSV) Deficiency caused by low levels of certain vitamins (vitamin A, D, E, and K) stored in body fat is common in patients with Alagille syndrome and PFIC but may worsen during treatment. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before starting and during treatment and may monitor for bone fractures and bleeding which have been reported as common side effects. US Prescribing Information EU SmPC Canadian Product Monograph About Volixibat Volixibat is an oral, minimally absorbed agent designed to selectively inhibit the ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT). Volixibat may offer a novel approach in the treatment of adult cholestatic diseases by blocking the recycling of bile acids, through inhibition of IBAT, thereby reducing bile acids systemically and in the liver. Volixibat is currently being evaluated in Phase 2b studies for primary sclerosing cholangitis ( VISTAS study ), and primary biliary cholangitis ( VANTAGE study ). In June, Mirum announced positive interim results from the Phase 2b VANTAGE study showing statistically significant improvement in pruritus as well as meaningful reductions in serum bile acids and improvements in fatigue for patients treated with volixibat. No new safety signals were observed, and the most common adverse event was diarrhea with all cases mild to moderate. About CHOLBAM \u00ae (cholic acid) capsules The FDA approved CHOLBAM \u00ae (cholic acid) capsules in March 2015, the first FDA-approved treatment for pediatric and adult patients with bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects, and for adjunctive treatment of patients with peroxisome biogenesis disorder-Zellweger spectrum disorder. The effectiveness of CHOLBAM \u00ae has been demonstrated in clinical trials for bile acid synthesis disorders and the adjunctive treatment of peroxisomal disorders. An estimated 200 to 300 patients are current candidates for therapy. CHOLBAM \u00ae (cholic acid) Indication CHOLBAM is a bile acid indicated for Treatment of bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects. Adjunctive treatment of peroxisomal disorders, including Zellweger spectrum disorders, in patients who exhibit manifestations of liver disease, steatorrhea, or complications from decreased fat-soluble vitamin absorption. LIMITATIONS OF USE The safety and effectiveness of CHOLBAM on extrahepatic manifestations of bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects or peroxisomal disorders, including Zellweger spectrum disorders, have not been established. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2013 Exacerbation of liver impairment Monitor liver function and discontinue CHOLBAM in patients who develop worsening of liver function while on treatment. Concurrent elevations of serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) may indicate CHOLBAM overdose. Discontinue treatment with CHOLBAM at any time if there are clinical or laboratory indicators of worsening liver function or cholestasis. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (\u22651%) are diarrhea, reflux esophagitis, malaise, jaundice, skin lesion, nausea, abdominal pain, intestinal polyp, urinary tract infection, and peripheral neuropathy. Please see full Prescribing Information for additional Important Safety Information. About Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare, progressive and underdiagnosed disorder of cholesterol metabolism affecting many parts of the body. In people with CTX, the body is unable to break down cholesterol properly causing toxins (e.g., cholestanol and bile alcohols) to build up throughout the body over time. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive genetic manner. Signs and symptoms of CTX include neonatal cholestasis (jaundice or bile flow interruption), chronic diarrhea, the development of bilateral cataracts before the age of 18, development of tendon xanthomas (fatty deposits in the tendons) during teenage years or later, and neurologic deterioration. The types, combinations and severity of symptoms can be different from person to person making diagnosis challenging and often delayed. About chenodiol tablets Chenodiol tablets is another name for chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). CDCA is a naturally occurring bile acid that was originally approved for the treatment of people with radiolucent stones in the gallbladder. More recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted chenodiol orphan drug designation for cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). CTX is a rare progressive disorder that can affect the brain, spinal cord, tendons, eyes and arteries. Chenodiol is not yet indicated for the treatment of CTX but has received a medical necessity determination in the U.S. by the FDA.

Therapeutics, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ALGS) biggest owners are retail investors who got richer after stock soared 17% last week editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sat, Dec 21, 2024, 4:43 PM 5 min read In This Article: ALGS -12.52% Key Insights Significant control over Aligos Therapeutics by retail investors implies that the general public has more power to influence management and governance-related decisions The top 7 shareholders own 50% of the company 19% of Aligos Therapeutics is held by Institutions A look at the shareholders of Aligos Therapeutics, Inc. ( NASDAQ:ALGS ) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 33% to be precise, is retail investors. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk). As a result, retail investors collectively scored the highest last week as the company hit US$142m market cap following a 17% gain in the stock. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Aligos Therapeutics. See our latest analysis for Aligos Therapeutics NasdaqCM:ALGS Ownership Breakdown December 21st 2024 What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Aligos Therapeutics? Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. Aligos Therapeutics already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Aligos Therapeutics, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. NasdaqCM:ALGS Earnings and Revenue Growth December 21st 2024 It would appear that 24% of Aligos Therapeutics shares are controlled by hedge funds. That worth noting, since hedge funds are often quite active investors, who may try to influence management. Many want to see value creation (and a higher share price) in the short term or medium term. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Roche Holding AG with 12% of shares outstanding. With 9.6% and 8.6% of the shares outstanding respectively, EcoR1 Capital, LLC and Armistice Capital LLC are the second and third largest shareholders. In addition, we found that Lawrence Blatt, the CEO has 2.3% of the shares allocated to their name. On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 7 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones. Story Continues Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. Insider Ownership Of Aligos Therapeutics The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Aligos Therapeutics, Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$142m, and insiders have US$6.7m worth of shares, in their own names. This shows at least some alignment, but we usually like to see larger insider holdings. You can click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public Ownership The general public-- including retail investors -- own 33% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies. Private Equity Ownership With a stake of 6.6%, private equity firms could influence the Aligos Therapeutics board. Some might like this, because private equity are sometimes activists who hold management accountable. But other times, private equity is selling out, having taking the company public. Public Company Ownership We can see that public companies hold 12% of the Aligos Therapeutics shares on issue. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further. Next Steps: While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

(ALGS) Reports Q3 Loss, Tops Revenue Estimates Zacks Equity Research Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 2:05 AM 3 min read In This Article: ALGS -12.52% Aligos Therapeutics, Inc. (ALGS) came out with a quarterly loss of $3.07 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $2.15. This compares to loss of $10.25 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -42.79%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post a loss of $4 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.75, delivering a surprise of 118.75%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. Aligos Therapeutics , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, posted revenues of $1.27 million for the quarter ended September 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 26.90%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.15 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Aligos Therapeutics shares have lost about 40.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 21.2%. What's Next for Aligos Therapeutics? While Aligos Therapeutics has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Aligos Therapeutics: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results Aligos Therapeutics Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 12:05 AM 9 min read In This Article: ALGS -12.52% Aligos Therapeutics SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Nov. 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aligos Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGS, \u201cAligos\u201d), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on improving patient outcomes through best-in-class therapies for liver and viral diseases, today reported recent business progress and financial results for the third quarter 2024. \u201cThis quarter we reached a key milestone when we announced the positive topline HERALD data in MASH subjects,\u201d stated Lawrence Blatt, Ph.D., MBA, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Aligos Therapeutics. \u201cWith placebo-adjusted median relative reductions in liver fat of up to 46.2%, we continue to believe ALG-055009 has best-in-class potential. We are completing Phase 2b enabling studies and evaluating a variety of options to fund continued development, including potential partnering where discussions are underway. In addition, we are progressing ALG-000184 for CHB towards a Phase 2 study next year. Lastly, we expect to begin externally funded clinical studies for ALG-097558 later this year in COVID subjects. 2024 has been an exciting year for the company, and we believe we are laying the groundwork for important future successes in 2025 and beyond.\u201d Recent Business Progress Aligos Portfolio of Drug Candidates ALG-000184: Potential first-/best-in-class small molecule CAM-E for CHB Dosing continues in this ongoing Phase 1a/1b study, with subjects expected to dose for up to 96 weeks. Additional interim data readouts are planned to be presented this year at the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease\u2019s (AASLD) The Liver Meeting (TLM) 2024 Received positive feedback from the FDA and the National Medical Products Administration in China to move forward with sustained HBV DNA suppression as the primary efficacy endpoint for future studies designed to support the potential registration of ALG-000184 for the treatment of hepatitis B infection Announced a clinical collaboration with Xiamen Amoytop Biotech Co., Ltd. Amoytop agreed to sponsor and perform a Phase 1b exploratory clinical study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ALG-000184 in combination with PEGBING\u00ae (mipeginterferon alfa-2b) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients in China Phase 2 enabling activities are underway, including drug supply manufacturing ALG-055009: Potential best-in-class small molecule THR-\u03b2 agonist for MASH Topline HERALD data were presented in September 2024, demonstrating that ALG-055009 dose groups met the primary endpoint with statistically significant reductions in liver fat at Week 12 as measured by MRI-PDFF Doses of 0.5 mg to 0.9 mg ALG-055009 demonstrated statistically significant reductions in liver fat at Week 12, with placebo-adjusted median relative reductions up to 46.2% as measured by MRI-PDFF. Up to 70% of subjects achieved \u226530% relative reduction in liver fat compared to baseline ALG-055009 demonstrated a favorable tolerability profile with no clinical hyper/hypothyroidism. Incidence of gastrointestinal-related treatment emergent adverse events were similar in ALG-055009 dose groups compared to placebo. Specifically, a non-dose-related, lower incidence of diarrhea was observed in ALG-055009 dose groups compared to placebo Treatment with ALG-055009 resulted in significant reductions in atherogenic lipids, including LDL-C, lipoprotein (a) (LpA), and apolipoprotein B (ApoB). In addition, dose dependent increases in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), a marker of THR-\u03b2 target engagement in the liver, were observed Additional data readouts are planned to be presented this year at AASLD\u2019s The Liver Meeting (TLM) 2024 Story Continues ALG-097558: Potential best-in-class small molecule pan-coronavirus protease inhibitor Three additional clinical studies are expected to begin in 2024 AGILE University of Liverpool, a UK-government supported platform trial (with MRC and Wellcome Trust funding), has agreed to sponsor and perform a study in high-risk COVID patients evaluating ALG-097558 as monotherapy or in combination with remdesivir The NIAID has agreed to sponsor clinical studies evaluating pharmacokinetic (PK) differences in special populations (renal/hepatic impairment subjects) Phase 2 enabling activities, including nonclinical and clinical studies, are underway with financial support from the NIH Financial Results for the Third Quarter 2024 Cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $74.9 million as of September 30, 2024, compared with $135.7 million as of December 31, 2023. We continue to believe our cash balance provides sufficient cash to fund planned operations through the end of 2025. Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $19.3 million or basic and diluted net loss per common share of $(3.07), compared to net losses of $18.0 million or basic and diluted net loss per common share of $(10.37) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Research and development (R&D) expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $16.8 million, compared with $15.9 million for the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in third party expenses for the clinical trials. Total R&D stock-based compensation expense incurred for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $1.2 million, compared with $1.6 million for the same period of 2023. General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $4.6 million, compared with $6.4 million for the same period of 2023. The decrease in G&A expenses for this comparative period is primarily due to a decrease in third party expenses including legal expenses. Total G&A stock-based compensation expense incurred for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $0.9 million, compared with $1.6 million for the same period of 2023. Interest and other income, net, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was income of $1.0 million compared with income of $1.1 million for the same period of 2023.

improvement in severe itch and serum bile acid levels in patients with PFIC and ALGS Ipsen Pharma Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 9:00 AM 17 min read In This Article: IPSEF 0.00% IPSEY 0.00% Ipsen Pharma Ipsen presents 3 late-breaking presentations and 8 abstracts across rare cholestatic liver disease portfolio at AASLD 2024 PARIS, FRANCE, 18 November, 2024 Ipsen (Euronext: IPN; ADR: IPSEY) today announced data at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) assessing the long-term efficacy and safety of patients treated with Bylvay \u00ae from two Phase III open-label extension studies: late-breaking abstract (#5045) on PEDFIC 2 in Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC) and oral presentation ASSERT-EXT (#50) in Alagille syndrome (ALGS). Sustained efficacy data and improvements in height, weight and sleep measures were observed for patients treated with Bylvay for at least 72 weeks in both rare cholestatic diseases. \u201cWe know from our work with patient communities that receiving a diagnosis of PFIC and ALGS can be overwhelming in a patient or caregivers\u2019 life. Disease symptoms like severe itch can have an impact on the whole family,\u201d said Sandra Silvestri, EVP Chief Medical Officer, Ipsen. \u201cData suggesting Bylvay-treated patients experienced sustained efficacy, and which support the safety and tolerability profile seen in previous clinical trials, are important. Ipsen is committed to being the leader across rare cholestatic liver diseases and we are just getting started.\u201d PEDFIC 2 Study in PFIC \u201cThese open-label extension data from PEDFIC 2 suggest that the initial reduction in pruritus and in serum bile acid levels achieved following initiation of odevixibat are being sustained into the longer term,\u201d said Dr. Richard J. Thompson, Professor of Molecular Hepatology, King\u2019s College London and principal investigator of the PEDFIC 2 trial. \u201cWe are also observing reductions in both pruritus and serum bile acid across a number of PFIC subtypes. This is important information for our understanding of the therapeutic management of our patients living with PFIC.\u201d PEDFIC 2 was an open-label extension study (n=116; patients from PEDFIC 1 Bylvay and placebo cohorts at week 24, and new Bylvay-na\u00efve patients of any age and PFIC subtype), evaluating the efficacy and safety of Bylvay through 72 weeks (n=83). 1 The data showed a clinically meaningful 1-point reduction in pruritus score at week 72 in 42 percent of patients <18 years old with PFIC 1 and 2 who transitioned to Bylvay at 24 weeks (n=5/12) and 61 percent of patients with any type of PFIC and of any age excluding episodic (n=19/31). Rapid initial pruritus scores achieved by week 4 were sustained for patients who remained on treatment. At 72 weeks, the mean change in serum bile acid (sBA) levels from patients who transition to Bylvay at week 24 (n=15) was \u2013104.00 \u00b5mol/L and Bylvay-treated patients (n=43) was -57.97 \u00b5mol/L . Story Continues Beyond the clinically meaningful and sustained improvements seen in pruritus and sBA levels, height, weight and sleep increases were reported at 72 weeks in Bylvay-treated patients. Most adverse events in Bylvay-treated patients over the duration of the study were reported as mild or moderate. The most common were gastrointestinal (17.2 percent; n=20/116), including diarrhea (12 percent; n=14/116). In two cases, diarrhea led to one treatment interruption and one discontinuation. Assert-EXT Study in ALGS \u201cThe sustained improvements we've seen in Bylvay-treated individuals living with Alagille syndrome are encouraging,\u201d said Dr. Nadia Ovchinsky, Chief, Division of Gastroenterology and\u00a0Hepatology, Hassenfeld Children's Hospital at NYU Langone, New York. and principal investigator of the ASSERT trial. \u201cThese results not only show the potential to manage symptoms like pruritus, which can be extremely difficult for children and their parents to manage, but we\u2019re also seeing a consistent safety profile over the longer term with sustained tolerability.\u201d In ASSERT-EXT, the open-label extension study (n=50) evaluating the long-term efficacy and safety of Bylvay in ALGS patients (ages 1-15.9 years) through 72 weeks (n=44), sustained improvements were observed in pruritus and sBA levels through 72 weeks. 2 At week 72, 93 percent (n=28/30) of patients who received Bylvay throughout the 24 weeks ASSERT trial and 77 percent (n=10/13) of those who transitioned from placebo to Bylvay at week 24 experienced a clinically meaningful \u22651 point reduction in pruritus score. Reductions in sBA levels were also observed in patients treated with Bylvay for 72 weeks showing a mean reduction of 124 \u00b5mol/L in those who continuously received Bylvay and a mean reduction of 139 \u00b5mol/L in patients who transitioned from placebo to Bylvay. Mean changes from baseline were observed in height (8.2 cm) and weight (2.8 kg) on continuous Bylvay use and for patients who transitioned from placebo to Bylvay, height (10.7 cm) and weight (3.3 kg) mean changes were also reported. Improvements in sleep were observed from weeks 24 to 72 across all four sleep parameters (n=43), including proportion of days seeing blood due to scratching, proportion of days needing help falling asleep, proportion of days needing soothing and daytime tiredness. Data supports the safety profile in the ASSERT clinical trial for Bylvay. Treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) occurred in 18 percent (n=6/33) of patients who continuously received Bylvay and 41 percent (n=7/17) of patients who transitioned from placebo to Bylvay. Most adverse events were mild or moderate with diarrhea as the most common TEAE. One TEAE led to discontinuation. About PFIC and ALGS PFIC is a group of rare genetic disorders in which bile acids build up in the liver, causing damage, which may result in liver failure. ALGS is also a rare genetic disorder, affecting multiple organs including the liver, heart, skeleton, eyes and kidneys. Without early diagnosis and effective management, people living with PFIC and ALGS may need a liver transplant. Debilitating itch, caused as a result of the serum bile acid build up, is one of the most common symptoms of both PFIC and ALGS, significantly impacting sleep and daily activities and resulting in skin mutilation, loss of sleep, irritability, and poor attention.

About Bylvay (odevixibat) Odevixibat is a once-daily non-systemic ileal bile acid transport (IBAT) inhibitor approved under the brand name Bylvay \u00ae in the U.S. as the first drug treatment option for patients 3 months of age and older living with cholestatic pruritus due to progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC). BYLVAY may not be effective in a subgroup of PFIC type 2 patients with specific ABCB11 variants resulting in non-functional or complete absence of the bile salt export pump protein. Odevixibat was also approved in June 2021 in the E.U. under the brand name Bylvay \u00ae , as the first drug treatment option for all types of PFIC in patients aged 6 months or older. Bylvay has received orphan exclusivity for the treatment of PFIC in the U.S. and E.U. In June 2023 Bylvay was approved in the U.S. for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients from 12 months of age with Alagille syndrome (ALGS) and received orphan exclusivity for ALGS. In September 2024, odevixibat was approved in the E.U under the brand name Kayfanda \u00ae for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in ALGS in patients aged 6 months or older. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION \u2013 U.S. Warnings and Precautions: Liver Test Abnormalities Patients who enrolled in PFIC and ALGS clinical trials had abnormal liver tests at baseline. In clinical\u00a0trials, treatment-emergent elevations of liver tests or worsening of liver tests relative to baseline values were observed. Most abnormalities included elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) in PFIC and ALGS, and total and direct bilirubin in PFIC clinical trials. No patients permanently discontinued treatment due to liver test abnormalities. Obtain baseline liver tests and monitor during treatment. Dose reduction or treatment interruption\u00a0may be required if abnormalities occur. For persistent or recurrent liver test abnormalities, consider treatment discontinuation. Permanently discontinue Bylvay if a patient progresses to portal hypertension or experiences a\u00a0hepatic decompensation event. Diarrhea Diarrhea occurred in both PFIC and ALGS clinical trials in BYLVAY-treated patients at a rate greater than\u00a0placebo treated patients. If diarrhea occurs with use of BYLVAY, monitor for dehydration and treat promptly. Treatment interruption or discontinuation may be required for persistent diarrhea with no alternate etiology. Fat-Soluble Vitamin (FSV) Deficiency Fat-soluble vitamins (FSV) include vitamin A, D, E, and K. PFIC and ALGS patients can have FSV\u00a0deficiency at baseline, as part of their disease. BYLVAY may affect absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Obtain baseline levels and monitor during treatment, along with any clinical manifestations.\u00a0Supplement if deficiency is observed. If FSV deficiency persists or worsens despite FSV supplementation, discontinue treatment. ADVERSE REACTIONS ALGS: The most common adverse reactions (>5%) are diarrhea, abdominal pain, hematoma, and\u00a0decreased weight. PFIC: The most common adverse reactions (>2%) are diarrhea, liver test abnormalities, vomiting,\u00a0abdominal pain, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency. DRUG INTERACTIONS For patients taking bile acid binding resins, take BYLVAY at least 4 hours before or 4 hours after\u00a0administering, as bile acid binding resins may bind to and reduce BYLVAY efficacy. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS There are no human data on BYLVAY use in pregnant persons to establish a drug-associated risk of\u00a0major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse developmental outcomes. Based on findings from animal reproduction studies, BYLVAY may cause cardiac malformations when a fetus is exposed during pregnancy. There is a pregnancy safety study that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to BYLVAY\u00a0during pregnancy. Pregnant women exposed to BYLVAY, or their healthcare providers, should report\u00a0BYLVAY exposure by calling 1-855-463-5127.

ENDS About PEDFIC 1 and 2 PEDFIC 1 was a 24-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of two doses of odevixibat in reducing pruritus and serum bile acid levels in children with PFIC 1 or 2. PEDFIC 2 is a 72-week open label extension trial, which consisted of children from PEDFIC 1 who received either Bylvay (cohort 1a) or placebo (cohort 1b) and a new cohort (2) of Bylvay-na\u00efve patients of any age and PFIC subtype. PEDFIC is the largest, global, Phase III trial ever conducted in PFIC. PEDFIC 1 (NCT03566238) was a 24-week double-blind, randomized (1:1:1), placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of two doses of odevixibat in reducing pruritus and serum bile acid levels in children with PFIC 1 or 2. Participants were randomly allocated to receive placebo (n=20), odevixibat 40 \u03bcg/kg (n=23), or odevixibat 120 \u03bcg/kg (n=19) once a day. The results were published in The Lancet . 3 PEDFIC 2 (NCT03659916), an open-label extension of PEDFIC 1, is a 72-week trial that aimed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of odevixibat 120 \u00b5g/kg once a day in patients with PFIC. Patients were divided into two cohorts: Cohort 1 (n=56) which consisted of children with PFIC 1 or 2 from PEDFIC 1 who received odevixibat (Cohort 1a: n= 37) or placebo (Cohort 1b: n=19), respectively, and Cohort 2 (n=60) which consisted of newly enrolled, odevixibat-na\u00efve patients of any age and PFIC subtype. Interim results were published in The Journal of Hepatology . 4 About ASSERT and ASSERT-EXT ASSERT (NCT04674761) was a 24-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with an open-label long term extension. ASSERT evaluated the safety and efficacy of 120 \u00b5g /kg once-daily odevixibat vs placebo for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with Alagille syndrome (ALGS). The trial enrolled 52 patients of any age with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of ALGS. The results were published in The Lancet . 5 In ASSERT-EXT (NCT05035030), ASSERT\u2019s ongoing open-label extension, all trial participants received 120 \u03bcg/kg of odevixibat once daily for 72-weeks after the double-blind treatment period completed. In both ASSERT and ASSERT-EXT, the investigators looked for changes in pruritus, serum bile acid concentrations, sleep, and treatment-emergent adverse events.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen\u2019s future ability to achieve its financial targets, which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words \u2018believes\u2019, \u2018anticipates\u2019 and \u2018expects\u2019 and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, including Ipsen\u2019s expectations regarding future events, including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover, the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions, which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future, and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties, notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets, notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore, the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore, Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials, or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to, general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances, new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development, including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen\u2019s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen\u2019s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation, including patent litigation, and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen\u2019s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen\u2019s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen\u2019s business, financial position or performance.

Data at The Liver Meeting (TLM) 2024 Aligos Therapeutics Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 9:30 PM 6 min read In This Article: ALGS -12.52% Aligos Therapeutics SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Nov. 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aligos Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGS, \u201cAligos\u201d), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel therapeutics to address unmet medical needs in liver and viral diseases, today announced positive data from one late-breaker oral and three poster presentations at the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease\u2019s (AASLD) The Liver Meeting (TLM) 2024, being held November 15 \u2013 19, 2024 in San Diego, CA. The clinical poster presentation highlighted the continued potent antiviral activity of ALG-000184 for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus infection in both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative subjects, demonstrating the potential for the molecule to become first-line therapy for chronic suppression and the backbone for regimens aimed at functional cure. Data from \u226484 weeks following an oral daily dose of 300 mg ALG-000184 monotherapy demonstrated sustained HBV DNA suppression (<LLOQ <10 IU/mL) in 7/7 (100%) HBeAg-positive CHB subjects. All HBeAg- subjects achieved sustained HBV DNA suppression by Week 24 and 11/11 (100%) subjects achieved sustained HBV DNA <LLOQ at Week 48 with 10/11 (91%) subjects further achieving HBV DNA below the lower limit of detection (LLOD <4.92 IU/mL). Importantly, no subject demonstrated viral resistance to ALG-000184 monotherapy and suppression was maintained throughout the dosing period. All subjects achieved sustained HBV RNA < LLOQ by Week 44 in HBeAg+ subjects and Week 8 in HBeAg- subjects. Multi-log 10 reductions in HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBcrAg were observed in HBeAg+ subjects, and HBcrAg decline was observed in HBeAg- subjects. In both patient populations, ALG-000184 continues to be well tolerated with no viral breakthrough observed and no known CAM resistant mutations identified with monotherapy treatment. Additionally, the late-breaker oral presentation highlighted the best-in-class potential of ALG-055009, a purpose built THR-\u03b2 agonist discovered by Aligos scientists. 12-weeks of once daily ALG-055009 treatment in MASH patients met the primary endpoint, with robust reductions in liver fat content at Week 12. Doses of 0.5 mg to 0.9 mg ALG-055009 demonstrated statistically significant reductions in liver fat at Week 12, with placebo-adjusted median relative reductions up to 46.2% as measured by MRI-PDFF. Up to 70% of subjects achieved \u226530% relative reduction in liver fat compared to baseline, a positive prognostic indicator of histological improvements in MASH resolution and fibrosis reduction. Eighteen subjects who were on stable GLP-1 agonist therapy qualified for enrollment in the study, with liver fat content meeting the inclusion criteria of \u226510% at baseline as measured by MRI-PDFF. Notably, 11/14 subjects on stable GLP-1 agonists treated with ALG-055009 had liver fat decreases, whereas 4/4 subjects on stable GLP-1 agonists treated with placebo had increases in liver fat over the 12-week dosing period. Story Continues Significant reductions in atherogenic lipids, including LDL-C, lipoprotein (a) and apolipoprotein B and dose-dependent increases in SHBG were observed. In particular, ALG-055009 demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction from baseline of up to 26.8% at Week 12 for lipoprotein (a), which is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease that has been resistant to treatment with statin therapy. Treatment with ALG-055009 was well-tolerated, with rates of gastrointestinal-related AEs similar to placebo. \u201cThe presentation of longer duration dosing of ALG-000184 in CHB patients strengthens our belief that this therapy will become both first-line for chronic suppression as well as the backbone of next generation HBV treatments aimed at functional cure,\u201d stated Lawrence Blatt, PhD, MBA, Chairman, President, & CEO of Aligos Therapeutics. \u201cAdditionally, we are pleased to have presented the HERALD data, showing robust reductions in liver fat for patients treated with ALG-055009. The subgroup analysis in patients enrolled in the study on stable GLP-1 agonist therapy suggests a role for ALG-055009 to augment liver fat reductions in patients receiving incretin therapy.\u201d Details of the presentations are as follows: ALG-000184: Potential first-/best-in-class small molecule CAM-E for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) Abstract #: 1213 Title: Monotherapy with the Capsid Assembly Modulator, ALG-000184, Results in High Viral Suppression Rates in Untreated HBeAg+ and HBeAg- Subjects with Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection Presenter: Professor Man-Fung Yuen, MBBS, MD, PhD, DSc, Chair and Chief of the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Hong Kong Date/Time: November 15, 2024, 8:00am \u2013 5:00pm PT Abstract #: 1266 Title: Capsid Assembly Modulators Such as ALG-001075 Induce Profound HBV DNA Knockdown and Directly Target HBeAg In Vitro Presenter: Cheng Liu, PhD Date/Time: November 15, 2024, 8:00am \u2013 5:00pm PT ALG-055009: Potential best-in-class small molecule THR- \u03b2 for Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH) Format: Oral presentation Title: ALG-055009, a Novel Thyroid Hormone Receptor Beta (THR-\u03b2) Agonist, was Well-tolerated with Significant Reductions in Liver Fat at Week 12 in Non-cirrhotic MASH Patients in the Ongoing Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-controlled Phase 2 Presenter: Rohit Loomba, MD, MHSc, Chief, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of California, San Diego Date/Time: November 19, 2024 at 10:30am \u2013 10:40am PT Abstract #: 3226 Title: Nonclinical Toxicology Profile of ALG-055009, a Novel and Potent Thyroid Hormone Receptor \u03b2 Agonist, for the Treatment of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH) Presenter: Dinah Misner, PhD Date/Time: November 17, 2024, 8:00am \u2013 5:00pm PT The presentations can be found on the Posters & Presentations section\u00a0of the Aligos website ( www.aligos.com ).

It is approved for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with Alagille syndrome (ALGS) in the U.S. three months of age and older and in Europe for patients two months of age and older. It is also approved in the U.S. for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) 12 months of age and older and in Europe for the treatment of PFIC in patients three months of age and older. For more information for U.S. residents, please visit LIVMARLI.com . LIVMARLI has received Breakthrough Therapy designation for ALGS and PFIC type 2 and orphan designation for ALGS and PFIC. LIVMARLI is currently being evaluated in the Phase 3 EXPAND study in additional settings of cholestatic pruritus. To learn more about ongoing clinical trials with LIVMARLI, please visit Mirum\u2019s clinical trials section on the company\u2019s website. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Limitation of Use : LIVMARLI is not for use in PFIC type 2 patients who have a severe defect in the bile salt export pump (BSEP) protein. LIVMARLI can cause side effects, including: Liver injury . Changes in certain liver tests are common in patients with Alagille syndrome and PFIC but can worsen during treatment. These changes may be a sign of liver injury. In PFIC, this can be serious or may lead to liver transplant or death. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests and physical exams before starting and during treatment to check your liver function. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you get any signs or symptoms of liver problems, including nausea or vomiting, skin or the white part of the eye turns yellow, dark or brown urine, pain on the right side of the stomach (abdomen), bloating in your stomach area, loss of appetite or bleeding or bruising more easily than normal. Stomach and intestinal (gastrointestinal) problems. LIVMARLI can cause stomach and intestinal problems, including diarrhea and stomach pain. Your healthcare provider may advise you to monitor for new or worsening stomach problems including stomach pain, diarrhea, blood in your stool or vomiting. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms more often or more severely than normal for you. A condition called Fat Soluble Vitamin (FSV) Deficiency caused by low levels of certain vitamins (vitamin A, D, E, and K) stored in body fat is common in patients with Alagille syndrome and PFIC but may worsen during treatment. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before starting and during treatment and may monitor for bone fractures and bleeding which have been reported as common side effects. US Prescribing Information EU SmPC Canadian Product Monograph About Volixibat Volixibat is an oral, minimally absorbed agent designed to selectively inhibit the ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT). Volixibat may offer a novel approach in the treatment of adult cholestatic diseases by blocking the recycling of bile acids, through inhibition of IBAT, thereby reducing bile acids systemically and in the liver. Volixibat is currently being evaluated in Phase 2b studies for primary sclerosing cholangitis ( VISTAS study ), and primary biliary cholangitis ( VANTAGE study ). In June, Mirum announced positive interim results from the Phase 2b VANTAGE study showing statistically significant improvement in pruritus as well as meaningful reductions in serum bile acids and improvements in fatigue for patients treated with volixibat. No new safety signals were observed, and the most common adverse event was diarrhea with all cases mild to moderate. About CHOLBAM\u00ae (cholic acid) capsules The FDA approved CHOLBAM\u00ae (cholic acid) capsules in March 2015, the first FDA-approved treatment for pediatric and adult patients with bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects, and for adjunctive treatment of patients with peroxisome biogenesis disorder-Zellweger spectrum disorder. The effectiveness of CHOLBAM\u00ae has been demonstrated in clinical trials for bile acid synthesis disorders and the adjunctive treatment of peroxisomal disorders. An estimated 200 to 300 patients are current candidates for therapy. CHOLBAM\u00ae (cholic acid) Indication CHOLBAM is a bile acid indicated for Treatment of bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects. Adjunctive treatment of peroxisomal disorders, including Zellweger spectrum disorders, in patients who exhibit manifestations of liver disease, steatorrhea, or complications from decreased fat-soluble vitamin absorption. LIMITATIONS OF USE The safety and effectiveness of CHOLBAM on extrahepatic manifestations of bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects or peroxisomal disorders, including Zellweger spectrum disorders, have not been established. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2013 Exacerbation of liver impairment Monitor liver function and discontinue CHOLBAM in patients who develop worsening of liver function while on treatment. Concurrent elevations of serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) may indicate CHOLBAM overdose. Discontinue treatment with CHOLBAM at any time if there are clinical or laboratory indicators of worsening liver function or cholestasis. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (\u22651%) are diarrhea, reflux esophagitis, malaise, jaundice, skin lesion, nausea, abdominal pain, intestinal polyp, urinary tract infection, and peripheral neuropathy. Please see full Prescribing Information for additional Important Safety Information. About Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare, progressive and underdiagnosed disorder of cholesterol metabolism affecting many parts of the body. In people with CTX, the body is unable to break down cholesterol properly causing toxins (e.g., cholestanol and bile alcohols) to build up throughout the body over time. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive genetic manner. Signs and symptoms of CTX include neonatal cholestasis (jaundice or bile flow interruption), chronic diarrhea, the development of bilateral cataracts before the age of 18, development of tendon xanthomas (fatty deposits in the tendons) during teenage years or later, and neurologic deterioration. The types, combinations and severity of symptoms can be different from person to person making diagnosis challenging and often delayed. About chenodiol tablets Chenodiol tablets is another name for chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). CDCA is a naturally occurring bile acid that was originally approved for the treatment of people with radiolucent stones in the gallbladder. More recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted chenodiol orphan drug designation for cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). CTX is a rare progressive disorder that can affect the brain, spinal cord, tendons, eyes and arteries. Chenodiol is not yet indicated for the treatment of CTX but has received a medical necessity determination in the U.S. by the FDA. About Mirum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
