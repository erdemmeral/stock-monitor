Completed enrollment in Phase 2 BESTOW trial assessing tegoprubart in kidney transplantation four months ahead of schedule; on track to report topline results in fourth quarter of 2025 Presented updated data on 13 participants from ongoing Phase 1b trial that continue to support safety and tolerability of tegoprubart for prevention of organ rejection in kidney transplantation Announced positive initial data from first three subjects with type 1 diabetes treated with tegoprubart as part of immunosuppression regimen following islet transplantation in investigator-initiated trial at UChicago Medicine Completed two financings totaling $135 million in combined gross proceeds, with funds expected to support operations through end of 2026 IRVINE, Calif., Jan. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eledon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\u201cEledon\u201d) (Nasdaq: ELDN) today announced a summary of 2024 accomplishments and provided guidance for anticipated 2025 business milestones. \u201c2024 was a transformative year for Eledon as we achieved multiple key clinical milestones for tegoprubart across kidney, islet cell, and xenograft transplantation,\u201d said David-Alexandre C. Gros, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Eledon. \u201cMoreover, the data we reported reinforced the potential of tegoprubart to be a best-in-class immunosuppression therapy to prevent transplant rejection and disrupt the current standard of care. We now look forward to another pivotal year ahead.\u201d 2024 Key Highlights Completed enrollment of 120 patients in the Phase 2 BESTOW clinical trial approximately four months earlier than originally planned. The Phase 2 trial is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of tegoprubart for the prevention of organ rejection in patients undergoing kidney transplantation. Presented updated data at the American Transplant Congress (ATC) from the ongoing Phase 1b open-label trial evaluating tegoprubart for the prevention of organ rejection in kidney transplant patients. Updated data from 13 participants demonstrated that tegoprubart was generally safe and well tolerated, with an overall mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 70.5 mL/min/1.73m 2 at all reported time points after day 30 post-transplant. Two participants completed more than 12 months on therapy post-transplant, and both demonstrated mean eGFRs above 90 mL/min/1.73m 2 at one-year post-transplant. Announced positive initial data for the first three islet transplant recipients treated with tegoprubart as part of an immunosuppression regimen for the prevention of islet transplant rejection in subjects with type 1 diabetes in an investigator-initiated trial at the University of Chicago Medicine\u2019s Transplant Institute. The data demonstrated potentially the first human cases of insulin independence achieved using an anti-CD40L monoclonal antibody immunosuppression therapy without the use of tacrolimus, the current standard of care for prevention of transplant rejection. Announced the use of tegoprubart as part of the immunosuppression treatment regimen used following the first-ever kidney xenotransplant procedure of a genetically modified pig kidney to a human. Completed two financings for combined total gross proceeds of $135.0 million, before deducting any offering related expenses, which is anticipated to support company operations to the end of 2026. Story Continues Anticipated 2025 Milestones Summer 2025: Report updated interim clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1b and long-term efficacy extension studies of tegoprubart in kidney transplantation. 4Q 2025: Report topline results from the Phase 2 BESTOW trial of tegoprubart in kidney transplantation. 2025: Report longer-term follow up results from the investigator-led clinical trial at UChicago Medicine Transplant Institute for pancreatic islet transplantation in subjects with type 1 diabetes involving use of tegoprubart as part of immunosuppression regimen.

individual investors who hold 57% were hit as were institutions editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Thu, Nov 14, 2024, 2:08 PM 4 min read In This Article: ELDN -1.33% Key Insights Eledon Pharmaceuticals' significant individual investors ownership suggests that the key decisions are influenced by shareholders from the larger public 43% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Institutional ownership in Eledon Pharmaceuticals is 20% Every investor in Eledon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( NASDAQ:ELDN ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 57% stake, individual investors possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk). While institutions, who own 20% shares weren\u2019t spared from last week\u2019s US$48m market cap drop, individual investors as a group suffered the maximum losses Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Eledon Pharmaceuticals, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Eledon Pharmaceuticals NasdaqCM:ELDN Ownership Breakdown November 14th 2024 What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Eledon Pharmaceuticals? Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. Eledon Pharmaceuticals already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Eledon Pharmaceuticals' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. NasdaqCM:ELDN Earnings and Revenue Growth November 14th 2024 Our data indicates that hedge funds own 11% of Eledon Pharmaceuticals. That's interesting, because hedge funds can be quite active and activist. Many look for medium term catalysts that will drive the share price higher. BVF Partners L.P. is currently the largest shareholder, with 11% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are RA Capital Management, L.P. and Frazier Life Sciences Management, LP, with an equal amount of shares to their name at 6.0%. On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too. Story Continues Insider Ownership Of Eledon Pharmaceuticals While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Eledon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$288m, and the board has only US$124k worth of shares in their own names. We generally like to see a board more invested. However it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public Ownership The general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, collectively holds 57% of Eledon Pharmaceuticals shares. With this amount of ownership, retail investors can collectively play a role in decisions that affect shareholder returns, such as dividend policies and the appointment of directors. They can also exercise the power to vote on acquisitions or mergers that may not improve profitability. Private Equity Ownership With a stake of 12%, private equity firms could influence the Eledon Pharmaceuticals board. Some investors might be encouraged by this, since private equity are sometimes able to encourage strategies that help the market see the value in the company. Alternatively, those holders might be exiting the investment after taking it public. Next Steps: I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should learn about the 6 warning signs we've spotted with Eledon Pharmaceuticals (including 4 which are significant) .

Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Wed, Nov 13, 2024, 12:01 AM 9 min read In This Article: ELDN -1.33% Eledon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Completed enrollment of Phase 2 BESTOW trial of tegoprubart in kidney transplantation four months ahead of schedule; on track to report topline results in fourth quarter of 2025 Announced positive initial data from first three subjects with type 1 diabetes treated with tegoprubart as part of immunosuppression regimen following islet transplantation in investigator-initiated trial at UChicago Medicine Announced oversubscribed $85 million underwritten offering, with proceeds expected to extend cash runway to the end of 2026 IRVINE, Calif., Nov. 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eledon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\u201cEledon\u201d) (Nasdaq: ELDN) today reported its third quarter 2024 operating and financial results and reviewed recent business highlights. \u201cWe believe tegoprubart has best-in-class potential as a novel immunosuppressive treatment option to prevent transplant rejection, with promising clinical results across kidney, xenograft, and now islet transplantations,\" said David-Alexandre C. Gros, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Eledon. \u201cRecent encouraging data from the UChicago Medicine trial in type 1 diabetes, combined with our accelerated enrollment in the Phase 2 BESTOW trial and our strong capital position following our recent oversubscribed financing, has put us in a strong position to advance tegoprubart\u2019s development. We look forward to sharing results from our BESTOW trial in the fourth quarter of 2025.\u201d Recent Business Highlights Completed enrollment for the Phase 2 BESTOW clinical trial, which is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of tegoprubart for the prevention of organ rejection in patients undergoing kidney transplantation. The trial reached its target enrollment of 120 participants approximately four months earlier than originally planned. Announced positive initial data for the first three islet transplant recipients treated with tegoprubart as part of an immunosuppressive regimen for the prevention of islet transplant rejection in subjects with type 1 diabetes in an investigator-initiated trial at the University of Chicago Medicine\u2019s Transplantation Institute. The first two subjects achieved insulin independence and remain insulin free, with glucose control in the normal range; the third subject was recently transplanted and remains on a trajectory to also achieve insulin independence. Treatment with tegoprubart was generally well tolerated in all subjects with no unexpected adverse events. The data demonstrated potentially the first human cases of insulin independence achieved using an anti-CD40L monoclonal antibody immunosuppressive therapy without the use of tacrolimus, the current standard of care for prevention of transplant rejection. Completed an oversubscribed, underwritten offering of common stock and pre-funded warrants for total gross proceeds of $85.0 million, or net proceeds of approximately $79.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses. The offering, which priced at a premium, included participation from both new and existing leading healthcare investors. Story Continues Anticipated Upcoming Milestones Mid-2025: Report updated interim clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1b and long-term safety and efficacy extension studies of tegoprubart in kidney transplantation. 4Q 2025: Report topline results from the Phase 2 BESTOW trial of tegoprubart in kidney transplantation. 2025: Report longer-term follow up from the investigator-led clinical trial with the UChicago Medicine Transplant Institute for pancreatic islet transplantation in subjects with type 1 diabetes. Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $78.2 million as of September 30, 2024, which does not include net proceeds of approximately $79.5 million received in the October 2024 underwritten offering. The company expects current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with the net proceeds from the October 2024 underwritten offering, to fund operations to the end of 2026. Research and development (R&D) expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $16.5 million, compared to $7.9 million\u00a0for the comparable period in 2023, an increase of\u00a0$8.6 million. The increase was primarily driven by a rise in clinical development expenses related to the Phase 1b and Phase 2 BESTOW studies, an increase in employee compensation and benefits related to increased headcount, and greater chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC)\u00a0expenses related to the production of clinical trial materials. General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $4.0 million, compared to $3.3 million\u00a0for the comparable period in 2023, an increase of\u00a0$0.7 million. The increase was primarily driven by a rise in professional services and an increase in general operating expenses. Net income for the third quarter of 2024 was $77.0 million, or $1.05 per basic share, compared with a net loss of $9.9 million, or $0.33 per basic share,\u00a0for the comparable period in 2023, an increase of\u00a0$86.9 million. The increase in net income was primarily driven by a non-cash gain of $96.4 million related to changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities and the fair value of financial instruments issued in excess of proceeds, recorded in the third quarter ending September 30, 2024. Excluding this gain, the company would have recorded a net loss of $19.5 million for the third quarter of 2024.
