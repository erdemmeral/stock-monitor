Predicts Up to ~930% Rally for These 2 \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 Stocks TipRanks Sun, Jan 12, 2025, 2:05 PM 7 min read In This Article: INMB -3.94% BDTX -6.49% The S&P 500 wrapped up the first full week of 2025 on a sour note, as December\u2019s labor market data surprised to the upside. U.S. employers added 256,000 jobs last month, significantly outpacing economists\u2019 forecast of 155,000. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate dropped to 4.1%, better than the anticipated 4.2%. Stay Ahead of the Market: Discover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using Tipranks' Stock Screener This robust jobs report underscores the continued strength of the U.S. labor market and the broader economy. However, while this resilience is encouraging, it also raises concerns that the Federal Reserve may adopt a more cautious approach to interest rate cuts this year due to persistent inflationary pressures. Looking ahead, Larry Adam, Chief Investment Officer at Raymond James, has taken a deep dive into current conditions, examining both the headwinds and tailwinds, and lays out a case for the bulls. \u201cFor the second year in a row, equity markets demonstrated powerful though uneven growth and the U.S. economy remained resilient, despite some dents in the armor. The corporate earnings outlook remains healthy, and while still above target levels, inflation has declined \u2013 even if in fits and starts. There are clearly perceivable risks \u2013 inflation, consumer spending, investor confidence, international trade \u2013 but the outlook for 2025 is positive,\u201d Adam opined. Against this backdrop, Raymond James stock analysts have spotlighted two small-cap stocks with the potential to skyrocket by as much as 930% in the coming year. Using the TipRanks database , we\u2019ve looked at the big-picture view on both of these picks, and it seems the rest of the Street agrees with the Raymond James take \u2013 both are rated Strong Buys by the analyst consensus. Let\u2019s dive into what makes these hidden gems stand out. Black Diamond Therapeutics (BDTX) Heading Raymond James\u2019 picks is Black Diamond Therapeutics, a biopharmaceutical company operating at the clinical stage and taking a novel precision oncology approach to developing oncological treatments. While most cancer drugs target specific mutations that cause or are found in tumors, Black Diamond targets families of oncogenic mutations through its MasterKey approach. This strategy has the potential to broaden the patient base and develop drug candidates with wide applications. At the core of this innovation is Black Diamond\u2019s flagship drug candidate, BDTX-1535, a brain-penetrant MasterKey inhibitor targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Currently undergoing human clinical trials, BDTX-1535 is being developed for three key indications: second- and third-line non-small cell lung cancer (2L/3L NSCLC), first-line NSCLC, and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Story Continues In its 2L/3L NSCLC trial, the company delivered positive initial Phase 2 results in September of last year. The data was based on two patient cohorts; one with relapsed/refractory patients harboring non-classical EGFR mutations, and the other with C797S resistance mutations. Across both groups, BDTX-1535 demonstrated robust anti-tumor activity. The company anticipates providing a clinical update and obtaining regulatory feedback in the first quarter of 2025. Black Diamond is also testing BDTX-1535 as a first-line therapy for NSCLC patients with non-classical EGFR mutations. Initial results from this ongoing trial are expected in the first quarter of 2025, and the company is optimistic that the encouraging activity observed in recurrent settings will translate into significant clinical benefits for newly diagnosed patients. The potential doesn\u2019t end there. Black Diamond is exploring the potential of BDTX-1535 in battling glioblastoma (GBM), one of the most aggressive brain cancers. Phase 1 data, presented last June, came from a dose-escalation trial in recurrent GBM patients and revealed promising signs. The drug not only demonstrated a strong safety and tolerability profile but also achieved significant anti-tumor activity. The drug was able to pass through the blood/brain barrier, and reached clinically meaningful levels in brain tumor tissues. Considering the potential of BDTX-1535, the upcoming catalysts, and the company\u2019s current share price of $1.93, Raymond James analyst Laura Prendergast views BDTX stock as deeply undervalued. \u201cWe remain highly optimistic for 1Q25 clinical updates of BDTX-1535 in EGFRm NSCLC (2/3L updated data and first 1L data in patients with non-classical EGFR mutations)\u2026 [We] maintain our belief that numerous features of BDTX-1535 in NSCLC are being underappreciated by investors\u2026 We model BDTX-1535 hitting blockbuster status in FY31 and global peak sales of ~$1.8B in FY35. Based on our projections BDTX is significantly undervalued versus its smid-cap biotech peer group,\u201d Prendergast opined. Just how undervalued? Prendergast rates BDTX an Outperform (i.e., Buy), with a $20 price target implying a substantial one-year upside potential of ~930%. (To watch Prendergast\u2019s track record, click here ) Overall, it\u2019s clear that Wall Street agrees with Prendergast\u2019s assessment. BDTX stock has 4 recent analyst reviews on record, all of which rate it as a Buy, resulting in a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. Adding to the optimism, the average price target of $15.67 implies a ~712% upside potential. (See BDTX stock forecast ) INmune Bio ( INMB ) Next up is INmune Bio, a clinical-stage biotech company that adopts an innovative approach to drug development by leveraging the patient\u2019s innate immune system to, as the company describes it, \u2018fight disease and help the body heal itself.\u2019 INmune focuses on prioritizing patient benefits and aligning the drug mechanism of action with the underlying biological metrics of the target patient population. Following this approach, INmune has developed a clinical trial pipeline featuring XPro, the company\u2019s leading drug candidate. XPro represents the next generation of precision-targeted therapeutic agents, designed to neutralize tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a driver of innate immune dysfunction and chronic inflammation. Importantly, the drug does not interfere with the normal functions of TNF, which are essential for tissue repair. This specificity enhances both the drug\u2019s effectiveness and safety. Currently, XPro is being studied as a treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, with enrollment in the Phase 2 clinical trial completed last November. The trial, dubbed AD02, is a global, blinded, randomized study involving 208 patients. The study focuses on patients with early Alzheimer\u2019s as well as biomarkers of elevated neuroinflammation. The drug candidate targets glial cells, key drivers of neuroinflammation in the brain, aiming to reduce neurodegeneration and demyelination while improving synaptic function and remyelination. The study\u2019s primary endpoint is an improvement in baseline cognitive function after 24 weeks of treatment. Topline results from this study are expected during 2Q25. Meanwhile, XPro is also stepping into the challenging field of treatment-resistant depression. INmune is leading a Phase 2 NIH-backed trial involving 90 participants with inflammatory biomarkers. Over six weeks, patients will receive either XPro or a placebo as researchers track changes in brain activity using functional MRI, focusing on pathways linked to depression and inflammation. XPro may take center stage as INmune\u2019s most advanced program, but it\u2019s not the company\u2019s only asset. INKmune, an innovative therapy targeting metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, is showing significant potential. In the ongoing Phase I/II trial, it has delivered strong safety results and increased NK-cell activity in the first dosing cohort. With Phase II enrollment projected to conclude by Q2 2025, the program continues to progress. The optimism surrounding INmune\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s program, in particular, has captured the attention of Raymond James analyst Gary Nachman, who writes: \u201cWith enrollment of the XPro Ph2 in early Alzheimer\u2019s (AD) complete, key focus is on the topline data expected in 2Q25. Management remains optimistic in a positive outcome given several elements of the Ph2 design (inflammatory biomarker enrichment, EMACC primary endpoint, 24-week duration) and quality data collection that should help de-risk the trial. Positive Ph2 data in early AD would be the key value creating catalyst, validating INMB\u2019s novel approach targeting neuroinflammation in AD and unlocking potential partnership opportunities for a larger Ph3 program.\u201d To this end, Nachman rates INMB an Outperform (i.e., Buy), along with an $18 price target that indicates his confidence in a 12-month gain of 228%. (To watch Nachman\u2019s track record, click here ) The rest of the Street appears to echo Nachman\u2019s sentiment. With 5 unanimous Buy recommendations, INMB earns a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target of $20.60 indicates an impressive upside potential of 275%.

Know Zacks Equity Research Wed, Dec 11, 2024, 8:00 PM 3 min read Investors might want to bet on Black Diamond (BDTX), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices. The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Black Diamond is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price. Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock. For Black Diamond, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher. Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>. Story Continues Earnings Estimate Revisions for Black Diamond This company is expected to earn -$1.30 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2024, which represents a year-over-year change of 30.9%. Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Black Diamond. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 7%. Bottom Line Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term. You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>> The upgrade of Black Diamond to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.
