7 min read GraniteShares NEW YORK, Dec. 31, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a reverse share split for one of its ETFs. The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of the transaction. Reverse split will be executed on GraniteShares 2x Short TSDD Daily ETF . After the close of the markets on January 10, 2025 (the \u201cPayable Date\u201d), the Fund will effect a reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: Fund Name Ticker Reverse Split Ratio Approximate decrease in total number of outstanding shares GraniteShares 2x Short TSDD Daily ETF TSDD 1 for 20 95 % Please note the CUSIP change, effective January 13, 2025: Fund Name Current CUSIP New CUSIP GraniteShares 2x Short TSDD Daily ETF 38747R 769 38747R 595 As a result of the reverse split, every twenty shares of the Fund will be exchanged for one share of the Fund. Accordingly, the\u00a0total number of the issued and outstanding shares for the Fund will decrease by the approximate percentage indicated\u00a0above, while the per Share net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d) and opening market price will be approximately twenty-times\u00a0higher. Shares of the Fund will begin trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market (the \u201cNASDAQ\u201d) on a split-adjusted\u00a0basis on January 13, 2025. The Fund\u2019s total market value, and thus a shareholder\u2019s investment\u00a0value, will not be affected by the reverse split. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical one-for-twenty reverse\u00a0split anticipated for the Fund: 1-for-20 Reverse Split Period # of Shares Owned Hypothetical NAV Total Market Value Pre-Reverse Split 1,000 $ 1 $ 1,000 Post-Reverse Split 50 $ 20 $ 1,000 Redemption of Fractional Shares and Tax Consequences of the Reverse Split As a result of the reverse split, a shareholder of the Fund\u2019s shares potentially could hold a fractional share. However, fractional\u00a0shares cannot trade on the NASDAQ. Thus, the Fund will redeem for cash a shareholder\u2019s fractional shares at the Fund\u2019s\u00a0split-adjusted NAV as of the Effective Date. Such redemption may have tax implications for those shareholders and a shareholder\u00a0could recognize a gain or loss in connection with the redemption of the shareholder\u2019s fractional shares. Otherwise, the\u00a0reverse split will not result in a taxable transaction for holders of Fund shares. No transaction fee will be imposed on shareholders\u00a0for such redemption. The GraniteShares ETF Trust\u2019s transfer agent will notify the Depository Trust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d) of the reverse split and instruct DTC to adjust\u00a0each shareholder\u2019s investment(s) accordingly. DTC is the registered owner of the Fund\u2019s shares and maintains a record of\u00a0the Fund\u2019s record owners.

For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about the Funds, please call (844) 476 8747 or visit www.graniteshares.com . Read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by more traditional mutual funds. PRINCIPAL FUND RISKS (see the Prospectus for more information) GraniteShares Leveraged Long and Inverse Daily ETFs are not suitable for all investors. The funds seek daily leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. The funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives, which means that the funds are riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage because the fund magnifies the performance of the underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect the fund return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. Investors who do not understand the Funds, or do not intend to actively manage their funds and monitor their investments, should not buy the Funds. The Funds are designed to be utilized only by traders and sophisticated investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily inverse and/or leveraged investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and/or short sales and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Funds will lose money if the underlying stock\u2019s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Funds will lose money even if the underlying stock\u2019s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The Funds track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification that most mutual funds and exchange-traded funds offer. Although the Funds will be listed and traded on an exchange, an investment in a Fund may not be suitable for every investor. The Funds pose risks that are unique and complex. This information is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Funds to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.

MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY \"We are excited to share our first business update with investors since our initial public offering in early October,\" said Stephen Preston, FrontView\u2019s Chairman, Co-CEO, and Co-President. \"While our third quarter results still reflect our private company predecessor, we\u2019re able to provide meaningful updates on our growing and robust pipeline of accretive acquisitions. We\u2019re kicking off the first quarter as a publicly traded company with a solid balance sheet, low leverage, and ample liquidity to fund our growth trajectory.

Story Continues REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO As of September 30, 2024, we owned a diversified portfolio of 278 individual net leased commercial properties, comprising approximately 2.1 million rentable square feet of operational space. As of September 30, 2024, all but three of our properties were subject to a lease, and our properties were occupied by 293 different commercial tenants, with no single tenant accounting for more than 3.4% of our annualized base rent (\"ABR\"). Properties subject to a lease represent 98.9% of the number of properties in our portfolio. The ABR weighted average lease term and ABR weighted average annual minimum rent increase, pursuant to leases on properties in the portfolio as of September 30, 2024, was 6.7 years and 1.7%, respectively. Subsequent to quarter-end, we acquired eight new properties totaling $22.5 million. The acquisitions closed had a weighted average cash capitalization rate of 8.0% and a weighted average lease term of 13.3 years. As of the date of this release, we have $81.4 million of acquisitions under Purchase and Sale contract (\"PSA\") that are subject to normal course due diligence and customary closing conditions. We expect to close in excess of $75.0 million of acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2024. The acquisitions under PSA include 31 properties spread across six industries, 34 tenants, and 18 states. BALANCE SHEET AND CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITIES As of September 30, 2024, we had total Gross Debt of $419.5 million, Net Debt of $409.6 million, a Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre ratio of 9.8x, and a Pro Forma Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre ratio of 3.9x. On October 3, 2024, we completed our initial public offering, selling 14.3 million shares at $19.00 per share, inclusive of the underwriters additional purchase of 1.09 million shares subject to their option. Concurrent with our initial public offering, we closed on a new $250 million revolving credit facility and a new $200 million delayed draw term loan, providing additional sources of debt funding. We used the proceeds from our initial public offering to repay our prior CIBC revolving credit facility and CIBC term loan, pay financing transaction costs on the new revolving credit facility and new delayed draw term loan, and retained $82.3 million of cash to be used for acquisitions and general corporate purposes. Using the initial public offering proceeds and new sources of debt funding, we anticipate repaying our $253.2 million ABS Notes when they mature in December 2024. DISTRIBUTIONS At its November 12, 2024 meeting, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.215 per common share and OP unit to holders of record as of December 31, 2024, payable on or before January 15, 2025. 2024 GUIDANCE For the fourth quarter of 2024, FVR expects to report AFFO of between $0.32 and $0.34 per diluted share. The guidance is based on the following key assumptions: (i)\u00a0investments in real estate properties in excess of $75 million; and (ii) total cash general and administrative expenses of approximately $2.1 million. Our per share results are sensitive to both the timing and amount of real estate investments, property dispositions, and capital markets activities that occur throughout the quarter. We do not provide guidance for the most comparable GAAP financial measure, net income, or a reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure of AFFO to net income computed in accordance with GAAP, because it is unable to reasonably predict, without unreasonable efforts, certain items that would be contained in the GAAP measure, including items that are not indicative of our ongoing operations, including, without limitation, potential impairments of real estate assets, net gain/loss on dispositions of real estate assets, changes in allowance for credit losses, and stock-based compensation expense. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on our GAAP results for the guidance periods.

Notice Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to our reported results and net earnings per diluted share, which are financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release contains and may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Funds from Operations (\"FFO\"), Adjusted Funds from Operations (\"AFFO\"), Pro Forma AFFO, Net Debt, Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre, and Pro Forma Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre. We believe the use of FFO, AFFO, and Pro Forma AFFO are useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs. FFO, AFFO, and Pro Forma AFFO should not be considered alternatives to net income as a performance measure or to cash flows from operations, as reported on our statement of cash flows, or as a liquidity measure, and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. We believe presenting Pro Forma Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre is useful to investors because it provides information about gross debt less cash and cash equivalents, which could be used to repay debt, compared to our performance as measured using Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre. You should not consider our Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre as an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and statements of why management believes these measures are useful to investors are included below.

We also disclose FFO and AFFO, each of which are non-GAAP measures. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs. FFO and AFFO should not be considered alternatives to net income as a performance measure or to cash flows from operations, as reported on our statement of cash flows, or as a liquidity measure, and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. We compute FFO in accordance with the standards established by the Board of Governors of Nareit. Nareit defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains (losses) from sales of certain depreciated real estate assets, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, and impairment charges related to certain previously depreciated real estate assets. FFO is used by management, investors, and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers, primarily because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. To derive AFFO, we modify the Nareit computation of FFO to include other adjustments to GAAP net income related to certain non-cash or non-recurring revenues and expenses, including straight-line rents, cost of debt extinguishments, amortization of lease intangibles, amortization of debt issuance costs, amortization of net mortgage premiums, (gain) loss on interest rate swaps and other non-cash interest expense, realized gains or losses on foreign currency transactions, Internalization expenses, structuring and public company readiness costs, extraordinary items, and other specified non-cash items. We believe that such items are not a result of normal operations and thus we believe excluding such items assists management and investors in distinguishing whether changes in our operations are due to growth or decline of operations at our properties or from other factors. We use AFFO as a measure of our performance when we formulate corporate goals. We believe that AFFO is a useful supplemental measure for investors to consider because it will help them to better assess our operating performance without the distortions created by one-time cash and non-cash revenues or expenses. Our leases typically include cash rents that increase through lease escalations over the term of the lease. Our leases do not typically include significant front-loading or back-loading of payments, or significant rent-free periods. Therefore, we find it useful to evaluate rent on a contractual basis as it allows for comparison of existing rental rates to market rental rates. We further exclude costs or gains recorded on the extinguishment of debt, non-cash interest expense and gains, the amortization of debt issuance costs, net mortgage premiums, and lease intangibles, realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, Internalization expenses, and structuring and public company readiness costs, as these items are not indicative of ongoing operational results. FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other REITs, and comparisons of our FFO and AFFO with the same or similar measures disclosed by other REITs may not be meaningful. Neither the SEC nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments to FFO that we use to calculate AFFO. In the future, the SEC, Nareit or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the REIT industry and in response to such standardization we may have to adjust our calculation and characterization of AFFO accordingly. The following is a reconciliation of historical and pro forma net income to EBITDA, EBITDAre, and Adjusted EBITDAre, debt to Net Debt and Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: For the three months ended September 30, Pro Forma Historical Historical (unaudited, in thousands) 2024 2024 2023 Net loss $ (1,764 ) $ (3,339 ) $ (4,895 ) Depreciation and amortization 7,537 7,542 6,475 Share of 50/50 Joint Venture's depreciation and\u00a0amortization \u2014 \u2014 594 Interest expense 4,269 6,463 4,611 Share of 50/50 Joint Venture's interest expense \u2014 \u2014 523 Income taxes 63 63 48 Share of 50/50 Joint Venture's income taxes \u2014 \u2014 9 EBITDA $ 10,105 $ 10,729 $ 7,365 (Gain) loss on sale of real estate \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Share of 50/50 Joint Venture's gain on sale of real estate \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 EBITDAre $ 10,105 $ 10,729 $ 7,365 Adjustment for non-cash compensation expense (1) 986 \u2014 \u2014 Adjustment to exclude non-recurring expenses (income) (2) (747 ) (307 ) 2,501 Adjusted EBITDAre 10,344 10,422 9,866 Annualized EBITDAre 40,420 42,916 29,460 Annualized adjusted EBITDAre 41,376 41,688 39,464 (1) Reflects an adjustment to exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense.

We define Net Debt as our total debt less cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. The ratios of Net Debt to EBITDAre and Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre represent Net Debt as of the end of the applicable period divided by EBITDAre or Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre for the period, respectively. We believe that these ratios are useful to investors and analysts because they provide information about Gross Debt less cash and cash equivalents, which could be useful to repay debt, compared to our performance as measured using EBITDAre and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre. We compute EBITDA as earnings before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is a measure commonly used in our industry. We believe that this ratio provides investors and analysts with a measure of our leverage that includes our operating results unaffected by the differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles and useful life of related assets compared to other companies in our industry. In 2017, Nareit issued a white paper recommending that companies that report EBITDA also report EBITDAre in financial reports. We compute EBITDAre in accordance with the definition adopted by Nareit. Nareit defines EBITDAre as EBITDA (as defined above) excluding gains (loss) from the sales of depreciable property and provisions for impairment on investment in real estate. We believe EBITDA and EBITDAre are useful to investors and analysts because they provide important supplemental information about our operating performance exclusive of certain non-cash and other costs. EBITDA and EBITDAre are not measures of financial performance under GAAP, and our EBITDA and EBITDAre may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should not consider our EBITDA and EBITDAre as alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. We compute adjusted EBITDAre as EBITDAre for the applicable quarter, as adjusted to (i) reflect all investment and disposition activity that took place during the applicable quarter as if each transaction had been completed on the first day of the quarter, (ii) exclude certain GAAP income and expense amounts that we believe are infrequent and unusual in nature because they relate to unique circumstances or transactions that had not previously occurred and which we do not anticipate occurring in the future, (iii) eliminate the impact of lease termination fees from certain of our tenants, and (iv) exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Annualized adjusted EBITDAre is calculated by multiplying adjusted EBITDAre for the applicable quarter by four, which we believe provides a meaningful estimate of our current run rate for all of our investments as of the end of the most recently completed quarter given the contractual nature of our long term net leases. You should not unduly rely on this measure as it is based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to be inaccurate. Our actual reported EBITDAre for future periods may be significantly different from our annualized adjusted EBITDAre. Our actual reported EBITDAre for future periods may be significantly different from our Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre. Adjusted EBITDAre and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre are not measurements of performance under GAAP, and our Adjusted EBITDAre and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should not consider our Adjusted EBITDAre and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre as alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP.
