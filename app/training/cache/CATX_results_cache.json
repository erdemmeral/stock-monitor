Gastrointestinal Cancer Trial, Stock Soars On Friday, Perspective Therapeutics, Inc. (NYSE: CATX ) revealed updated interim results from its ongoing Phase 1/2a trial of [212Pb]VMT-\u03b1-NET . The data will be presented at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium. The company\u2019s trial included patients with unresectable or metastatic somatostatin receptor type 2 expressing neuroendocrine tumors who have not received prior radiopharmaceutical therapy and whose tumors have shown radiological evidence of disease progression in the 12 months before enrollment. Also Read: Positive Outlook For Novartis As Company Capitalizes On Growing Treatment Opportunities, Analyst Highlights Since the study\u2019s start, no dose-limiting toxicities, grade 4 or 5 treatment-emergent adverse events, or serious adverse events have been reported. No new grade 3 adverse events (AEs) have been observed besides the two previously reported events. No decline in renal function was observed. Hematologic AEs such as decreased lymphocyte count and anemia were all grades 1 and 2. No treatment discontinuations due to AEs have occurred. Further anti-tumor activities have been observed\u00a0with a longer follow-up. As of the data cut-off date of January 10, 2025, there were two unconfirmed responses and one confirmed response, as in Cohort 2. The patient who experienced a confirmed objective response has been in response for 17 weeks and remains in the study. One patient was observed to experience an initial (unconfirmed) response in the fifth scan after their first dose, the first scan conducted after the end of their treatment period. This patient experienced gradual tumor regression throughout the study, with the magnitude of change meeting the criteria for response on their most recent scan. A third patient was observed to experience an initial (unconfirmed) response in the seventh scan after their first dose and the third scan was conducted after the end of their treatment period. Five patients continue to have stable disease. One patient was deemed to have progressive disease after one dose by unambiguous progression of non-target lesions.

Updated interim results with an additional 10 weeks of follow-up on the nine patients in Cohorts 1 (2.5 mCi) and Cohort 2 (5.0 mCi) of the ongoing Phase 1/2a study support continuation of dose-finding for [ 212 Pb]VMT-\u03b1-NET [ 212 Pb]VMT-\u03b1-NET continued to have a favorable safety profile, with no dose-limiting toxicities observed at the two doses tested Three of seven patients in Cohort 2 experienced investigator-assessed objective responses as defined by RECIST v1.1. First responses for two patients occurred after end of treatment period and are subject to confirmation, in addition to the previously reported patient with confirmed response who remains in response The five other patients in Cohorts 1 and 2 who previously experienced stable disease remain in stable disease SEATTLE, Jan. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Perspective Therapeutics, Inc. (\u201cPerspective\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NYSE AMERICAN: CATX), a radiopharmaceutical company that is pioneering advanced treatment applications for cancers throughout the body, announced updated interim results from its ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial of [ 212 Pb]VMT-\u03b1-NET that are being presented as a poster presentation at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium (ASCO-GI) taking place January 23-25, 2025 in San Francisco, CA. This Phase 1/2a clinical trial is a multi-center open-label dose escalation and dose expansion study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT05636618 ) of [ 212 Pb]VMT-\u03b1-NET in patients with unresectable or metastatic somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2) expressing neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) who have not received prior radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) and whose tumors have shown radiological evidence of disease progression in the 12 months prior to enrollment. Two patients in Cohort 1 and seven patients in Cohort 2 received [ 212 Pb]VMT-\u03b1-NET treatment prior to Cohort 2 being reopened in August 2024. These patients were enrolled for dose limiting toxicities observations. Initial results as of a data cut-off date of October 31, 2024 were previously presented at the 2024 North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (NANETS) Multidisciplinary NET Medical Symposium in November 2024. As of the data cut-off date for the ASCO-GI poster presentation of January 10, 2025, all nine patients had completed treatments per the study protocol, and at least one scan for all patients after their final treatments was available to the study team. Safety findings : No dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), grade 4 or 5 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs) have been reported since the start of the study. No new grade 3 adverse events (AEs) have been observed aside from the two events that were previously reported. No decline in renal function was observed. Hematologic AEs such as decreased lymphocyte count and anemia were all grades 1 and 2. No treatment discontinuations due to AEs have occurred. Further anti-tumor activities have been observed with longer follow-up. As of the data cut-off date of January 10, 2025, there were two unconfirmed responses and one confirmed response as defined by RECIST v1.1 in Cohort 2. Story Continues The patient who experienced a confirmed objective response has been in response for 17 weeks and remains in the study. This patient received the first two [ 212 Pb]VMT-\u03b1-NET doses at administered dose of 5.0 mCi (equivalent to 84.6 \u00b5Ci/kg), then received the remaining two doses at the next lower activity level of 2.5 mCi (equivalent to 42.4 \u00b5Ci/kg) due to an adverse event that was determined by the investigator to be unrelated to [ 212 Pb]VMT-\u03b1-NET. One patient was observed to experience an initial (unconfirmed) response in the fifth scan after their first dose, which was the first scan conducted after the end of their treatment period. This patient experienced gradual tumor regression throughout the study, with the magnitude of change meeting the criteria for response on their most recent scan. This patient received four doses of 5.0 mCi (equivalent to 68.7 \u00b5Ci/kg) of [ 212 Pb]VMT-\u03b1-NET. A third patient was observed to experience an initial (unconfirmed) response in the seventh scan after their first dose, which was the third scan conducted after the end of their treatment period. This patient received four doses of 5.0 mCi (equivalent to 31.7 \u00b5Ci/kg) of [ 212 Pb]VMT-\u03b1-NET. Gradual tumor regression was first observed in the fifth scan after their first dose, with the magnitude of change meeting the criteria for response on their most recent scan. Five patients continue to have stable disease. One patient was deemed to have progressive disease after one dose under RECIST v1.1, by unambiguous progression of non-target lesions. As stated in our August 12, 2024 business update for the second quarter of 2024, the observation period was completed for dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in seven patients enrolled in Cohort 2 during the second quarter of 2024. Subsequently, the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) determined that safety observations during the DLT period supported proceeding with dose escalation to Cohort 3 and increasing the number of patients dosed at 5 mCi (up to 40 more patients). Based on FDA interactions prior to the initiation of patient dosing in this study, which occurred in November 2023, the decision to open Cohort 3 will follow consultation and alignment with the agency. Once we have alignment, we will communicate to stakeholders regarding how the study will proceed. In December 2024, we submitted data from 2 patients in Cohort 1 and seven patients from Cohort 2 to the FDA. As previously announced, since Cohort 2 reopened for enrollment in August 2024 and through year end 2024, an additional 11 patients have been dosed. A total of 18 patients have been dosed in Cohort 2 as of December 31, 2024. \"I am excited to see a signal of deepening of anti-tumor activity for [ 212 Pb]VMT-\u03b1-NET at the dose level used in Cohort 2 with longer follow-up, while [ 212 Pb]VMT-\u03b1-NET remains well-tolerated,\" said Richard L. Wahl, MD, Professor of Radiology, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology at Washington University School of Medicine. \u201cI look forward to sharing these results with a broader physician community at ASCO-GI and participating in the continuation of this study.\u201d Markus Puhlmann, Chief Medical Officer of Perspective, commented, \u201cThe dose finding study for [ 212 Pb]VMT-\u03b1-NET is progressing well, with robust participation in the re-opened Cohort 2. In keeping with the commitment we made to the FDA prior to the start of dosing in this study, we commenced engagement with the FDA to pursue dose escalation while continuing to enroll patients into Cohort 2. An update will be provided once alignment is reached with the agency.\u201d Thijs Spoor, Chief Executive Officer of Perspective, commented, \u201cAs we continue to advance as a clinical-stage oncology company, we will be able to apply learnings from our lead clinical programs to new programs and potential new medicines based on our next generation targeted radiopharmaceutical technology platform. Meanwhile, in-sourcing clinical operations and other functions allows us to execute better and share clinical updates regularly with key stakeholders. We look forward to making progress in advancing our clinical pipeline and supporting infrastructure to serve more patients.\u201d Perspective will webcast a conference call on Friday, January 24, 2025 at 8:00 am ET to discuss the data to be presented at the ASCO-GI symposium. Webcast details are available on the Events page of the Company's website. The lead investigator of the study, Richard L. Wahl, MD (Professor of Radiology, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology at Washington University School of Medicine) will participate, along with members of Perspective's management team. A live question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. About VMT-\u03b1-NET VMT-\u03b1-NET is a clinical-stage, targeted alpha-particle therapy (TAT) radiopharmaceutical being developed for the treatment and diagnosis of patients with somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2) expressing neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), which are a rare and difficult-to-treat type of cancer. VMT-\u03b1-NET incorporates Perspective's proprietary lead-specific chelator (PSC) to bind 203 Pb for SPECT imaging, and 212 Pb for alpha-particle therapy. Perspective is conducting a multi-center open-label dose escalation, dose expansion study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT05636618 ) of [ 212 Pb]VMT-\u03b1-NET in patients with unresectable or metastatic SSTR2-positive NETs who have not received prior radiopharmaceutical therapies (RPT). Perspective received Fast Track Designation for this program from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) based on preclinical data for SSTR2-positive NETs regardless of prior treatment response. Perspective is also collaborating with a number of thought leaders to further elucidate the clinical profile of [ 212 Pb]VMT-\u03b1-NET through investigator-initiated studies in the U.S. as well as overseas. About Neuroendocrine Tumors Neuroendocrine tumors form in cells that interact with the nervous system or in glands that produce hormones. They can originate in various parts of the body, most often in the gut or the lungs and can be benign or malignant. Neuroendocrine tumors are typically classified as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors or non-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. According to cancer.net, it is estimated that more than 12,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with a NET each year. Importantly, neuroendocrine tumors are associated with a relatively long duration of survival compared to other tumors and as a result, there are over 170,000 people living with this diagnosis. 1 About Perspective Therapeutics, Inc.

Morgan Healthcare Conference on Wednesday, January 15, 2025, at 3:45 p.m. PT SEATTLE, Jan. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Perspective Therapeutics, Inc. (\"Perspective,\" the \"Company,\" \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour\u201d) (NYSE AMERICAN: CATX), a radiopharmaceutical company that is pioneering advanced treatment applications for cancers throughout the body, today announced strategic priorities for the next 12-18 months. \u201c2025 is just the beginning of the next chapter for our team and the patients we serve,\u201d said Thijs Spoor, Perspective's CEO. \u201cWe are well on our way in our transformation into a clinical-stage company. Each program in our pipeline is designed with a patient-first approach, offering the potential to redefine standards of care and make a meaningful impact on lives around the world. We look forward to expanding our pipeline of potential new medicines based on our next generation targeted radiopharmaceutical technology platform while building the manufacturing infrastructure to enable broader availability of our medicines, so we may serve many more patients.\u201d Advancing the current clinical pipeline VMT- \u03b1 -NET We are conducting a multi-center open-label dose escalation, dose expansion study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT05636618 ) of [ 212 Pb]VMT-\u03b1-NET in patients with unresectable or metastatic somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2)-positive neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) who have not received prior radiopharmaceutical therapies (RPT). As stated in our August 12, 2024 business update for 2Q 2024, the observation period was completed for dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in seven patients enrolled in Cohort 2 during the second quarter of 2024. Subsequently, the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) determined that safety observations during the DLT period supported proceeding with dose escalation to Cohort 3 and increasing the number of patients dosed at 5 mCi (up to 40 more patients). Story Continues Based on FDA interactions prior to the initiation of patient dosing in this study, which occurred in November 2023 , the decision to open Cohort 3 will follow consultation and alignment with the agency. Once we have alignment, we will communicate to stakeholders regarding how the study will proceed. In December 2024, we submitted data from 2 patients in Cohort 1 and seven patients from Cohort 2 to the FDA. Since Cohort 2 reopened for enrollment in August 2024 and through year end 2024, an additional 11 patients have been dosed. A total of 18 patients have been dosed in Cohort 2. Results from the study have been accepted as a poster presentation at the ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium ( ASCO-GI ) taking place on January 23-25, 2025 in San Francisco, CA. ASCO-GI plans to release further details for regular abstracts on January 21, 2025. Initial results as of a data cut-off date of October 31, 2024 were presented at the 2024 North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (NANETS) Multidisciplinary NET Medical Symposium in November 2024. Safety findings : No dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed among any patients. No grade 4 or 5 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed. Two grade 3 adverse events (AEs) - one case of diarrhea and one case of syncope - were observed. No decline in renal function was observed. Hematologic AEs such as decreased lymphocyte count and anemia were all grades 1 and 2. No treatment discontinuations due to AEs have occurred. Clinical activity has been observed with treatment. Eight of nine patients had durable control of disease. Six of nine patients had measurable reduction of tumor volume, one of whom had a confirmed response as defined by RECIST v1.1. The patient who experienced an objective response received the first two doses at 84.6 \u00b5Ci/kg per dose, then received the remaining two doses at a reduced activity level of 42.4 \u00b5Ci/kg. One patient was deemed to have progressive disease after one dose under RECIST v1.1, by unambiguous progression of non-target lesions. VMT01 VMT01 is a MC1R-targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) that can be radiolabeled with either 203 Pb for patient selection and dosimetry assessments, or 212 Pb for alpha particle therapy. We are conducting a multi-center, open-label dose escalation, dose expansion study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT05655312 ) in previously treated patients with histologically confirmed melanoma and MC1R-positive imaging scans. Initial results at data cut-off date of September 4, 2024 were presented at the 21 st International Congress of the Society for Melanoma Research (SMR) in October 2024 Safety findings : No dose-limiting toxicities were observed among any patients, and no adverse events led to treatment discontinuation. Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mostly Grades 1 and 2. None of the four cases of grade 3 TEAEs were deemed to be treatment related. There were no grade 4 or 5 TEAEs. No renal toxicities had been reported as of October 11, 2024 (there were no clinically significant changes in blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine) in spite of dosimetry estimated renal radiation that approached the higher end of conventional dosing. Efficacy findings : All patients in Cohort 1 completed three treatments, with one patient experiencing an unconfirmed RECIST version 1.1 objective response after completion of treatment, and two patients experiencing stable disease at 9 and 11 months from the start of treatment, respectively. In Cohort 2, patients progressed after either the first cycle (three patients) or the second cycle (four patients). These findings are consistent with published and ongoing preclinical studies showing immunostimulatory effects at lower radiation doses. The SMC reviewed these findings and recommended exploring a lower dose level of 1.5 mCi per dose, both as a single agent and in combination with the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab. The SMC's recommendation would allow for the monotherapy and combination cohorts to proceed concurrently. Both cohorts are open for enrollment. PSV359 We designed PSV359 to target and deliver 212 Pb to tumor sites expressing fibroblast activation protein-\u03b1, or FAP-\u03b1, associated with a variety of solid tumors. Preclinical imaging and therapy as well as human imaging results suggest our proprietary targeting ligand has improved levels of target engagement and uptake in tumors and reduced retention in healthy tissues that may result in a desirable therapeutic index. We filed an IND in late 2024 for this new asset. If the study may proceed, site activation activities will follow, with the study potentially open for enrollment around mid-2025. Adding to the clinical pipeline Our discovery team is preparing four additional novel assets for first-in-human imaging this year. If and when those assets meet our criteria for further development, we plan to proceed with pre-IND filing activities. Updates to cash runway and cash position Based on preliminary, unaudited estimates, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance was approximately $227.8 million as of December 31, 2024. We expect this balance to be sufficient to fund our current planned operations and capital investments into late 2026. The update to our estimated cash runway is based on the combination of additional benefits of in-sourcing clinical operations and other functions, more disciplined capital allocation and enhanced visibility into the size and timing of capital expenditures related to our manufacturing facilities. 43 rd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference Thijs Spoor, CEO of Perspective, will present at the 43rd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference on Wednesday, January 15, 2025, at 3:45 p.m. PT (6:45 p.m. ET), followed by a Q&A session with a broader group of senior management. A live audio webcast of the presentation and Q&A will be available on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at www.perspectivetherapeutics.com. A replay will also be archived for 90 days on the Investor Center section of the site. About Perspective Therapeutics, Inc.

Affan Mir Sat, Nov 16, 2024, 9:26 AM 5 min read In This Article: CATX -7.04% We recently published a list of 10 Best Multibagger Stocks To Buy Heading into 2025 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Perspective Therapeutics, Inc. (NYSE:CATX) stands against other best multibagger stocks. November has been an eventful month so far for the market as the Fed cut rates by a quarter percentage and president-elect, Donald Trump won the election for the second time. The market reacted positively to these events as the major indices touched all-time highs and even Bitcoin finally broke off its shell after many months, reaching an all-time high of $93,000. More recently, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that solid economic growth, low unemployment, and inflation above 2% mean there\u2019s no urgency to cut interest rates. Speaking in Dallas, Powell said inflation is on a path toward the Fed's 2% target, allowing for cautious policy adjustments. He highlighted the economy's strong fundamentals but acknowledged persistent inflation pressures. While a rate cut is expected by the market in December, it anticipates fewer cuts next year due to steady inflation and policy uncertainties. According to the CME FedWatch, 62.4% of the interest rate traders expect a 25 bps rate cut in December. However, in January, 55.5% of the market anticipates the rates to remain the same after the December cut. Powell emphasized that the Fed will monitor inflation closely, especially housing costs, as it aims to reach its target sustainably.

Election Boosts Market Optimism but Risks Remain Stuart Kaiser, Citi's head of equity trading strategy recently joined CNBC\u2019s Closing Bell . In the post-election discussion, Kaiser expressed a generally optimistic outlook, with confidence that the markets have cleared the immediate uncertainties related to the election. Kaiser noted a temporary boost from this event but emphasized that moving forward, market focus will return to U.S. economic growth, the Fed\u2019s actions, and corporate earnings. While he believes valuations are currently more justifiable with expected growth from deregulation and new policy changes, he remains cautious about risks tied to bond market movements and rising yields. He suggested that rising yields linked to economic growth are manageable for equities, but warned against yields climbing due to fiscal or tariff issues, which could unsettle the market. Regarding equity strategy, Kaiser advocated a cautious approach to small-cap investments, preferring high-quality, profitable small caps due to their domestic focus, which could shield them from trade policy risks impacting larger companies. Additionally, although Kaiser doesn't handle non-traditional assets directly, he acknowledged that assets like Bitcoin might gain traction in a strong economic or supportive policy environment.

Our Methodology For this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to identify over 350 stocks with share price gains of over 100% in the last 12 months, as of November 13. Next, we narrowed our list to 28 stocks with share price gains of 200% either in the last 12 or 24 months and Buy or better ratings from analysts. From that list, we removed the stocks that had negative share price returns compared to 24 months ago and finally narrowed the list to 10 stocks with an average analyst price target upside of over 100%. The 10 best multi-bagger stocks are listed in ascending order of their average price target upside. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ( see more details here ). Perspective Therapeutics, Inc. (NYSE: CATX ) 1-Year Share Price Performance: ~330% 2-Year Share Price Performance: ~250% Average Price Target Upside: 106.39% Perspective Therapeutics, Inc. (NYSE:CATX) is advancing radiopharmaceutical treatments targeting cancer cells using the alpha-emitting isotope 212Pb. Through proprietary technology, the company aims to deliver precise radiation to cancer cells, using targeting agents that improve accuracy. Additionally, it is developing imaging diagnostics with the same targeting mechanisms to personalize treatments, combining both visualization and therapy in a \"theranostic\" approach to enhance effectiveness and reduce side effects. Currently, the company\u2019s melanoma (VMT01) and neuroendocrine tumor (VMT-\u03b1-NET) programs are undergoing Phase 1/2a trials, and the company has created a proprietary 212Pb generator to support clinical and commercial needs. On November 13, Justin Walsh of JonesTrading reaffirmed his Buy rating on Perspective (NYSE:CATX). Walsh expects the company\u2019s upcoming presentation on its Phase 1/2a trial of Pb-212-VMT-\u03b1-NET at a medical symposium to underline its potential in treating neuroendocrine tumors, especially those not previously treated with radiotherapy. Although still in the dose-escalation stage, early trial data shows promise in distinguishing this treatment in the field. The company\u2019s ongoing Phase 1/2a trial for advanced melanoma has also demonstrated encouraging anti-tumor effects, despite a few clinical uncertainties. The therapy\u2019s safety profile is notable, with no significant kidney toxicity seen even at higher doses. Perspective (NYSE:CATX) increased its cash and short-term investments to $267.8 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $9.2 million at the end of 2023. This funding is projected to support current clinical programs, pre-IND assets, and regional manufacturing development, extending financial stability through mid-2026. Overall, CATX ranks 9th on our list of\u00a0 best multibagger stocks to buy heading into 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of CATX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.
