[{"text": "Coupang Insiders Sold US$10m Of Shares Suggesting Hesitancy editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 4:00 PM 3 min read In This Article: CPNG The fact that multiple Coupang, Inc. ( NYSE:CPNG ) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more. Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Coupang The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Coupang Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chief Financial Officer, Gaurav Anand, for US$4.6m worth of shares, at about US$22.75 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$22.56. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign. Insiders in Coupang didn't buy any shares in the last year.

(CPNG) the Most Promising Growth Stock According to Wall Street Analysts? Maleha Afzal Sun, Jan 26, 2025, 8:52 PM 5 min read In This Article: CPNG We recently published a list of 12 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Wall Street Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Coupang, Inc. (NYSE:CPNG) stands against other most promising growth stocks according to Wall Street analysts. Strategist Believes the Street is Underestimating the Tech Sector The new regulatory environment has the technology sector eyeing prominent growth opportunities in 2025 and beyond. Big Tech is set to release earnings next week and investors are excited to see how the group performed in the last quarter. On January 24, Dan Ives, managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, appeared in an interview on Morning Brief at Yahoo Finance to share his 2025 outlook for the tech sector. Ives suggested that the Street is underestimating the potential of Big Tech and advises investors to \u201cgrab popcorn\u201d for the earnings week ahead. He also shared his optimism towards the billion-dollar investments made by the group before 2025 and claimed that the \u201cfourth industrial revolution\u201d has just begun. He also suggested that AI spending by companies heavily depends on the use cases for the company, and emphasized the unique selling point for each of the names in mega-cap tech names. Ives stated that the ability to monetize stall bases has been the crucial factor driving the growth among tech names, which happens to mimic what the hyperscalers have done. Ives emphasized that investments in artificial intelligence are now going to play out on the consumer side and remained confident that Big Tech is a step ahead in terms of the AI journey to monetization. He believes that seeing the return on investment play out, the Street is underestimating the growth in the tech sector, not just for the earnings next week but for 2025 as a whole. He also suggested that the regulatory environment is drastically changing especially in favor of the autonomous vehicles market and expects a massive year ahead for the segment and stocks associated with self-driving technologies and autonomous vehicle driving. The year ahead looks super solid for companies in the growth sector, namely artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, biotechnology, fintech, and software. While most of it is because of the efforts made by these names over the past year, the promising regulatory environment is going to boost the position of these stocks significantly. Our Methodology We used Finviz to look for companies operating in growth sectors such as technology, financials (fintech), biotech, and communication services. We only focused on companies with a market cap of at least $2 billion. We then examined the analyst upside surrounding 25 stocks and picked the 12 stocks with the highest upside as of January 23, 2025. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. Story Continues Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ( see more details here ). Is Coupang, Inc. (CPNG) the Most Promising Growth Stock According to Wall Street Analysts? A woman holding a laptop, wearing a graphic t-shirt, casually checking her e-commerce order. Coupang, Inc. (NYSE: CPNG ) Analyst Upside as of January 23, 2025: 41% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56 Coupang, Inc. (NYSE:CPNG) is a technology company that provides retail, restaurant delivery, video streaming, and fintech services to customers around the world under the brands Coupang, Coupang Eats, and Coupang Play, to name a few. The company leverages technology to predict unexpected spikes in demand, allowing it to meet customer demand no matter the conditions. In addition to that, Coupang\u2019s (NYSE:CPNG) proprietary robots can manage and sort orders in seconds, without having to carry and lift items. In the third quarter of 2024, CPNG generated $7.9 billion in net revenues, up by 27% year-over-year. In addition to that, net income was worth $64 million and gross profit was up by 45% year-over-year. Its product commerce revenue made up most of the revenue, reaching $6.9 billion, up by 16% year-over-year. Similarly, active customers for its product commerce segment hit 22.5 million, up by 11% from the same period in 2023. Through its innovations, CPNG has managed to deliver cost savings, reduce wastage, and predict demand. This explains why analysts are bullish on the stock with their median price target representing an upside of 41% from current levels. Appalaches Capital stated the following regarding Coupang, Inc. (NYSE:CPNG) in its Q3 2024 investor letter : \u201cA new core holding of the portfolio that may appear confusing is Coupang, Inc. (NYSE:CPNG). Coupang mainly provides a first-party marketplace in South Korea and Taiwan that is similar to Amazon here in the U.S. Coupang additionally has other digital services such as Coupang Play (streaming), Coupang Eats (food delivery), and Coupang Pay (payments). Coupang has a dominant position in South Korean e-commerce, with nearly half of the population represented as an active customer on the platform. At first glance, the company appears marginally profitable and very expensive against current earnings, so it certainly appears to be an outlier against the rest of the portfolio.\u201d Overall, CPNG ranks 8th on our list of most promising growth stocks according to Wall Street analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of CPNG to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool Sun, Jan 26, 2025, 4:19 PM 4 min read In This Article: CPNG ^GSPC UPST There's no question the bull market is alive and well. The S&P 500 jumped more than 50% over the two-year period of 2023-24, the first time it's done that since the dot-com era, and stocks are off to a hot start in 2025 as well. Through Jan. 22, the broad-market index is up 3%, and it just hit another all-time high. While pretty much any investor should be happy with the kind of returns the S&P 500 has delivered over the last two years, there are opportunities for more growth. Keep reading to see two stocks that look like good candidates to double this year. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Coupang Coupang (NYSE: CPNG) may not be a household name in the U.S., but it is in South Korea, where it's the leading e-commerce platform. In fact, Coupang is following a similar playbook to Amazon , going from a direct online seller and then layering on more profitable, complementary businesses like a third-party marketplace, food delivery, and video streaming. It's also launched a similar service to Amazon Prime called Rocket Wow, helping to lock in customers. Thus far, Coupang has delivered solid growth, but it's yet to earn much credit from the market. That could change soon, though. First, the company is delivering solid growth on the top and bottom lines. Revenue in the third quarter was up 27%, or 32% on a currency-neutral basis, to $7.9 billion, and gross margin improved by 350 basis points to 28.8% thanks to improvements in both its core e-commerce business and newer offerings. Management touted increased efficiencies, greater utilization of technology and automation, supply chain improvements, and the scaling of its higher-margin businesses. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( EBITDA ) in the quarter rose 44% to $343 million. Coupang also trades at a reasonable valuation at a price-to-sales ratio of 1.4, and the South Korean market is a good fit for its business, as its high density and fast internet speed make delivery easy and help services like video streaming. If it maintains its strong revenue growth and its margins continue to expand, the stock will be rewarded by investors. It could see a point of inflection in 2025. 2. Upstart Another candidate for a doubling this year is Upstart Holdings (NASDAQ: UPST) , the artificial intelligence (AI)-based lender that soared during the pandemic but is still down sharply. However, Upstart has gained traction since bottoming out, and the stock is up significantly since then, stabilizing even as interest rates have remained elevated and loan demand has been weak. Story Continues That could start to change this year. First, the Federal Reserve is still forecasting two rate cuts, and Treasury yields have been elevated since Trump was elected due to investor nervousness about policies that could be inflationary, like tariffs and mass deportation. If inflation continues to come down, interest rates are likely to fall, benefiting Upstart. Upstart has also made internal improvements that set the company up for a new round of growth, as it's secured funding for its loans, which are typically funded through partners; has strengthened its balance sheet; and has streamlined its cost basis after a series of layoffs. The lending platform showed some signs of recovery in its third-quarter earnings report, with revenue up 20% to $162 million. Its volume of loans originated rose 30% year over year to 188,149, or $1.6 billion, and conversion improved dramatically, up from 9.5% to 16.3%. The company credited a new model, Model 18, with improving its conversion rate by making its forecasts more accurate, a key step to driving revenue growth. Upstart also sees continued revenue growth in the fourth quarter, and it could accelerate in 2025 and turn the company profitable, especially if interest rates come down. Upstart is a volatile stock, but it has the components to soar this year as it builds on the improvements in its model and benefits from an improving macro environment.

(CPNG) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know Zacks Equity Research Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 5:00 PM 5 min read In This Article: CPNG Coupang, Inc. (CPNG) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future. Shares of this company have returned -3.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.5% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Coupang belongs, has gained 4.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Earnings Estimate Revisions Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. Coupang is expected to post a loss of $0.01 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -112.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -7.7%. The consensus earnings estimate of -$0.02 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -107.7%. This estimate has changed -7.1% over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.57 indicates a change of +2,908.4% from what Coupang is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -6.6%. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Coupang. Story Continues The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: 12 Month EPS Revenue Growth Forecast Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial. For Coupang, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.21 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +25.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $30.51 billion and $35.46 billion estimates indicate +25.1% and +16.2% changes, respectively. Last Reported Results and Surprise History Coupang reported revenues of $7.87 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.2%. EPS of $0.06 for the same period compares with $0.05 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.84 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.37%. The EPS surprise was +200%. Over the last four quarters, Coupang surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period. Valuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance. Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is. As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Coupang is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. Bottom Line The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coupang. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
