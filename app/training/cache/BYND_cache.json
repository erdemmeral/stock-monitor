Several factors are contributing to the burgeoning alternative meat industry. The most important of these is environmental sustainability. Alternative meats, particularly plant-based options, are recognized for their lower environmental impact compared to traditional meat. A study by the Food Foundation, quoted by prominent British newspaper The Guardian, found that plant-based meat alternatives result in fewer greenhouse gas emissions and require less water. Another factor contributing to alternative meat popularity is health considerations. The same study noted that plant-based alternatives often contain fewer calories, less saturated fat, and more fiber than conventional meat products. However, it also highlighted that some alternatives may have higher salt content and lack certain nutrients like iron and vitamin B12. Innovations in food technology have led to the development of lab-grown meats, offering solutions to ethical and environmental issues associated with traditional meat production. The cultivated meat industry is projected to be valued at $25 billion globally by 2030. Despite the positive trajectory, the alternative meat industry faces several challenges. These include production costs, consumer acceptance, and nutritional fortification, among others. With increasing investments, technological innovations, and a growing consumer base seeking sustainable and healthy food options, the industry is set to play a significant role in the future of food production.

Sensera as Medical Advisor NewMediaWire Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 3:30 PM 7 min read In This Article: BCAN LOS ANGELES - January 22, 2025 ( NEWMEDIAWIRE ) - Femto Technologies Inc. (Nasdaq: BCAN ) (\" Femto \" or the \" Company \"), a FemTech pioneer and the creator of Sensera , a feminine wellness product, today announced that Dr. Alexandra Dubinskaya has joined the company as Medical Advisor for the Sensera brand. Dr. Dubinskaya is a Urogynecologist and Reconstructive Pelvic Surgeon at Cedars Sinai in Los Angeles and a Sexual Medicine Specialist with expertise in menopause and pelvic health. Femto's Sensera Combines Intelligent Design, Innovative Technology and Data Driven Insights to Create Its Smart Feminine Wellness Device. Sensera's Medical Advisor, Urogynecologist, Reconstructive Pelvic Surgeon, and Sexual Medicine Specialist, Dr. Alexandra Dubinskaya, said: \"Sexual wellness is an essential component of overall well-being. Yet, many people are unaware of how to navigate changes in their sexual lives as they age or face health challenges. Sensera is the first sexual wellness product to leverage AI to help users better understand and adjust to these changes, ultimately improving quality of life and intimate experiences.\" Dr. Dubinskaya, along with her colleagues, conducted research highlighting the positive impact vibrating devices can have on sexual function and pelvic floor conditions*. She explained: \"Our study demonstrated that vibrating devices could significantly improve sexual function over time. We observed a marked reduction in bothersome symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse, as well as lower pain scores. Additionally, patients with lichen sclerosus showed noticeable improvements in lesion appearance, and the severity of vaginal atrophy decreased. Depression rates were also significantly reduced, underscoring the holistic benefits these devices can offer.\" The findings underscore Femto's mission to integrate innovation with care, empowering individuals to take charge of their intimate health and well-being. \"We are thrilled to welcome Dr. Dubinskaya to the Sensera team,\" said Yftah Ben Yaackov, CEO of Femto. \"Her unparalleled knowledge and expertise in the area of sexual function, menopause and pelvic floor health is an asset to the company and to the women who are looking to Sensera to provide intelligent products that bridge the gap between pleasure and wellness.\" Femto's proprietary technology enables Sensera, a FemTech device, to provide a unique experience designed to adapt to a woman's changing needs over time. Sensera features the brand's proprietary technology, Smart Release System (SRS), along with biofeedback sensors, machine learning and artificial intelligence, personalizing the feminine usability experience and enhancing comfort. Story Continues How It Works: Sensera's feminine wellness device is made from soft, medical-grade silicone and features a Y-shaped, ergonomic design. Women can choose a capsule (pleasure or wellness) and insert one of the interchangeable pods into the device with a simple twist. Once the session starts, Sensera's proprietary SRS technology utilizes biofeedback sensors that track key body metrics, heart rate, and pelvic floor muscle contractions, to adapt to women's personal needs and preferences. A corresponding iOS app enables users to create personal customized programs, enhancing its performance and ability to \"build\" on previous sessions. Under strict privacy protocols, women have the choice to support women's wellness by sharing their likes, dislikes and feedback to create better, more personalized wellness programs for all. Sensera also offers device-only mode and machine learning-only use. Sensera's AI capabilities are designed to become more advanced in correlation to the increased volume of users and magnitude of fed data. Sensera's feminine wellness device includes a charging cable, storage sachet, quick start guide and three interchangeable pods: two pleasure; one wellness. It will be available for pre-order in Q1 at www.senserawellness.com . Additional capsules can be purchased separately as a one-time order or via subscription. Pre-orders are scheduled to ship early Q2 2025.

The Motley Fool Tue, Jan 7, 2025, 8:01 AM 3 min read In This Article: BYND Shares of Beyond Meat (NASDAQ: BYND) fell 24.5% in December, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence . The plant-based meat company continues to slide as the world trends away from its products. The company posted solid revenue growth last quarter but continues to lose money. After these losses, Beyond Meat stock is now down 98% from its all-time highs. Here's why the stock was falling yet again in December. Rising revenue, but heavy losses Beyond Meat's goal was to build a fake meat product that could persuade meat eaters to switch to plant-based alternatives. For a few years, it looked as if the company was making progress on this goal when revenue reached $450 million in 2022. But then things started to go downhill. Beyond Meat's revenue started to shrink as the hype around plant-based alternatives faded, along with a backlash against its large ingredients list. That led to a huge free cash flow burn and the stock price collapse. Today. the company has made some progress improving these losses, but it's still burning over $100 million in free cash flow a year with stagnating revenue. Revenue was up slightly last quarter but is still down significantly over the past 12 months compared with its all-time high of $450 million. Importantly, the company has never generated a profit. Continued pessimism and data around the interest in plant-based meat probably had Beyond Meat's stock in the tank in December, and throughout 2024. Even with growth stocks soaring, the hype around Beyond Meat stock has finally run out. It's now heavily shorted, with an estimated short interest of close to 50% as of this writing. Should you buy Beyond Meat stock? Contrarians might think it smart to buy some shares of Beyond Meat stock right now. It's a leading brand in its space and has a market cap of just $250 million. However, in this case, it's hard to see how a turnaround happens for Beyond Meat. The company has never earned a profit, is barely growing, and has a weak gross margin of just 17.7%. Even though it has greatly cut its operating costs to try to save money, free cash flow is still negative-$100 million each year. Stay far away from Beyond Meat stock. If it can never generate a profit, it will never generate any value for shareholders and the stock will keep heading lower and lower.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our 9 Best Market-Beating Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Hidden Gem Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Leading Femtech Product: Sensera NewMediaWire Mon, Jan 6, 2025, 4:00 PM 7 min read In This Article: BCAN LAS VEGAS - January 6, 2025 ( NEWMEDIAWIRE ) - Femto Technologies Inc. (Nasdaq: BCAN ) (\" Femto \" or the \" Company \"), a Femtech pioneer and the creator of Sensera , a feminine wellness product, has been honored by the CES Innovation Awards(R) 2025 in the AI category. Femto's Sensera, an Advanced Feminine Wellness Device, Leverages its AI and Machine Learning Technology to Achieve Enhanced Comfort and Wellness with a Unique Personalization Experience. The CES Innovation Awards(R) 2025 program received a record number of submissions over 3400. The CES Innovation Awards program, owned and produced by the Consumer Technology Association (CTA)(R), is an annual competition honoring outstanding design and engineering in 33 consumer technology product categories. An elite panel of industry expert judges, including members of the media, designers, engineers, and more, reviewed submissions based on innovation, engineering and functionality, aesthetic, and design. Femto's proprietary technology enables Sensera, a fem-tech device, to provide a unique experience designed to adapt to a woman's changing needs over time, using AI, machine learning and biofeedback sensors. Sensera features the brand's proprietary technology, Smart Release System (SRS) along with biofeedback sensors, machine learning and artificial intelligence, personalizing the feminine usability experience, bridging the gap between wellness and pleasure. Product and additional capsules are available for pre-order now on the company's website . \"We are honored to be recognized in the AI category by CES Innovation Awards,\" said Yftah Ben Yaackov, CEO of Femto. \"We have been working tirelessly to embed Femto's state-of-the-art technology in Sensera, our feminine wellness device that we are proud to bring to market.\" Sensera's Medical Advisor, Urogynecologist, Reconstructive Pelvic Surgeon, and Sexual Medicine Specialist, Dr. Alexandra Dubinskaya, said: \"Sensera is on a mission to use technology to listen to a woman's body and adapt to her changing needs. Understanding that there are strong connections between pleasure and wellness (including the connection between the physical and the emotional) and how they relate to overall intimacy experience is not something brands and device creators generally understand. Today that changes thanks to Femto's Sensera.\" How It Works: Sensera's feminine wellness device is made from soft, medical-grade silicone and features a Y-shaped, ergonomic design. Women can choose a capsule (pleasure or wellness) and insert one of the interchangeable pods into the device with a simple twist. Once the session starts, Sensera's proprietary SRS technology utilizes biofeedback sensors that track key body metrics, heart rate, and pelvic floor muscle contractions, to adapt to women's personal needs and preferences. Story Continues A corresponding iOS app enables users to create personal customized programs, enhancing its performance and ability to \"build\" on previous sessions. Under strict privacy protocols, women have the choice to support women's wellness by sharing their likes, dislikes and feedback to create better, more personalized wellness programs for all. Sensera also offers device-only mode and machine learning-only use. Sensera's AI capabilities are designed to become more advanced in correlation to the increased volume of users and magnitude of fed data. Sensera's feminine wellness device includes a charging cable, storage sachet, quick start guide and three interchangeable pods: two pleasure; one wellness. It will be available for pre-order in Q1 at www.senserawellness.com . Additional capsules can be purchased separately as a one-time order or via subscription. Pre-orders are scheduled to ship early Q2 2025. The CES Innovation Awards 2025 honorees, including product descriptions and photos, can be found at CES.tech/innovation.

Despite challenges, including higher input costs and increased operational expenses, Tyson Foods, Inc. , Pilgrim's Pride Corp. and Beyond Meat, Inc. remain well-positioned for growth, supported by their strategic initiatives and ability to keep pace with shifting consumer preferences. About the Industry The Zacks Food \u2013 Meat Products industry comprises companies that manufacture, process, market, distribute and sell a wide range of meat products like chicken, pork, beef, prepared food and plant-based meats. Some companies also offer poultry and turkey products, alongside providing nutritional food products and supplements, desserts and drink mixes and industrial gelatin products. Most companies offer their products to retail and foodservice customers, while some cater to deli and commercial operators, including grocery retailers, grocery wholesalers, meat distributors, warehouse club stores, industrial food processing companies, chain restaurants, international export companies, school cafeterias and hospitals, among others. Some products offered include frozen whole chicken, primary pork cuts, salads, sandwiches and meatballs. Major Trends Shaping the Future of the Meat Food Industry Increasing Protein Demand & the Rise of Plant-Based Alternatives: The growing popularity of protein-rich diets is driving growth for meat companies, prompting them to continuously innovate their product lines. This trend is fueled by heightened health awareness, particularly among fitness enthusiasts adopting high-protein regimens such as the keto diet. At the same time, the demand for plant-based meat alternatives is gaining traction as consumers increasingly favor fresher, healthier options over traditional meat products. These alternatives are appreciated for their minimal use of artificial ingredients and additives, making them a more wholesome choice. Industry experts believe that plant-based protein could significantly disrupt the traditional meat industry, positioning itself as a formidable contender in the broader protein market. Story Continues Strategic Expansions: Companies in the meat industry are strengthening their market presence by diversifying product offerings and executing strategic growth initiatives, such as mergers, acquisitions and capacity expansions. To enhance production capabilities, many are investing in new facilities, upgrading existing plants and forming partnerships with co-manufacturers. Several companies are also investing in automation and advanced technology to accelerate digital transformation and streamline operations. Some companies are focusing on expanding into international markets, where they are seeing favorable outcomes and strong growth potential. Rising Cost Challenges: Elevated input costs continue to pose significant challenges for meat producers. Escalating prices for feed, raw materials, transportation and labor have driven up production expenses. Persistent inflationary pressures, combined with higher operational costs, remain a headwind to maintaining healthy profit margins.

Securities Lending Revenue Down 10% YoY to $9.64 Billion PR Newswire Thu, Jan 2, 2025, 11:30 PM 2 min read Lending revenue dips against backdrop of record-high indices NEW YORK , Jan. 2, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The global securities finance industry generated $9.64 billion in revenue for lenders in 2024, according to DataLend, the market data service of fintech EquiLend. The figure represents a 10.3% decrease from the $10.74 billion generated in 2023. EquiLend logo (PRNewsfoto/EquiLend) Global broker-to-broker activity, where broker-dealers lend and borrow securities from each other, totaled an additional $2.57 billion in revenue for 2024, a 9.9% decrease from 2023. Equity lending revenues fell 13% globally, with North America revenue declining 15% and EMEA revenue dropping 24%. In North America , the cause for the revenue decline was a 19% decrease in average fees, while in EMEA, fees and balances decreased 16% and 11%, respectively. Equity lending revenues in APAC were largely flat year-over-year. Global sovereign debt revenue increased by 8% over 2023, with U.S. treasuries making up the lion's share of the gains. Treasuries were up 16% year-over-year, driven by a 14% growth in balances. In corporate debt lending, global revenue declined by 21% as a regression from a record 2023 continued. Fees were the main culprit, with a steep 29% decrease driving the year-over-year decline in revenue. The top five earning securities in 2024 were Sirius XM Holdings ( SIRI US ), Lucid Group (LCID US), Beyond Meat Inc. (BYND US), Tempus AI Inc. ( TEM US ) and Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT US). The five securities in total generated $644 million for lenders over the course of 2024, a significant dip from the $1.11 billion generated by 2023's top five earners.
