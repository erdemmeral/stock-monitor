[{"text": "BrightSpring Health Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:BTSG) Shares Could Be 46% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 3:18 PM 6 min read In This Article: BTSG +0.51% Key Insights BrightSpring Health Services' estimated fair value is US$39.29 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity BrightSpring Health Services is estimated to be 46% undervalued based on current share price of US$21.19 The US$22.91 analyst price target for BTSG is 42% less than our estimate of fair value How far off is BrightSpring Health Services, Inc. ( NASDAQ:BTSG ) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow. We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model . Check out our latest analysis for BrightSpring Health Services What's The Estimated Valuation? We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$189.1m US$223.5m US$249.2m US$271.2m US$290.1m US$306.6m US$321.1m US$334.3m US$346.6m US$358.2m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x2 Analyst x1 Est @ 11.50% Est @ 8.84% Est @ 6.97% Est @ 5.67% Est @ 4.75% Est @ 4.11% Est @ 3.67% Est @ 3.35% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.6% US$177 US$197 US$206 US$210 US$211 US$209 US$205 US$200 US$195 US$189 (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$2.0b Story Continues We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.6%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.6%. Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$358m\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (6.6%\u2013 2.6%) = US$9.2b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = US$9.2b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.6%) 10 = US$4.8b The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$6.8b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$21.2, the company appears quite good value at a 46% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. NasdaqGS:BTSG Discounted Cash Flow January 23rd 2025 The Assumptions We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at BrightSpring Health Services as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.970. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for BrightSpring Health Services Strength No major strengths identified for BTSG. Weakness Interest payments on debt are not well covered. Opportunity Expected to breakeven next year. Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows. Good value based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value. Threat Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow. Next Steps: Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

{"text": "BrightSpring Health Services, Inc. (BTSG) Soars 12.6%: Is Further Upside Left in the Stock? Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 1:36 PM 2 min read In This Article: BTSG +0.51% PINC -1.15% BrightSpring Health Services, Inc. BTSG shares rallied 12.6% in the last trading session to close at $20.89. This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 6.6% gain over the past four weeks. BrightSpring Health Services recorded a strong price rise on investors\u2019 optimism surrounding the company\u2019s announcement of preliminary 2024 financial results. The company expects to report full year 2024 revenue between $11.2 million and $11.3 million, representing a growth of 26.9% to 28.0%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full year 2024 revenue suggests a growth of 26.9%. This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.23 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +483.3%. Revenues are expected to be $2.95 billion, up 24.1% from the year-ago quarter. Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements. For BrightSpring Health Services, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions. So, make sure to keep an eye on BTSG going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Positive Points BrightSpring Health Services Inc ( NASDAQ:BTSG ) entered into a definitive agreement to divest its community living business for approximately $835 million, which is expected to close in 2025. The divestiture will streamline BrightSpring's operations, allowing for enhanced focus on core markets such as home health, hospice, personal care, rehabilitation, and pharmacy services. The transaction is expected to be deleveraging, with plans to use after-tax proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness, accelerating the path towards a three times debt to EBITDA ratio. BrightSpring anticipates a significant increase in growth rate and improved cash flow conversion following the transaction, with 2025 revenue expected to be between $11.5 billion and $12.0 billion. The company reported strong financial performance in Q4 2024, with a 17.5% year-over-year growth in EBITDA, driven by robust performance in both pharmacy and provider segments. Negative Points The divestiture of the community living business may result in a modest impact on BrightSpring's 2024 total company free cash flow generation. The community living business, which is being divested, has been a stable contributor with a Medicaid-funded model, potentially reducing the company's Medicaid payer base from 20% to 12%. There is a risk that the new owner of the community living assets might choose different pharmacy vendors, although current contracts are expected to roll over. The transaction excludes the community living business from 2025 guidance, which may lead to adjustments in financial expectations and reporting. Despite the divestiture, BrightSpring will need to manage the transition and integration of remaining operations to maintain growth momentum and operational efficiency. Story Continues Q & A Highlights Q : Jon, just looking at the 2025 numbers, you're not giving specific numbers around the prior contribution of community living. If I assume that business is probably not growing too much, is 670 a doable number this year? A : Hi, Whit, good morning. I think your assumption there would be solidly in the range for what we otherwise would have guided. - Jon Rousseau, CEO Q : Can you provide details on the overall Medicaid mix of the business after the transaction? A : Community living was a Medicaid-funded business. Our Medicaid as a percent of our total payer base will go down from about 20% to 12% after the transaction. - Jon Rousseau, CEO and Jennifer Phipps, CAO Q : Looking at the numbers you're providing today, it seems like your performance was primarily on the pharmacy side. Anything to call out there? A : Q4 was a very solid quarter with about 17.5% EBITDA growth year-over-year. On the pharmacy side, it was about 22% EBITDA growth year-over-year. - Jon Rousseau, CEO Q : Can you give us a sense of the revenue breakdown for the provider segment going forward? A : Home Health, Hospice, and primary care will be about 50% of the provider revenue, with rehab and personal care making up the rest almost evenly. - Jennifer Phipps, CAO and Jon Rousseau, CEO Q : What will your leverage ratio be by the end of 2025, and what is your expected free cash flow? A : We expect to be very close to three times leverage by the end of 2025. Operating cash flow is expected to be between $275 million and $300 million. - Jon Rousseau, CEO and Jim Mattingly, CFO Q : Can you talk about the selling synergies between community living and other businesses like Home Health and Hospice? A : Community living is primarily Medicaid-funded and has unique referral sources. The remaining businesses have more consistency in patients and delivery models, which allows for a streamlined focus. - Jon Rousseau, CEO Q : For the community living business, is it 100% provider? A : Yes, what we are divesting is 100% provider community living. - Jon Rousseau, CEO Q : Can you clarify the 2025 outlook regarding the community business? A : Yes, the 2025 guidance excludes the community living business, assuming it will be in discontinued operations throughout 2025. - Jennifer Phipps, CAO Q : What are your capital deployment priorities once you reach the target leverage ratio? A : The majority of net proceeds will go to debt reduction, but we will retain some capital for acquisition flexibility. Our M&A pipeline remains strong, and we will continue to be selective. - Jon Rousseau, CEO For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .

Story Continues Jon Rousseau Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's conference call. Since Friday, Brightspring entered into a definitive agreement to divest the community living business to Sevita, a leading provider of home and community based specialty health care. The total consideration in the transaction is approximately $835 million with an expected closing this year in 2025 subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Before I touch on the transaction rationale and impact for Brightspring, I'd like to take a moment to express my gratitude and appreciation to the thousands of employees who are part of the community living business. They work hard every day to deliver attentive compassionate and quality care to clients and patients in need. Individuals who otherwise would be left either without these critical daily services or receive them in institutional settings. With a five decade heritage, we are extremely proud of the continued evolution in this business, particularly over the last eight years. Individuals served in this business can have high health and behavioral acuity. The services can be challenging but also deeply rewarding. And we have continuously invested in our people, technology, homes, quality and compliance, processes and resources and best in class and customized pharmacy services to support all of our clients. As evidenced by years of client and employee testimonials, third party employee awards and statewide accreditations and many other measures, our dedicated teammates and community living have made an enormous impact and they represent people within others first approach to life. Going forward, at this stage of our lifestyle like Brightspring, we are transitioning the community living business to Sevita, a company and team with extensive experience in the I/DD and behavioral industries, who is well suited to continue to provide compassionate care to the community living, client population, leveraging best practices across both organizations. I believe that both organizations will benefit significantly upon the closing of this transaction with increased capabilities and focus in our respective core markets. With this announcement, Brightspring has streamlined its business to become more focused on a concentrated set of core patients and service capabilities, which is beneficial to the company, customers, patients and shareholders for multiple reasons. First, this will result in enhanced operational efficiency across the organization with more time, energy and capital available to support patients in home, health and hospice, personal care, rehabilitation, primary care and the pharmacy businesses. Second, our integrated care synergies and strategic opportunities become more evident with the remaining pharmacy and provider businesses, which all serve the same seniors and specialty populations with similar business and delivery models. And finally, our provider payer mix will become more balanced, as you can see in the transaction, supplemental presentation on our investor relations website. The remaining Brightspring provider services will be comprised of three operating groups for which we will be disclosing revenue following the close of the transaction. They are the home health care segment which will include our home health hospice and primary care services, personal care, and rehabilitation services. Each of these businesses has an attractive growth profile operating in attractive growth markets of significant need with demonstrated and compelling outcomes for all stakeholders. These businesses also have opportunities for both de novo expansion and acquisitions to augment growth and profitability. Following the close of the transaction, our operating structure will allow for a more focused allocation of corporate resources and capital to grow our service capabilities in these areas as well as in our specialty and home community pharmacy business. Ultimately, the divestiture of community living will unlock a more consolidated and attractive provider services business profile with improved revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth. Said another way, the divestiture of community living will be accretive to both the companies and the provider services segments, revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth in the future. As mentioned earlier, the total consideration for the divestiture is approximately $835 million. The transaction is deleveraging and we intend to utilize the after tax proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness and accelerate our path towards three times debt to EBITDA, achieving this level several quarters ahead of our previous plan. The transaction is expected to have a modest impact on our 2024 total company free cash flow generation. Following the close of the transaction, we believe that an increase in company growth rate reduced leverage profile, improved cash flow conversion (technical difficulty) for shareholders (technical difficulty) Turning to our expected 2024 results and guidance for 2025. We are pleased to provide an update to our expected results for 2024, which are anticipated to come in higher than our guidance provided on November 1, following our third quarter results at the time. Our preliminary expected 2024 results including community living are as follows. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $11.2 billion to $11.3 billion with pharmacy solutions revenue expected to be between $8.7 billion to $8.75 billion. And provider services revenue expected to be between $2.5 billion to $2.55 billion. Included within this range are community living revenues which are expected to be approximately $1.194 billion during 2024. Total adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $588 million for the full year 2024. This result would represent approximately 15.8% growth versus full year 2023, when excluding the quality incentive payment received in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to community living business in 2024 is expected to be approximately $128 million. For the full year 2025, we are providing initial guidance which excludes the community living business. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $11.5 billion to $12.0 billion including pharmacy solutions revenue of $10.05 billion to $10.5 billion and provider services revenue of $1.45 billion to $1.5 billion. This would reflect 14.4% to 19.3% growth over full year 2024 at the midpoint, excluding community living in both years. Total adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $540 million to $555 million for the full year 2025 with operating cash flow of over $300 million. This would reflect 17.4% to 20.7% growth over full year 2024 excluding community living in both years. To summarize, 2024 was a successful year for Brightspring on many levels with consistent execution across our businesses, supporting our mission to deliver compassionate and comprehensive health solutions to a large population of complex patients with significant needs while providing significant and clear value to all stakeholders. We are pleased with the broad based strength across pharmacy and provider that continues to underpin Brightspring success. As we enter 2025 and following this announcement, the company is extremely well positioned for continued performance and progress. Before I turn the call over to Q&A, I would like to reiterate my appreciation to the community living employees for their dedication to the clients we serve and to each other. We will now open up the call for questions. Operator? Question and Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions) Whit Mayo, Leerink Partners. Whit Mayo Hey, thanks, good morning. I appreciate you doing this call on such short notice. Jon, just looking at the 2025 numbers. You're not giving specific numbers around the prior contribution of community living. That's in street numbers. But if I assume that business is probably not growing too much, it's not a stretch to see. Maybe 670 is a doable number this year. Am I in the ballpark here or do you think I'm off on my math? Jon Rousseau Hi, Whit, good morning. I think your assumption there would be solidly in the range for what we otherwise would have guided. Whit Mayo Okay, great. And maybe just one other on, I can't remember if you provided the details in the slide deck or not just on the overall Medicaid mix of the business after the transaction. How does that look or how does that change after selling this business? Jon Rousseau So community living was a Medicaid funded business. We've received incredible advocacy in the space and from Medicaid payers at the state level over the last years, in particular, over the last five years and through and after COVID, the value of our services has just never been more evident and it's been very pleasing to see the level of support that we get given the front of the line population and the dramatic ROE on these services for states and the federal government. That all said, our Medicaid as a percent of our total payer base will go down for probably about 20% or 23% substantially. Go ahead, Jen or Jim. Did you have more? Jennifer Phipps Yeah, it will go down. We presented on slide 7. You can see the Q3 mix year-to-date updated, going from 20% Medicaid to 12% Medicaid. Whit Mayo Great. Thank you. Operator AJ Rice, UBS. AJ Rice Thanks. Hi, everybody. Congratulations on the deal. First, I know this isn't the formal Q4 release, but looking at the numbers you're providing today, it looks like your performance was primarily on the pharmacy side. As we ended the year, anything to call out there at a high level ahead of a more formal release down the road? Jon Rousseau Yeah, Q4 was a very solid quarter. Good morning, AJ. We were pleased with it. It was really a record quarter on many levels for the organization. Very good momentum as we head into 2025. Q4 was about 17.5% EBITDA growth year-over-year. On the pharmacy side, it was about 22% EBITDA growth year-over-year and on the provider side, it was still about 16% growth year-over-year, so very strong quarter from really all businesses in both segments. AJ Rice Okay. And I hear that on -- of the $1.5 billion or so provider revenue going forward, it sounds like you're going to start breaking that out between home, health and hospice, personal care, and rehab. Those have sort of been buried within sub segments before. Can you give us a sense of what those look like? Order of magnitude of revenues of each of those buckets? Jon Rousseau Sure. I'll turn it over to Jen for that, but we thought that made a lot of sense. That was the best segmentation on the provider side. And Jen, can you help AJ with just a sense of relative scale there? Jennifer Phipps Yeah, so from -- we will be providing home health and hospice together as we are moving forward. And we are looking from a total perspective, we are looking at about 12.6%. I'm sorry. So we are looking at -- let's see, about 50%, a little less than 50% will be the Home Health, Hospice and primary care segment and then the rest being split almost evenly between rehab and personal care. Jon Rousseau Yeah, AJ, you've got about, you can think about it is the $300 million to $350 million rehab business about the same for personal care and the balance or about [$700 million], $750 million or so in Home Health and Hospice. AJ Rice Okay. That's great. Thanks so much. Operator David Larsen, BTIG. David Larsen Hi, congratulations on the transaction. Can you please remind us of what your leverage ratio will be by the -- by year end 2025 and what your sort of normalized free cash flow will be on an annual basis at the end of '25?Thank you very much. Jon Rousseau Yeah, good morning, David. We're hopeful that we will be very close to three times leverage by the end of 2025 assuming the transaction closes. The transaction in and of itself reduces leverage by about 0.3 turns, a little bit more than that. And then when you combine the expected EBITDA growth next year along with our cash flow generation next year, we should be somewhere in the 3.0 to 3.5 range as we get to the end of the year. I think we should be solidly in the middle of that range. And then based on the outcome of next year, hopefully we can see how close to three times we get. That is on a public EBITDA standpoint too. And then Jim, maybe you want to provide a little bit more color on that? Jim Mattingly Sure, David. It's Jim. As we've always talked about operating cash flow, our guide historically has been run rate of around $275 million for the company as we look to complete this transaction during 2025, pro forma for the transaction and with the planned growth in 2025, we would expect our operating cash flow to be at or higher than that 275 number between 275 and 300, with obvious, working capital and other ongoing initiatives for us to possibly push that number even higher. All in the support of getting to that three times net leverage as quickly as we can. Hopefully, by the end of next year. David Larsen Great. Thank you. And then can you talk about the selling synergies between community living and the other businesses like Home Health, Hospice, Rehab, Primary Care. It's always been my perspective that community living is really selling to sort of a different group of members or patients. So it's kind of-- it's not like you go to a hospital and sell community living along with Hospice along with Home Health along with these other services. If you could just talk about that a bit, please. Thank you. Jon Rousseau Yeah, I mean, as we noted and has been noted elsewhere at this point in time, I mean, I think the primary rationale in the transaction is, is a streamlined organization going forward with a focus on our core markets and it's service settings, really reduce complexity, reduce leverage, all along with increased growth rate. Community living is a business that we have invested in substantially and it's been extremely rewarding to see the progress in this business clinically and from a quality, infrastructure and process standpoint over the last several years and over the last decade at the organization. It's a very stable business with an incredible ROI for states and the government. That said, it is a little bit more unique within our organization. It's primarily a Medicaid, is the main payer and referrals run through case managers at the local market and in state level as well. So there clearly is a consistency of patients and referral sources and delivery models with the remaining organization. Home Health, Hospice, Rehab, Personal Care, and then infusion specialty pharmacy and Home and Community Pharmacy. Those are all very tight businesses from the perspective of who you're serving, the referral, source, setting and the delivery model itself. And that obviously is something that we wanted to try to continue to create as much focus and channel our energy is as productively as possible as we go forward at this point in time. David Larsen All right. One more quick one. For the community living business, is it 100% provider? 0% pharmacy or just what percentage of that business is pharmacy, please? Thank you. Jon Rousseau So what we are divesting is 100% provider community living. David Larsen Okay, great. Thank you. Operator Joanna Gajuk, Bank of America. Joanna Gajuk Hi, good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. So first of a quick one, just to confirm, so your 2025 outlook, right? You said you excluded the community business. So just to confirm, this is the -- you assume for the entire rate starting January 1, even though you did not execute on this transaction yet, correct? Jennifer Phipps Yes, that is correct. So we expect to produce guidance. It will be in our discontinued operations throughout 2025 and we like to report that as an adjustment to EBITDA, reducing our adjusted EBITDA, in 2025. Joanna Gajuk Thank you. That makes sense. And I guess my actual question around the 2025 guidance. So it seems like the pharmacy revenue is better than what we had anticipated. And I guess if we exclude the living, the provider business outlook, sort of as expected at least versus our estimate. So could you say a little bit for us what's assumed for the 2025 pharmacy? Is there anything we should be on the lookout in terms of what's driving that robust growth or is it just consumers of the same or just, any additional color that would be helpful? Thank you. Jon Rousseau Yeah, thank you, Joanna. It would be a continuation of all the things that we've been talking about throughout 2024. And as we enter into January, just seeing continued momentum in the business, really, really from a volume perspective and continuing to execute against a lot of our operational initiatives too. But on the pharmacy side, especially pharmacy business continues to see very, very strong growth rate from referrals coming in. I think in the first couple weeks this year, so far, we've had, 10 or so record referral days. That's just a testament to our quality to do drugs launching and continuing to execute in the field with patients and their families providing just really outstanding services and a really high net promoter score, our home and community pharmacy business, had a nice year last year from a volume perspective as well in the double digit growth on scripts, we see that continuing this year. They landed a large customer in particular and in the back half of last year. And then on the infusion side, as we've talked about, we really see this year, as a reversal and improved performance based on a lot of the operational investments that we've taken in the last 12 months to make. So I would just say continued execution on both the volume and operational side across both pharmacy and provider, really nothing new but just continued focus on our core strategies. Joanna Gajuk And just to clarify on the pharmacy comment and a follow up to the question that was asked before. So you're selling only the community living services, right? But your pharmacy, community pharmacy business is serving the same patient population. So you assume that will continue, right? Is there any risk that somehow they might change that the new owner of these assets might use different pharmacy venders? Jon Rousseau So there is within our home and community pharmacy business, we have our I/DD Behavioral pharmacy as well. There is a minority of that I/DD pharmacy that serves our community like living clients today. That contract will roll over and be assumed by the buyer. It'll go from [rescare] community living that contract will now live with Sevita and we will continue to serve that client population. Joanna Gajuk Great. Thank you so much. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator Stephen Baxter, Wells Fargo. Stephen Baxter Hi, thank you. I was hoping you could give us a sense of what the improvement in the long term revenue and do growth rate is that you're expected as a result of the transaction or I guess, potentially give us the growth of the community and asset for the past couple of years. So we could calculate the drag and I guess is your plan to give us, restated financials for the past couple of years, both for the provider segment and also the total company. Thank you. Jon Rousseau Hey, Steven, good morning. Community living has been a very solid and stable business for us at the organization. As I've said, we have invested heavily in quality and technology in our people, really in the eight years that I've been here and we have an outstanding team with a ton of longevity and consistency in that business, doing just a lot of good in communities for clients in four states. Very stable business that has been a solid contributor to us. You see that Medicaid population that's typically about a 1% to 3% growth rate. There are some sub segments like host home, that can be double digit growth, that's a tremendous model. But we would characterize that as just a very stable business that we have continued to invest in liberally to make sure where we want to be from a process and from an outcome standpoint. It's a business that we love. It's got an incredibly deep mission. But we would characterize that as we always have as more of a stable, steady contributor. I think a way that you can think about it is that the organization excluding community living would have about a -- in our view, as we think about 2025 as we sit here today, about a 6% to 8% increase in growth rate for the organization excluding community living, on an EBITDA standpoint. Jennifer Phipps And then to the second part of your question regarding whether we will provide additional details, we will (technical difficulty) see significant disposal at close. We will obviously be providing the appropriate disclosures at that time. We also expect that in Q1 2025 it will be discontinued operations from an accounting standpoint. So at that time, we will be providing a lot of additional detail, so that you can see specifically the community living business at that time. Stephen Baxter Okay. Yeah, thank you. And I just one quick follow up. Yeah, I'm personally not as familiar with Sevita. And like the amount of overlap you have with them today, I guess you just give us a little bit of insight into the -- kind of the divestiture process and the anti-trust risk and how confident you are around close and any initial conversation, you may have had with States about this transaction? Thank you. Jon Rousseau Yes, Sevita is a very dynamic organization, tremendous leadership team and CEO. They've been around for over 50 years in the behavioral and special care space as well, very long standing heritage sophisticated company. On the second point, I/DD is a massive market and it is extremely fragmented. I think collectively, both our organizations have less than 5% market share and so we do not anticipate any challenges as we work our way through the approval process here in the coming months. Operator Matthew Gillmor, KeyBanc. Matthew Gillmor Hey, thanks for the question. Thanks for hosting the call. I wanted to ask about capital deployment priorities. You mentioned this gets you pretty well along the way to your target of three times by year end. Any thoughts to share in terms of capital deployment priorities, once we get towards that three times level? Jon Rousseau Yeah, good morning, Matt. The preponderance and vast majority of the net proceeds here will go down to pay down debt. We will probably retain some amount of capital for flexibility as we see fit from an acquisition standpoint. One of the real strengths of the organization is our M&A pipeline in capability and in very fragmented spaces where we can bring our our operational sophistication to bear in transactions. Our pipeline remains is as deep as it ever has. We will continue to be very deliberate and very selective in anything we do. I would just note that, for example, in the most recent Haven acquisition that we announced in the back half of last year, that was a business that needed a significant amount of operational items to be addressed and that is occurring and that business is well ahead of plan. That's just another really good example of our ability to drive additional performance in businesses that we choose to partner with. So we continue to be opportunistic as we look at acquisitions. I don't think anything fundamentally changes versus what we've always said before. $10 million to $15 million of highly accretive even a year from acquisitions is pretty straightforward for us, that's been our track record pretty conservatively. And then from there, we can remain opportunistic for situation that we think are very unique and will ultimately provide significant shareholder value. So principally working towards our three times leverage ratio. I think we'll now get there, several quarters before we otherwise would potentially by the end of next year. That's our goal and we will always blend in some very creative M&A to supplement growth as has been our history. Matthew Gillmor Got it. And then one follow up on the 2025 guide, can you just remind us sort of the state of play with the quality incentive payment? Is that something that potentially comes back into play? And are there any assumptions around that for 2025? Jon Rousseau Yeah, that was a unique situation related to DIRS and specialty pharmacy and the pharmacy world which ended in 2023. So that was a four year program from '19 to '23 that ended now 13 months ago. Matthew Gillmor Got it. Thank you. Operator (Operator Instructions) Larry Solow, CJS Securities. Larry Solow Good morning. Congratulations. Thanks for taking the question. Well, most of my questions have been answered. I guess just a question on the $128 million of EBITDA you called out, curious, is there -- it's somewhat of a little bit of the business is kind of a stand-alone, but a bit of a carve out from within a segment. Does that $128 million, exclude any overhead expenses or anything that you might have incurred or the cut, the buyer will have to incur next year as the business is sold? Jon Rousseau Good morning, Larry. Yeah, so within our business is just fundamentally, our approach is that we really leverage enterprise best practices in the organization. I think that's really one of our strengths is being able to bring HR, GR, IT, expertise, sales, and marketing expertise down through each one of our businesses. That's something that we're incredibly focused on to try to outgrow market share within our organisation. I mean, you look back at what we did at the service line level in 2024, I mean, every single one of our service lines except for one grew in the double digits. And that's been a key part of our performance capability set, over time. At the same time, we really balance that with dedicated resources to the businesses. So every one of our businesses has always had dedicated management teams that run their businesses every day and they really benefit from help and support from those specific functions at the corporate and enterprise level. So community living is actually very readily able to be carved out, just given the dedicated employees to that businesses, which is very clear. So in that EBITDA, that would be a net EBITDA number that includes all overhead support for the business. I think as you go forward in the organization after close, we will always continue to look at our resources and there could be opportunities for additional synergies in a streamlined organization, but that would be separate. Larry Solow Got it. And just a question the acquisition, just your appetite for [acquisitions], clearly, your capital deployment, you're focused on reducing the debt. And as you mentioned, this takes you down a little less than a half a turn. Does your goal of three or about three times by year end? I guess that assumes incremental small M&A like you mentioned. But does your appetite potentially clearly gives you a little more room for acquisition? So does this potentially give you a little more opportunity and a little more discretion if something is bigger to come along on an opportunity basis? Thanks. Jon Rousseau Sure. Yeah, the guide that we've provided for 2025 excluding community living, that 17% to 20%, 21% plus growth. That largely excludes any acquisitions next year. So to the extent that we would do any acquisitions, that would be upside potentially to that number. So as I said before, we will be very consistent in our acquisition philosophy and approach as we have historically, there is a baseline amount of EBITDA that we've consistently executed against, which is very accretive where we bring our operational capabilities and synergies to bear from our enterprise. It's a unique capability that we do have. I think our baseline remains our baseline similar to what it's been in the past, certainly we are always open to situations that we think are really unique that we may come across with our relationships. And that we're in a unique position to follow up and execute on. So our baseline remains the same, but I think it is fair to say we maybe have a little bit more flexibility. Second, though to driving towards that target leverage level. Larry Solow Got it. I appreciate the color. Thanks. Operator I show no further questions at this time. I would now like to hand the call back over to Jon Rousseau for closing remarks. Jon Rousseau Thank you, operator. Thank you everybody for joining the call at [08:00 AM] after a holiday. We really appreciate that. Hopefully, this was informative and helpful and we look forward to talking with you again soon. Thank you and have a great day. Operator This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

(\u201cBrightSpring\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NASDAQ: BTSG), a leading provider of home and community-based pharmacy and health services for complex populations, today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to divest its Community Living business, namely ResCare Community Living, to Sevita, a leading provider of home and community-based specialty health care, for $835 million in cash consideration, subject to customary adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in 2025, pursuant to regulatory approvals and typical closing conditions. Following the divestiture, BrightSpring\u2019s Provider Services will be comprised of Home Health and Hospice, Personal Care, Rehabilitation Services, and Primary Care. These service lines have all continued to demonstrate leading quality measures and attractive growth, as well as opportunities to deploy capital to further advance service capabilities and expand geographic coverage. The Company expects to realize additional operational efficiencies across the BrightSpring platform after the divestiture, with a more synergistic portfolio of service offerings overall. The transaction is expected to be accretive to both Company and Provider Services Revenue growth and Adjusted EBITDA growth. For five decades, Community Living has provided critical services for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) and behavioral conditions. \u201cWe are very proud of our mission and heritage, with specialized services that allow individuals to live a much more independent life in their communities, outside of institutions, where they receive ongoing skill-building and daily supports. We have continued to invest in quality, technology, and our people, as evidenced by years of third-party employee awards and statewide accreditations, and I would like to thank our entire Community Living team for their tireless dedication to our clients over the years,\u201d said Jon Rousseau, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of BrightSpring. Story Continues Today\u2019s announcement provides for continuity of important intellectual and developmental disability services while BrightSpring focuses on a concentrated group of customers, patients and stakeholders in the future. The Company\u2019s streamlined service offerings will result in increased strategic focus, operational efficiencies, a refined payer mix, and greater clinical integration and business synergy across the Provider Services and Pharmacy Solutions segments. The divestiture will also augment the Company\u2019s expected Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth rates and maximize exposure to target growth markets that require BrightSpring\u2019s needed and valuable solutions, such as home health, rehab, primary care, hospice, and specialty and home and community pharmacy. The transaction will accelerate the Company\u2019s deleveraging path towards the long-term target of less than 3.0x. Rousseau continued, \u201cIn Sevita, we are pleased to partner with a new owner with extensive experience in the I/DD industry, who is well-suited to continue to provide compassionate care to the community living client population. With enhanced combined processes, technology, and overall capabilities, there are opportunities to share proven and innovative approaches that should advance possibilities for all constituents in this market. I believe both organizations will significantly benefit from amplified focus on core markets.\u201d \u201cSevita and ResCare Community Living share a deep commitment to providing quality community-based health care and improving the lives of those who rely on us every day,\" said Philip Kaufman, CEO of Sevita. \u201cWe look forward to welcoming ResCare Community Living\u2019s talented and experienced team to Sevita. Together, we will be positioned to support more people in need of these impactful services, deploy learnings and best practices from both organizations, and make continued investments in our homes, service delivery and technology \u2013 all with the goal of enhancing the lives of the individuals that we are privileged to serve.\u201d Additional Transaction Details The Community Living business to be divested is expected to generate approximately $1.2 billion in Revenue and approximately $128 million of Adjusted EBITDA in 2024, with approximately $23 million of capital expenditures and capital leases. It includes approximately 14,000 clients receiving services from 13,500 employees (of BrightSpring\u2019s approximately 37,000 FTEs). BrightSpring expects the transaction to result in approximately $715 million of after-tax cash proceeds and intends to primarily utilize the net proceeds for debt paydown, which further strengthens the Company\u2019s balance sheet and reduces interest expense. Guggenheim Securities, LLC and Leerink Partners are serving as BrightSpring\u2019s financial advisors in connection with the transaction, and Polsinelli, Barnes & Thornburg and Simpson Thatcher & Bartlett are serving as BrightSpring\u2019s legal counsel. Barclays and Goldman Sachs are serving as financial advisors to Sevita, and Kirkland and Ellis is serving as legal counsel.

For the full year 2025, BrightSpring is initiating guidance, which excludes the Community Living business and the effects of any future closed acquisitions. All growth rates are calculated based off the midpoint of 2024 guidance, excluding the Community Living business. Net Revenue of $11,500 million to $12,000 million, or 14.4% to 19.3% growth over full year 2024 Pharmacy Segment Revenue of $10,050 million to $10,500 million, or 15.2% to 20.3% growth over full year 2024 Provider Segment Revenue of $1,450 million to $1,500 million, or 8.9% to 12.7% growth over full year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA 2 of $540 million to $555 million, or 17.4% to 20.7% growth over full year 2024 (of approximately $460 million of expected 2024 Company Adjusted EBITDA excluding Community Living) 1 2025 Total Company expected Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth excludes the Community Living business. 2 A reconciliation of the foregoing guidance for the non-GAAP metric of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net loss cannot be provided without unreasonable effort because of the inherent difficulty of accurately forecasting the occurrence and financial impact of the various adjusting items necessary for such reconciliation that have not yet occurred, are out of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to assess the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a material impact on its future GAAP financial results.
