[{"text": "Cryoport Unveils State-of-the-Art Cryogenic Shipping System for Transporting Lifesaving Biologics and Temperature-Sensitive Therapies PR Newswire Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 4:30 PM 4 min read In This Article: CYRX -2.12% New High-Volume Shipping System, Improving Patient Accessibility, Will Be Showcased by Cryoport Systems at Phacilitate's Advanced Therapies Week in Dallas NASHVILLE, Tenn. , Jan. 21, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Cryoport, Inc. (NASDAQ: CYRX) (\"Cryoport\" or \"the Company\"), a global leader in supply chain solutions for the life sciences, today unveiled its Cryoport Express \u00ae Cryogenic HV3 Shipping System (\"HV3\"), the Company's newest product innovation in Cryoport's comprehensive portfolio of global end-to-end temperature-controlled supply chain offerings. Cryoport logo 2024 The HV3 ensures unparalleled protection and accessibility for biologics and other temperature-sensitive materials. Its unique rectilinear design eliminates the need for palletization (securing goods on a pallet for transportation) and provides the ability to transport critical life science materials on narrow-bodied aircraft, ensuring compliance with regional carriers and reducing flight rejections and delays. As a result, the HV3 increases the number of available shipping lanes, which will improve patient access and enable life-saving therapies to reach patients in underserved areas. This newly developed shipping system offers enhanced payload protection and resilience during transport. With additional space for non-temperature sensitive accessories and documentation, the HV3 also improves storage efficiency through the ability to stack and nest the shippers, making it more cost-effective and user-friendly. Full compliance with airline requirements plus an integrated condition and location monitoring system provides full Chain of Compliance \u00ae . Engineered to meet the specific needs of advanced therapies , the HV3 ensures enhanced payload security and superior temperature control, maintaining payload integrity and extended temperature stability at -150\u00b0C or lower. The HV3's structure also enhances mobility with its robust wheels and an integrated front-facing handle, improving accessibility at point-of-care sites. Its design also provides for scalability or higher density storage capabilities at manufacturing and clinical sites. While improving overall safety for clinicians and operators, these improvements enable more efficient handling (and storage) at point-of-care sites, contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMO's), and other storage locations, reducing the need for additional site-based resources. The HV3 is also designed to be used with Cryoport's Safepak \u00ae System. The Safepak \u00ae System is a purpose built solution that utilizes non-metallic, soft materials to minimize the effects of vibration and shock during the transport of cell and gene therapies.

Cryoport logo 2024 Jerrell Shelton , CEO of Cryoport, remarked, \"Our Life Sciences Services business showed 9% growth during the third quarter, with BioStorage/BioServices revenue increasing by 12% compared to the third quarter of last year. The increase in our services revenue was coupled with a substantial improvement in gross margin to 46% for our services business. \"Reflecting on our performance through the third quarter, we are maintaining our full-year revenue forecast of $225 million to $235 million , anticipating continued growth in our services business while acknowledging the ongoing softness in product sales. \"We have been actively executing on our cost reduction and capital realignment strategies and we are currently on course to complete these adjustments by the year's end. These actions are already showing positive results, as evidenced by the improvement in our gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and positive cash flow this quarter, moving us closer towards our objective of sustainable profitability. We believe that these measures will lead us to a return to positive adjusted EBITDA during 2025. \"We expect the macroeconomic and sector-specific challenges that have impacted many companies serving the life sciences industry to continue for the near future, so we plan to further sharpen our focus on profitable growth and maintaining a strong balance sheet. We continue to be optimistic about our long-term business growth trajectory. We believe that we are strategically positioned to leverage the anticipated long-term growth in the Life Sciences and the Cell & Gene Therapy market through our comprehensive and integrated supply chain solutions. \"In October, we launched our IntegriCell\u2122 Cryopreservation Solution with a new state-of-the-art facility on our Houston campus. This offering addresses yet another critical aspect in optimizing the supply chain for the development and commercialization of cell-based therapies through high quality, standardized, cryopreserved starting material,\" Mr. Shelton concluded.

Additional risks and uncertainties include difficulties, delays or Cryoport's inability to successfully complete its planned cost reduction and capital realignment measures, which could reduce the benefits realized from such activities within the time periods currently anticipated. Cryoport's business could be affected by other factors discussed in Cryoport's SEC reports, including in the \"Risk Factors\" section of its most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, as well as in its subsequent filings with the SEC.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures, including revenue at constant currency, revenue growth rate at constant currency and adjusted EBITDA, should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that revenue growth is a key indicator of how Cryoport is progressing from period to period, and we believe that the non-GAAP financial measures, revenue at constant currency and revenue growth rate at constant currency, are useful to investors in analyzing the underlying trends in revenue. Under GAAP, revenue received in local (non-U.S. dollar) currency is translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate for the period presented. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect the results of our operations and the value of our foreign assets and liabilities, which in turn may adversely affect results of operations and cash flows and the comparability of period-to-period results of operations. When we use the term \"constant currency,\" it means that we have translated local currency revenue for the current reporting period into U.S. dollars using the same average foreign currency exchange rates for the conversion of revenue into U.S. dollars that we used to translate local currency revenue for the comparable reporting period of the prior year. Revenue growth rate at constant currency refers to the measure of comparing the current reporting period revenue at constant currency with the reported GAAP revenue for the comparable reporting period of the prior year. However, we also believe that data on constant currency period-over-period changes have limitations, particularly as the currency effects that are eliminated could constitute a significant element of our revenue and could significantly impact our performance. We therefore limit our use of constant currency period-over-period changes to a measure for the impact of currency fluctuations on the translation of local currency revenue into U.S. dollars. We do not evaluate our results and performance without considering both period-over-period changes in non-GAAP constant currency revenue on the one hand and changes in revenue prepared in accordance with GAAP on the other. We caution the readers of this press release to follow a similar approach by considering revenue on constant currency period-over-period changes only in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, changes in revenue prepared in accordance with GAAP. Operating costs and expenses, excluding impairment loss, is defined as operating costs and expenses, excluding impairment losses, if any. Net loss, excluding impairment loss, is defined as net loss, excluding impairment losses, if any. Management believes these measures, when read in conjunction with, and as supplemental to, the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a useful measure of Cryoport's expenses and operating results, a meaningful comparison with historical results, and insight into Cryoport's operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss adjusted for interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition and integration costs, cost reduction initiatives, investment income, unrealized (gain)/loss on investments, foreign currency (gain)/loss, gain on insurance claim, net gain on extinguishment of debt, impairment loss, changes in fair value of contingent consideration and charges or gains resulting from non-recurring events, as applicable. Management believes that adjusted EBITDA provides a useful measure of Cryoport's operating results, a meaningful comparison with historical results and with the results of other companies, and insight into Cryoport's ongoing operating performance. Further, management and the Company's board of directors utilize adjusted EBITDA to gain a better understanding of Cryoport's comparative operating performance from period to period and as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. Adjusted EBITDA is also a significant performance measure used by Cryoport in connection with its incentive compensation programs. Management believes adjusted EBITDA, when read in conjunction with Cryoport's GAAP financials, is useful to investors because it provides a basis for meaningful period-to-period comparisons of Cryoport's ongoing operating results, including results of operations, against investor and analyst financial models, helps identify trends in Cryoport's underlying business and in performing related trend analyses, and it provides a better understanding of how management plans and measures Cryoport's underlying business.

The company reported improvements in gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, and positive cash flow through the quarter, reflecting successful cost reduction and realignment strategies. CryoPort Inc ( NASDAQ:CYRX ) supported a total of 691 global clinical trials as of September 30, with a net increase of 21 clinical trials over the previous year, indicating strong engagement in the clinical trial market. Negative Points The life sciences product business experienced ongoing softness, impacting overall revenue growth. CryoPort Inc ( NASDAQ:CYRX ) faced weaker cryogenic freezer demand in North America and EMEA, contributing to uneven market recovery in its MVE Biological Solutions business. Biopharma market funding took a sequential step down in the third quarter, potentially affecting future trial activity and revenue. The commercial revenue was down slightly sequentially, reflecting uneven performance among commercial customers. The company acknowledged that macro and sector-specific challenges impacting the life sciences tools industry are expected to continue in the near future. Q & A Highlights Q : Can you discuss the timeline for label expansions in the clinical trial service business? A : Jerrell Shelton, CEO: It takes about 6 to 12 months for label expansions to impact operations. Mark Sawicki, CSO, added that early treatment lines are already benefiting the company, with projects from J&J, Legend, Gilead, and Bristol-Myers Squibb contributing. Newer products like CRISPR and Vertex will start contributing revenue in 2025. Story Continues Q : How is the MVE products business performing, particularly in terms of dewars and freezers? A : Jerrell Shelton, CEO: The market recovery for MVE is uneven. Dewar sales met expectations, but cryogenic freezer demand was weaker in North America and EMEA. However, there was an increase in order flow from APAC, excluding China. Robert Stefanovich, CFO, noted that despite lower revenue, the products business maintains a robust gross margin and positive cash flow. Q : Can you provide an update on the BioStorage business and the IntegriCell launch? A : Mark Sawicki, CSO: BioServices revenue increased by 12%, with several projects onboarded in the last six months. IntegriCell opened in October in Houston, with a grand opening in Belgium planned. Initial contracts have been signed, and revenue contribution is expected to grow next year. Q : What are the expectations for market demand and cost actions in 2025? A : Mark Sawicki, CSO: The services business is progressing well, with a strong clinical portfolio. Jerrell Shelton, CEO, mentioned that MVE remains profitable despite depressed demand, and the company is implementing a strategy for China. Robert Stefanovich, CFO, highlighted cost reduction efforts expected to generate over $20 million in annualized savings, with positive EBITDA anticipated in 2025. Q : How is the commercial revenue performing, and what are the expectations for the fourth quarter? A : Mark Sawicki, CSO: Commercial revenue was slightly down sequentially but up 14% year-over-year for the nine-month period. A strong step-up is expected in Q4 as established therapies ramp up and new therapies contribute. Robert Stefanovich, CFO, reiterated the full-year guidance of $225 million to $235 million, with a conservative view on Q4 product expectations but robust services growth.
