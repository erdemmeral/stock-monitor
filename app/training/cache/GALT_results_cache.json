Fri, Jan 3, 2025, 7:59 AM 16 min read Jan. 2\u2014The News-Sentinel is looking back at some of the top local stories of 2024. Today's review covers September through December. The dates listed are when the stories appeared in the News-Sentinel, followed by the headline that accompanied the respective stories and a brief summary. Tuesday, Sept. 3 Sunday Firestorm An arrest has been made in one of two destructive fires on Sunday that started less than 12 hours apart at commercial businesses in Lodi and are being investigated as arson in a joint effort between the Lodi Police and Lodi Fire departments and the San Joaquin County Fire Investigation Unit. Lodi detectives identified Francisco Castillo, a 41-year old Stockton resident, as the suspect in an arson fire at Pacific Coast Producers on Sunday, the City of Lodi announced late Sunday night on Facebook. Castillo was arrested with out incident in the 00 block of South Stockton Street, according to the announcement. He faces charges of arson, loitering, and possession of drugs and has been booked into the San Joaquin County Jail. The motive for the fire is still under investigation. On Sunday afternoon, fire crews responded to a blaze in the pallet yard of Pacific Coast Producers on 700 block of South Stockton Street. The wooden pallets and a mild breeze made for an extremely combustible combination, and required a large amount of resources \u201416 fire engines and nearly 70 firefighters from multiple agencies \u2014 to contain the blaze. Three firefighters were treated for heat-related injuries. An early morning blaze also flared up Sunday at San Joaquin Sulphur Co. on the 700 block of North Sacramento Street, destroying an 8,000-square foot warehouse, according to Lodi Fire Chief Ken Johnson. The two businesses are located about 1 1/2 miles apart. At a press conference across the street from the Pacific Coast Producers pallet yard on Sunday, Johnson, joined by Lodi Police Chief Ricardo Garcia, said the fires are suspicious, noting the close proximity between them and the timing. As of Sunday evening, it was unknown if the two incidents are related, he added. Tuesday, Sept. 10 Visit Lodi names new president and CEO The Visit Lodi Board of Directors announced this week that Wes Rhea will be come Visit Lodi's new president and CEO on Oct. 1. Rhea, currently CEO of Visit Stockton, will succeed Nancy Beckman, who will retire this fall after 23 years. Rhea has spent 19 years as Visit Stockton's CEO, spear heading several initiatives and events, expanding the city's tourism profile, and cultivating strong relationships with business and government partners. The Visit Lodi Board said his experience, passion, and strategic vision made him the perfect choice to build on the organization's achievement. Story Continues Tuesday, Sept. 17 Arrest made in triple homicide near Lodi More than three months after authorities discovered the bodies of three men in a home near Lodi, San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office deputies on Saturday arrested a man for their murders following a lengthy investigation. On June 8 at about 6:33 p.m., deputies were dispatched to the 1500 block of East Mettler Road, south of Lodi, to conduct a welfare check. Concerned family members told deputies they had not been able to reach the residents for over a week. Upon arrival, deputies found three adult residents dead from gun shot wounds, reports state. An investigation immediately led detectives to believe that the murder was a targeted incident, and they obtained evidence leading them to a suspect. The incident was not reported at the time in an effort to not jeopardize the investigation, the Sheriff's Office said. Detectives arrested 25-year old Steven Guerrero Jr. on Sept. 14 and booked him into San Joaquin County Jail. He is being held without bail on suspicion of murder, burglary, and a weapons charge, and he is scheduled to appear in San Joaquin County Superior Court today at 1:30 p.m. The San Joaquin County Coroner and Medical Examiner identified the victims as 60-year-old Joe Pena, 69-year-old Kim Huynh and 45-year-old Alfred Nguyen, all of Lodi. Thursday, Sept. 19 False alarm, frantic lockdown at Lodi High Hundreds of parents flocked to Lodi High School's front gate on Pacific Avenue Wednesday morning after receiving texts from their students that the campus had been locked down. The Lodi Police Department responded to an alarm at the high school at about 10:42 a.m., and spent an hour investigating the campus. Parents waiting outside received frantic texts claiming officers were looking for four suspects, and that at least two had been detained. Rumors spread that at least one of the alleged suspects had been hiding in a restroom or closet. But at about 11:40 a.m., officers emerged from inside the locked gate, stating the incident was a false alarm. \"It looks like an absolute accident,\" school resource officer Gerald Bahr told parents. \"It looks like an alarm button was pushed, we don't know which one. But we searched the entire campus and there was no danger.\" The district issued a statement on social media at 11:46 a.m. stating a substitute secretary had pushed an alarm button by accident. The lockdown comes two days after police arrested a Lodi teenager for making online threats against a local school. Schools and police departments across the nation have been on high alert for nearly a week as threats of violence toward schools make their rounds on social media. Friday, Sept. 27 Deceased infant found in Lodi parking lot Lodi detectives are investigating the death of an infant found in the area of Tokay and Sacramento streets on Thursday morning, according to the Lodi Police Department. David Franco, an employee at Commissary Azteca on Sacramento Street, said he discovered the infant's body while eating lunch. Franco said he typically eats lunch in the parking lot on the southeast corner of Sacramento and Tokay streets, and was sitting under a tree for shade. He said he just happened to look behind him at about 11 a.m., and noticed something laying on the ground between two cars parked against a nearby wall. Franco brought coworkers back to the parking lot to con firm his suspicions, and then they called police. Wednesday, Oct. 9 Citizens weigh in on homelessness at Lodi town hall Several residents chastised the Lodi City Council and city staff this week for the way in which the homelessness crisis has been handled over the last year. The city hosted a town hall at Hutchins Street Square Monday evening to discuss what steps to take in removing the unsheltered and unhoused from streets in the wake of a recent Supreme Court decision that ruled cities enforcing anti-camping bans are not violating the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. The nearly five-hour meeting featured presentations from the city, San Joaquin County and the State of California highlighting what agencies have done to combat homelessness. Thursday, Oct. 17 More might in the mosquito fight The San Joaquin County Mosquito Control and Vector District broke ground on a new state-of-the-art facility Tuesday that will improve its research and surveillance efforts. Although construction on the 5,659-square foot structure at 7759 S. Airport Way in Stockton began last month, the district's board of trustees wanted to memorialize the milestone with a formal ceremony. The new laboratory will replace the district's existing 1,632-square foot building, allowing for more mosquito samples to be analyzed and more staff to be able to research. The new structure, he said, will allow the district to have advanced equipment and resources that will match the high level of work staff puts in every day. Wednesday, Oct. 30 Eastside access Lodi's underprivileged residents no longer have to travel across town or to Stockton for health care access. Community Medical Centers officially opened its \"Lodi East\" medical center on Tuesday, a nearly 27,000-square-foot facility providing primary health care, dental services, behavioral health resources, recovery and pharmacy services in one location. It was a project years in the making, CEO Christine Noguera said, as plans were first drafted before the COVID-19 pandemic. The Stockton-based organization broke ground on the 1150 S. Cherokee Lane site last year, making the location the fourth in Lodi. The Lodi East facility will serve some 20,000 patients annually, Noguera said, offering 24 exam rooms, seven dental operatories and four counseling rooms for its broad range of services. Friday, Nov. 1 A tragic mystery A Lodi family is looking for answers after their teenage son was shot and killed near Acampo last week. Jamaria Rodgers said San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office deputies initially told her family that her nephew Kenton Bluitt-Ealy was involved in an automobile accident around midnight on the evening of Oct. 25 near Jack Tone and Collier roads. Bluitt was pronounced dead at the scene, and the family was told he sustained injuries as a result of the collision. However, Rodgers said detectives disclosed earlier this week that Bluitt had actually been shot, and that was determined to be his cause of death. An investigation is ongoing. Friday, Nov. 8 Will pay bump entice more council candidates? The Lodi City Council gave itself a pay increase for the first time in more than 16 years Wednesday night, citing compliance with a state law that took effect Jan. 1. Last year, the California Legislature enacted Senate Bill 329, which increased compensation for council members across the state, according to population. Under the bill, staff said, council members could be paid $950 a month in cities with populations of 35,000 or fewer residents, while council members in cities with populations of more than 250,000 would be paid $3,200 a month. Council members in cities with populations between 50,000 and 75,000 would be compensated $1,600, staff said. Lodi's population, as of the last U.S. Census in 2020, was 66,348. Council members are currently compensated $860 a month, along with benefits, and have not received a stipend increase since 2008. Wednesday, Nov. 13 'She's missed every day' ACAMPO \u2014 Last year, the Oak View Elementary School community lost one of its longest-serving members. Terry Delaney, who passed away on Nov. 10, 2023, spent 25 years as a teacher's aide, bus driver and librarian at the school. On Tuesday, faculty and staff unveiled a mural dedicated in Delaney's memory, located on the front exterior wall of the campus library. \"It's the perfect embodiment of everything she stands for,\" Principal and Superintendent Beverly Boone said. \"I think it's just going to be a beautiful addition to the front of the library for the kids.\" The mural, commissioned by Lodi artist Tony Segale, features renderings of the books \"Oh, the Places You'll Go!\" by Dr. Seuss and \"Where the Wild Things Are\" by Maurice Sendak, as well as a yellow rose, all set on a \"Seussical\" back ground. Sarah Delaney said her mother-in-law loved being a librarian, and loved Oak View, adding she always shared stories of the library with her family. Delaney said her moth er-in-law kept countless numbers of notes, letters, drawings and knick-knacks from students during her 25 years at the school. She hoped the mural would re mind students of the love and laughter they shared with the librarian over the years. Wednesday, Nov. 20 Temporary basis Three years after the idea to build a place to help the homeless get back on their feet, the City of Lodi is ready to break ground. During a special meeting Tuesday afternoon, the the Lodi City Council voted 4-0 to award a $9.86 million contract with Bobo Construction, Inc. of Elk Grove to build the permanent access center at 712 N. Sacramento St. A temporary center has been operating at the site since July of 2022. Bobo Construction was one of seven to bid on the long-awaited project, beating out DL Falk Construction, Inc. of Hayward, which bid a $9.89 million. The access center will be 23,000 square feet in size, housing 106 individuals a day, with the ability to add as many 102 beds as needed to meet the original plan of 208 beds, staff said. The project also includes a commercial kitchen and space for as many as four classrooms that will benefit clients while they transition back into society. The estimated cost for the project was $13 million, and the city has $10.6 million in capital funding available, staff said. Wednesday, Nov. 27 City of Lodi parts ways with deputy city manager In a surprising move, the City of Lodi is looking for a new deputy city manager. Andrew Keys, who held the position for seven years, served his final day on the job Tuesday, according to City Manager Scott Carney. \"I announced to staff that today is his last day,\" Carney said. \"I appreciate Mr. Keys' professionalism during the transition. Work to fill the position will begin immediately.\" Keys worked for the City of Elk Grove for a decade before arriving in Lodi in 2017. He began as Elk Grove's finance analyst and worked his way up to revenue manager, accounting manager and budget manager before serving as interim city manager for one year. He served as Lodi's interim city manager for eight months following Steve Schwabauer's retirement in October of 2023, and applied for the permanent position. Carney was hired as Schwabauer's replacement and began in June. Thursday, Dec. 5 Luck of the straw draw The race for one of two seats on the Galt City Council came down to the wire Tuesday night as two candidates participated in an unusual way to determine victory. Former Galt Herald publisher Bonnie Rodriguez and former Galt Joint Union High School District trustee Mathew Pratton both received 3,882 votes by the time the Sacramento County Registrar of Voters certified ballots this week. Rather than ask for taxpayers to fund a special election, the council asked the pair to draw straws during its Tuesday night meeting. A city resolution calls for a straw drawing competition, and Galt city clerk Tina Hubert said that a special election could cost $165,000. Pratton ultimately drew the longer straw, and he and Tim Reed will replace Kevin Papineau and Jay Vandenburg on the council, both of whom decided not to seek re-election this year. It was the first time in the city's history that an election was decided with a tie-breaker that did not involve a special election. Saturday, Dec. 7 Lodi salon owner shot dead in Woodbridge A man is in custody on murder charges after a deadly shooting in Woodbridge early Friday morning. San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Heather Brent said deputies responded to a shooting in the 900 block of Academy Street just after mid night and found a woman with a fatal gunshot wound. The suspect was found immediately on scene and arrested on suspicion of murder, she said. Brent said investigators are not disclosing the suspect's name at this time out of respect to the families involved. Hilda Loza, a hairdresser at Salon Envy, 200 N. School St., said the victim was her employer Nicole Winans. Loza said she had known Winans for five years, and that she had been going through a divorce. According to San Joaquin County Jail inmate record posted on social media Friday morning, Shane Winans was booked on murder and willful cruelty to a child with possible injury or death charges at 8:46 a.m. Friday. Shane Winans, the owner of Anchors Away Tattoo and Body Piercing Parlor, located at 8 N. School St., is being held with out bail. Tuesday, Dec. 10 Shake, rattle and roll: Temblor ripples through Lodi Lodi was a little shaken up Monday afternoon after residents reported feeling an earthquake centered in western Nevada. The U.S. Geological Survey reported a 5.5-magnitude temblor centered 14 miles from Yerington struck at 3:08 p.m., some 138 miles from Lodi. Lodians commenting on the News Sentinel's Facebook page shared what they experienced as the quake hit. \"Wow, that was scary,\" said Dianna Garcia, adding \"that was my first time ever feeling an earthquake.\" \"I was feeding my baby and the bed was shaking so we ran to the doorway,\" Amber Neyrick said. \"Sitting on my bed and felt it strongly and my hanging lantern was swaying,\" Kelly Marzolf Hampel said. \"That's my telltale earthquake sign.\" \"It shook me and my husband as we sat at the kitchen table,\" Sandra Acox Jackson said. Monday's temblor was four days after a 7.0 quake rattled much of Northern California. That quake, centered 45 miles south west of Eureka in the Pacific Ocean, triggered a 45-minute tsunami warning Thursday morning. Saturday, Dec. 14 Health officials: Two human cases of avian flu in SJ County STOCKTON \u2014 Two human cases of the H5N1 virus, also known as avian flu, have been confirmed in San Joaquin County, according to local public health officials and the Centers for Disease Control. Officials said the cases occurred in farm workers with known exposure to infected animals, and both have had mild symptoms and are recovering. There have been 34 confirmed human cases of avian flu in California this year. \"We have an abundance of dairy farms in our county and want to en sure that these farm workers can do their important work as safely as possible by using (personal protection equipment),\" said Dr. Maggie Park, San Joaquin County's public health officer. \"We are also encouraging the public to avoid consuming raw milk or raw eggs and not to handle any dead birds. Our agency is working closely with numerous county and state partners to continue monitoring the status of H5N1 cases.\" Health officials are actively monitoring ex posed farm workers for symptoms, providing flu vaccinations, and distributing PPE and educational resources. Friday, Dec. 10 'Hire them young' When he was first elected to the Lodi City Council two years ago, Cameron Bregman made history as the youngest resident to serve at the age of 22. On Wednesday night, he made history once again, becoming the youngest Lodian to serve as mayor. The city council unanimously voted for Bregman to lead the city in 2025, and chose Ramon Yepez to serve as vice mayor, also with a unanimous vote. \"While I would never say I would do a better job than Lisa (Craig-Hensley) \u2014 because she's sitting right next to me and within hit ting distance \u2014 I would say I'd do a different job,\" Bregman said Wednesday night. \"The goals and strategic vision of this city will move forward. The path already exists, and we need to continue to move forward, not back.\" As for his age, Bregman said he had always been told to \"hire them young while they know it all, lest that knowledge be forgotten later.\" View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard Recommended Stories", "symbol": "GALT", "date": "2025-01-03T04:59:00+00:00", "sentiment": {"score": -0.5506593734025955,

Khan agreed to three years in prison in relation to election fraud charges brought against him last year. \"The eight years were suspended to give (Khan) an opportunity to change his ways, abide by the lawful conditions and give him an opportunity to become a law-abiding citizen,\" San Joaquin County District Attorney Ron Freitas said. \"We always felt the evidence was strong and because of the strength of the evidence, he was really backed into a corner and had no option.\" Of the 77 counts against Khan, 41 were related to illegal gambling, money laundering, tax evasion and grand theft, and 22 were related to false claims filed with the California Employment Development Department regarding COVID-19 reimbursements. The remaining 14 counts were related to election fraud. \"Today is a reminder that the law will be applied fairly to everyone in San Joaquin County, no matter what your title,\" Freitas said. \"And we will defend the very basis of our democratic institutions, our representative republic and your right to vote each and every time someone tries to endanger them.\" Take a Bow Lodi's Kathryn Siddle and Elise Forbes have been selected by the San Joaquin County Commission on the Status of Women to receive 2024 Susan B.

Jan. 12 Popular Lodi eatery Pietro's gets initial OK to build new restaurant at Reynolds Ranch One of the oldest restaurants in Lodi took its first step toward moving into new digs. The Lodi Site Plan and Architectural Review Committee approved plans for a new 8,990-square-foot restaurant at 282 Rocky Lane during its Wednesday night meeting.

He said if you can make it three years, let's go for that. Let's try to make it three years.\" On Tuesday, the Mud Mill, located at 115 S. School St., celebrated 20 years of offering do-it-yourself pottery painting.

The first half was weak to me and the crowd. But the coach told them what-to and made them stand in a corner, I guess.\" Feb. 16 'Yo Soy Lodi' mural lifts up the city's Latino community As Lodi residents and visitors venture through the city, they can view several murals depicting the area's history, from the \"Packing Shed\" mural at the corner of Walnut and School streets, to the Japantown mural on the Lodi Buddhist Church Annex Building, to the \"Cycles of Suffrage\" on the side of the downtown parking garage. Now, a mural celebrating Lodi's cultural diversity and difference makers in the community is the latest addition to the city's collection of inspiring wall art. The \"Yo Soy Lodi\" mural, the brainchild of Sandra Vargas and Natalie Bowman \u2014 founder of Partners for International Cooperation \u2014 was unveiled last month at 502 E.

Feb. 22 Galt Council approves major renovations and expansion at skate park Citing the need for permanent equipment and the fact the original facility was only meant to be temporary, the Galt City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved expanding the Chabolla Skate Park. With the vote, Galt's Parks and Recreation Department staff will issue a request for proposals for schematic design work, design documents and construction in the coming weeks. Built in 2003, the skate park will see a variety of improvements made, including new concrete, new lighting, and a new fence and gates. Councilman Shawn Farmer said it had been a long time coming that the city do something to improve the park, and likened it to the spare donut wheel in vehicles that are only to be used for short periods of time. Feb. 24 Isleton's Asian Heritage Park to present stories of both success and hardship For many years, it has been a vacant lot, home to weeds and a lone Persimmon tree. But this year, the nondescript space in downtown Isleton is being transformed. It's becoming the Asian American Heritage Park, a place of remembrance and reflection. The park will tell the stories of Chinese and Japanese immigrants who built Isleton \u2014 and much of the Delta.

Feb. 29 Lodi science museum to host celebration on Sunday What began as an inspiration after a trip to the Exploratorium in San Francisco has become a Lodi institution. The World of Wonders Science Museum is celebrating its 15th birth day on Sunday, March 3, showcasing all of its programs and exhibits to the Lodi community. The idea to open a science museum was hatched in 2004 when Dan Ingrum, owner of Downtown Lodi's Danz Jewelers, took his family to the Exploratorium in San Francisco. Ingrum brought the idea to fellow members of the Lodi Rotary Club, who embraced it and immediately formed a steering committee to get the museum up and running. The museum received its non-profit status in 2006, and the committee worked with City of Lodi to open the WOW at 2 N. Sacramento St. three years later. March 7 Lodi's Liberty High named one of state's top continuation schools Liberty High School was one of nearly three dozen campuses recognized by the state for its efforts to meet the academic, social, physical and emotional needs of its students. State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond announced Tuesday that Liberty was named a Model Continuation High School for 2024. The school was one of 31 to be recognized across the state, and one of two in San Joaquin County. Lodi Unified School District said Liberty's mission is to serve as a safe haven where students experience academic success and personal growth as they earn their diplomas and plan for their future. March 9 Lodi had large jump in fentanyl-related cases last year Interim Lodi City Manager Andrew Keys said fentanyl-related cases in creased by 48.6% in Lodi last year. In his weekly update, Keys said there were 214 documented cases involving fentanyl, with 172 leading to arrests in 2023. The previous year, there were 144 cases and 114 arrests, he said. Lodi Police Department officers had to deploy Narcan 30 times to keep individuals from overdosing, he said, while Lodi Fire Department personnel used Narcan 36 times. March 13 In Lodi and across the state, growers scrap vineyards A once-in-a-generation downturn in the wine market is reshaping California's grape-growing regions as farmers tear out vines to rebalance supply with declining demand. Throughout this winter, bulldozers plowed through Lodi's wine country, leveling vineyards and piling vines in mangled heaps on either side of Highway 99 in San Joaquin County. Thousands of acres in the region have been removed or are slated for removal, according to an ongoing survey of its members by the Lodi District Grape Growers Association. \"There are significantly more pullouts than happen in a normal year,\" said Amy Blagg, the association's executive director. Winegrape growers typically sign pre-plant contracts with wineries to plant and farm a vineyard block for 10 years or longer, and then negotiate new short er-term contracts for that block or sell uncommitted grapes on the spot market. Old or out-of-contract vineyards are re moved for various reasons or when no longer profitable. One Lodi-area grower said he was taking out more acres this winter than ever before. Another said the need to remove vines was greater and more urgent now than at any point in his or his parents' lifetime. After decades of growth, U.S. wine sales slowed around 2013 before declining steadily for the past three years. Statewide, industry leaders have called for growers to remove some 50,000 acres \u2014 around 9% of California's wine grape-bearing acreage \u2014 to achieve market balance. March 3 Galt fast food worker provides life-saving service A local McDonald's crew member is being hailed a hero after her actions helped save the life of a customer undergoing cardiac arrest last month. It was a typical morning on Feb. 28 for Hillary Crownover, who at 5 a.m., had just walked through the doors of the McDonald's on Pine Street in Galt. She and her coworkers went in the back of the restaurant to clock in, and Patrick \"Bo\" Sutton had entered the lobby for his usual cup of coffee. After checking in, Crownover came back out to the front of the restaurant with Sutton's coffee, and found he had fallen on the floor. \"I ran over and I heard him making some gurgling noises, so I ran back and told everybody to call 911,\" Crownover said. \"Then I ran back and started CPR. I saw his eyes were pinpoint and he wasn't breathing, so I started CPR immediately and they called 911, and when the dispatcher got on she said don't stop.\" Crownover said she pumped Sutton's chest with her hands for about 15 minutes before her arms began to give out. A coworker took over, and minutes later, firefighter paramedics from Cosumnes Fire Department Station 45 were on scene. On Friday, the department visited the restaurant and honored Crownover for her efforts with a certificate of appreciation. Fire Chief Felipe Rodriguez said it was a great day to celebrate a hero in Galt. March 30 Lodi's Russ Lake honored for his decade of volunteering with the Junior Giants program A Lodi man was honored by the San Francisco Giants this week for his dedication to the city's youth, and his name will forever be enshrined with some of baseball's biggest names. Russ Lake was inducted into the organization's Junior Giants Hall of Fame on Tuesday at the annual Play Ball Luncheon held at Oracle Park in San Francisco. \"It's pretty amazing,\" Lake said of the honor. \"At first I was speechless, and I'm usually not speechless. But it started to sink in, and then I did some research on the Hall of Fame and saw some pretty big heavy hitters in there. I felt pretty special.\" The Junior Giants Hall of Fame honors coaches and lead organizers who have helped to build the program over the last 17 years. April 4 Giannoni, after 'wild' campaign, will be first woman to represent Area 5 If you had asked Jordan Giannoni a decade ago if she could see herself in an elected position, she would have answered \"no.\" The Lodi resident won the Area 5 seat on the San Joaquin County Board of Education in the March 5 presidential primary election in her first attempt at running for political office. She will replace Greg Clark on July 1, and in doing so, becomes the first woman to serve Area 5 on the board. In addition, it's the first time in 18 years that an incumbent faced a challenger for the seat. \"It's a little surreal,\" Giannoni said. \"Because I'm not a career politician. I've never run in a race before, and I felt like if I just get elected, doing the job would be okay. But the whole process of the campaign is probably the wildest thing I've ever done.\" April 13 A new era emerges for Lodi's historic Zupo Field More than three years after a fire destroyed several structures at Zupo Field, Lodi's historic baseball stadium has reopened to the community. City of Lodi staff held a ribbon cutting at the Washington Street baseball diamond Friday afternoon, unveiling a new grandstand and press box, as well as LED security lighting, backstop and under ground infrastructure, among other improvements. \"It's turned out to be a beautiful facility that's going to be enjoyed for generations to come, like many generations in the past in Lodi have enjoyed this field,\" interim city manager Andrew Keys said. Just before 5 p.m. on Sept. 22, 2019, Lodi Fire Department crews responded to a fire at the 100-year-old stadium and found the main grandstand, press box and office engulfed in flames. Replacing everything that was lost in the fire cost an estimated $4.6 million, covered mostly through insurance. Former Assemblyman Jim Cooper was also able to get the State Legislature to award the city $750,000 toward repairs and reconstruction in 2020. April 16 Woman's Club of Lodi to host grand re-opening of historic clubhouse The Woman's Club of Lodi will hold a grand re-opening for its clubhouse on Saturday, a little more than a year after the roof collapsed following a flurry of torrential storms. Saturday's event, which is 1-4 p.m. at 325 W. Pine St., will include a walking tour of the 101-year-old building, refreshments, and a presentation from Lodi Mayor Lisa Craig. \"This is just a reopening, a kind of we're back in business kind of thing,\" Woman's Club past president Daphne Felde said. \"People have been curious about what's going on in here, and plenty of people have never been in the building. So we thought let's just go ahead and have an open house they can wander through.\" April 20 Lodi's Yadina Pena honored for efforts to ensure student safety Three years ago, Yadina Pena decided she had enough of vehicles speeding through Heritage District streets, endangering the life of her children and their friends. The Lodi Unified School District had one crossing guard near the school, stationed at Garfield and Eden streets. When Pena asked the district to place a guard at the intersection of East Tokay and South Garfield streets, she was told there was not enough funding. So, she made her own hand-held \"stop\" sign, donned a dinosaur costume, and took on the role of a crossing guard to get motorists to pay attention and slow down. For her efforts to ensure the safety of Heritage students, Pena was honored by the Lodi Police Department at its annual awards ceremony Thursday afternoon with the Citizen Service Award. April 23 Visit Lodi set to celebrate 25 years of growing with and promoting the city A quarter century ago, members of the Lodi Woodbridge Winegrape Commission approached city leaders with a proposal aimed at revolutionizing tourism in the area. The proposal was to create a department that would be responsible for attracting visitors and conferences to Lodi, promoting the latter at established sites such as the Grape Festival grounds, Hutchins Street Square or Micke Grove Regional Park. City of Lodi leaders and staff liked the proposal, but said they did not want to implement another department at city hall. As a result, the city agreed to fund the new department, but gave the winegrape commission the authority to oversee it. That department was implemented in 1998, christened the Lodi Conference & Visitors Bureau with funding from the city and in kind support from the commission and others in the community. Now known as Visit Lodi, the organization will be celebrating 25 years on May 7 with its \"Spirit of Tourism\" event at Hutchins Street Square. \"It's pretty exciting,\" Visit Lodi president and CEO Nancy Beckman said. \"It's just been an amazing time to watch how Lodi has grown as a tourist destination over the years.\" April 26 Richard A. Pittman VA Clinic unveiled in French Camp Julie Pittman said this week's ribbon cutting for the region's new Veterans Administration clinic was a \"full circle moment\" for her family. Her father, Stockton native and Congressional Medal of Honor recipient Richard A. Pittman was born at San Joaquin General Hospital, and now the new clinic located directly north on South Manthey Road will bear his name. Veterans in attendance at Thursday's ceremony said that they all earned and were entitled to services the new clinic provides. The VA Northern California Health Care System hosted a ribbon cutting for the new Richard A. Pittman VA Clinic at 6505 S. Manthey Road in French Camp on Thursday. The 158,000 square-foot facility will provide some 200,000 veterans in the Central Valley a plethora of services. April 27 Former Stockton official to be Lodi's city manager The Lodi City Council will be officially hiring its new city manager during next week's May 1 meeting. Former Stockton deputy city manager Scott Carney has been tapped to take over for Steve Schwabauer, who left the post last September. Carney currently serves as the deputy director of administration for the California Department of Health Care Services, and has a wealth of history working for the state.

Rodriguez still lands on Galt Council Wes Bowers, Lodi News-Sentinel, Calif. Thu, Dec 19, 2024, 11:51 PM 3 min read Dec. 19\u2014Two weeks after receiving the short straw in a historic tie-breaking vote, Bonnie Rodriguez found her way to the Galt City Council dais. Rather than have taxpayers foot the bill for another election, the council on Tuesday voted 4-0 to appoint Rodriguez to its vacant seat. Rodriguez replaces Rich Lozano, who resigned Dec. 4 upon his election to the Cosumnes Community Services District Board of Directors. Rodriguez said on Wednesday that she was flattered all four councilmen wanted her to join them. \"I'm glad we're getting everything settled and we're able to move on so we can take care of business,\" she said. \"I'm very happy to be able to sit on the council and be able to help make important decisions for the city.\" When polls closed on Nov. 5 in the general election, Rodriguez had collected 2,050 votes and was third in the race for the two seats up for grabs on the council. Mathew Pratton garnered 2,188 votes, and Rodriguez told the News-Sentinel earlier this month that she had come to terms with losing the election. However, by Nov. 16, about 100 votes separated the two candidates, with Pratton garnering 2,764 votes and Rodriguez earning 2,667. Rodriguez took a slight lead in the race by Thanksgiving, collecting 3,855 votes to his 3,853, and on Dec. 4, they were in a dead heat with 3,882 votes. City staff said a special election would cost taxpayers $165,000, so Rodriguez and Pratton drew straws to determine who would take the second empty seat on the council. Tim Reed secured his seat with 5,870 votes. Pratton drew the longer straw, and he and Reed replaced Kevin Papineau and Jay Vandenburg, both of whom decided not to seek re-election this year. The council had 60 days to decide how to fill Lozano's seat, and could have held a special election or accepted applications for an appointment at a future meeting. Its third option was to appoint the runner-up and fill the seat during Tuesday's meeting. Councilman Shawn Farmer said he did not favor holding a special election, noting that option was not chosen on Dec. 3 to break the tie between Rodriguez and Pratton. Farmer said it was worth noting that Rodriguez was the first candidate to secure more votes than an opponent and not win a seat on the council. \"This has nothing to do with Ms. Rodriguez personally, but I think regardless of who's in that seat, the voters have spoken,\" he said. \"If 3,000 people wanted Ms. Rodriguez to be on the council, we should honor that.\" Reed echoed Farmer's sentiments, and said if the council were to accept applications, four people would be deciding who the next member would be, and not the voters. Story Continues \"If we appoint the third-place finisher, we have more than 3,000 people who want her to be on this city council,\" he said. \"And I think we're up here to do what's best for the residents of the city, and that is who has made this choice.\" Along with appointing Rodriguez to the dais, the council unanimously voted to elect Farmer as mayor for 2025. Mayor Paul Sandhu was unanimously chosen to serve as vice mayor. Sandhu also thanked Vandenburg and Papineau for their service on the council the last four years. \"The job takes a great deal of commitment, dedication and time to represent the people of Galt,\" he said. \"I appreciate your insightful, analytical approach to council deliberation, and steadfast dedication to ensuring the community's voice is always heard in such a manner.\" View Comments Terms

(GALT) is Poised for a Turnaround After Losing -31.83% in 4 Weeks Zacks Equity Research Mon, Dec 9, 2024, 5:35 PM 2 min read In This Article: GALT -1.60% Galectin Therapeutics Inc. (GALT) has been on a downward spiral lately with significant selling pressure. After declining 31.8% over the past four weeks, the stock looks well positioned for a trend reversal as it is now in oversold territory and there is strong agreement among Wall Street analysts that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier. How to Determine if a Stock is Oversold We use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30. Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal. So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound. However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.

Fri, Dec 20, 2024, 4:00 PM 8 min read In This Article: GALT -1.60% Galectin Therapeutics Inc. In the pre-specified per-protocol population, belapectin showed a statistically significant reduction (p-value < 0.05) in development of esophageal varices in 2mg/kg cohort compared to placebo While there was a favorable trend for incidence of varices in the primary end point intent-to-treat population, belapectin did not achieve statistical significance Belapectin was overall well tolerated with no safety signals; incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events were comparable across the three cohorts Additional data to be presented in early 2025 NORCROSS, Ga., Dec. 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Galectin Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: GALT), the leading developer of therapeutics that target galectin proteins, today announced results from its global clinical trial NAVIGATE evaluating belapectin in patients with Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH) cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The NAVIGATE trial ( NCT04365868 ) is a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in over 130 sites in 5 continents, across 15 countries including the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Australia, U.K, France, Germany, Korea and Israel. 355 patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive intra-venously either belapectin 2mg/kg of lean body mass (LBM) (n=119), belapectin 4 mg/kg/LBM (n=118) or placebo (n=118) every other week for 18 months. The primary endpoint was defined as the prevention of varices, assessed as a composite clinical outcome that included subjects with any varices, those with intercurrent events, or those without an endoscopy or intercurrent events at 18 months. Intercurrent events were defined as any liver-related complication, treatment discontinuation due to adverse events, use of non-selective beta-blockers (NSBB) or GLP-1 agonists for more than 12 months or undergoing a TIPS procedure. The most common intercurrent event was prolonged use of NSBB or GLP-1 agonists. In the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (N=355), while the incidence of varices was 43.2% reduced in the belapectin 2 mg/kg dose group vs placebo, the composite endpoint did not reach statistical significance. The per-protocol population (PPP) was pre-defined as subjects who completed 18 months of therapy with upper endoscopy performed at both baseline and 18 months. In the PPP (n=290), the incidence of varices was reduced by 48.9% (compared to the targeted 52.5% reduction) in the belapectin 2 mg/kg dose group (p-value < 0.05). These clinical outcomes (lower incidence of varices) were supported by non-invasive measures, where liver stiffness assessed by Fibroscan\u00ae indicated a 50% lower number of subjects with worsening stiffness (defined as an increase of \u22655 kPa or \u226525%; thresholds associated with worse clinical outcomes). Story Continues As in prior trials, the safety profile of belapectin remains highly encouraging with incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events comparable across the three cohorts. Rates of discontinuation, adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs) were comparable to placebo, with no drug-related SAEs reported in the NAVIGATE trial. Dr. Khurram Jamil, Chief Medical Officer at Galectin Therapeutics, stated, \u201cWhile we had hoped that the NAVIGATE trial would meet its composite primary endpoint, we are highly encouraged by trends we have seen at only 18 months of treatment in the ITT population and by the statistically significant 48.9% reduction in new varices noted in the per-protocol population with belapectin 2 mg. All enrolled subjects transitioned into a 36-month treatment period, with approximately 50 subjects completing the full 36 months to date. We are still analyzing the extensive data from the trial and anticipate providing multiple clinical updates from the subjects completing 36-month therapy, as well as additional biomarker data in Q1 2025.\u201d Joel Lewis, Chief Executive Officer at Galectin Therapeutics, added, \u201cWe remain optimistic about belapectin's potential as an important therapy for patients with MASH cirrhosis and portal hypertension, a population with an unmet medical need that we believe is much larger than current estimates suggest. I would like to extend our gratitude to the investigators, their staff, and the patients and their caregivers who participated in the NAVIGATE trial for their commitment and dedication. We look forward to sharing the additional results in the first quarter of 2025 and engaging with potential pharmaceutical partners and medical experts to determine the optimal next steps in belapectin\u2019s development.\u201d Dr. Naim Alkhouri, Chief Medical Officer and Director of the Steatotic Liver Program at Arizona Liver Health, added, \u201cI am encouraged by the results demonstrating an approximately 49% reduction in the development of varices in patients with MASH cirrhosis with the previously studied belapectin dose of 2 mg in such a large, global trial. I believe the results warrant further clinical development as belapectin could become a pivotal therapeutic option for these patients that currently do not have any treatment options.\u201d Dr. Naga Chalasani, David W. Crabb Professor of Gastroenterology and Hepatology and Adjunct Professor of Anatomy, Cell Biology & Physiology at Indiana University School of Medicine, stated, \u201cI have been involved with the belapectin development program in MASH cirrhosis since the beginning and am very pleased to see that prevention of esophageal varices in patients with MASH cirrhosis in this large NAVIGATE clinical trial confirmed the results that were seen in the previous trial conducted by Galectin in the 2 mg/kg cohort. Belapectin clearly is offering a reproducible benefit and should be continued in clinical development as there is a significant unmet need for patients with MASH cirrhosis.\u201d Based on results from previous clinical and preliminary nonclinical studies, as well as preliminary data from the NAVIGATE trial, the lack of increased efficacy at the 4 mg dose of belapectin is likely due to saturable binding dynamics and interactions with Galectin-3 proteins. Specifically, the 2 mg dose may provide optimal therapeutic effects, while the 4 mg and greater doses may provide more available circulating belapectin but will not lead to greater binding and an increase in pharmacodynamic effects, leading to saturable drug disposition and the appearance of reduced efficacy. The Company is performing further analysis on the pharmacodynamic data from the NAVIGATE trial. Additionally, the Company is currently conducting the full analysis of the NAVIGATE trial data and anticipates having additional data from approximately 50 patients that have completed 36-months of treatment with belapectin in early 2025. Once available, Galectin will provide clinical updates and determine next steps for belapectin development.

Financial Results for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 and Provides Business Update Galectin Therapeutics Inc. Thu, Nov 14, 2024, 4:00 PM 8 min read In This Article: GALT -1.60% Galectin Therapeutics Inc. NAVIGATE trial on track for top-line results in December 2024 NORCROSS, Ga., Nov. 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Galectin Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: GALT), the leading developer of therapeutics that target galectin proteins, today reported financial results and provided a business update for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Joel Lewis, Chief Executive Officer and President of Galectin Therapeutics, said \u201cThis past quarter, we remained laser-focus on advancing the NAVIGATE trial of belapectin in patients with MASH cirrhosis. As we eagerly await the topline results next month, we remain hopeful that belapectin may be a potential new treatment for the large number of patients in the U.S. with compensated cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and which have not developed esophageal varices. These patients represent a large unmet medical need.\u201d Khurram Jamil, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, added, \u201cWe are pleased to share that Galectin will present three posters highlighting important data from our belapectin program at the upcoming American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) 2024 meeting. Our presentations will discuss the central evaluation process of upper endoscopies for our novel primary endpoint, as well as the unique characteristics of the patient population enrolled in the NAVIGATE trial utilizing the latest clinical guidelines for portal hypertension.\u201d Belapectin Program Q3 2024 and Recent Highlights Belapectin is a complex carbohydrate drug that targets galectin-3, a critical protein in the pathogenesis of MASH and fibrosis. MASH Cirrhosis The NAVIGATE trial ( NCT04365868 ) evaluating the efficacy and safety of belapectin for the prevention of esophageal varices in MASH in 357 patients across 14 countries on five continents is progressing as planned. Based on feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Company has decided to analyze stage 1 of the NAVIGATE clinical trial results as a stand-alone trial. Therefore, full top-line efficacy and safety results, following last patient last visit and database lock which both have occurred recently, are expected to be presented in December 2024. At this point, the Company remains blinded to any data until after the Data Safety Monitoring Board meeting, which is expected in December 2024. Three abstracts on clinical data from the NAVIGATE trial in patients with MASH cirrhosis and portal hypertension have been accepted for poster presentation at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)\u2019s 2024 annual Liver Meeting, being held November 15-19, 2024, in San Diego, California. These posters cover the primary endpoint evaluation and patient population of the NAVIGATE trial. Story Continues 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders As previously announced, due to the expected top-line results of the NAVIGATE trial in December 2024, the Board of Directors established January 23, 2025, as the date of the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Q3 2024 Financial Highlights As of\u00a0September 30, 2024, the Company had\u00a0$27.1 million\u00a0of cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, the Company has $6 million available under a new line of credit provided by its chairman of the board to fund operations. The Company believes it has sufficient cash to fund currently planned operations and research and development activities through\u00a0May 2025. Research and development expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 were $7.6 million compared with $7.7 million for the same period in 2023. Overall, there was a moderate increase in expenditures related to our NAVIGATE clinical trial offset by lower preclinical and nonclinical costs. General and administrative expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $1.5 million, compared to $1.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported a net loss applicable to common stockholders of $11.2 million, or ($0.18) per share, compared to a net loss applicable to common stockholders of $14.0 million, or ($0.24) per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. These results are included in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as of and for the period ended September 30, 2024, which has been filed with the\u00a0U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u00a0and is available at www.sec.gov . About Galectin Therapeutics Galectin Therapeutics is dedicated to developing novel therapies to improve the lives of patients with chronic liver disease and cancer. Galectin\u2019s lead drug belapectin is a carbohydrate-based drug that inhibits the galectin-3 protein, which is directly involved in multiple inflammatory, fibrotic, and malignant diseases, for which it has Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The lead development program is in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH, formerly known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH) with cirrhosis, the most advanced form of MASH-related fibrosis. Liver cirrhosis is one of the most pressing medical needs and a significant drug development opportunity. Additional development programs are in treatment of combination immunotherapy for advanced head and neck cancers and other malignancies. Advancement of these additional clinical programs is largely dependent on finding a suitable partner. Galectin seeks to leverage extensive scientific and development expertise as well as established relationships with external sources to achieve cost-effective and efficient development.

Therapeutics\u2019 govorestat Pharmaceutical Technology \u00b7 Shutterstock / The KonG. Robert Barrie Thu, Nov 28, 2024, 3:02 PM 3 min read In This Article: APLT -4.09% The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has declined to approve Applied Therapeutics\u2019 govorestat for classic galactosemia, prolonging the wait for the first marketed treatment for the genetic disease. US-based Applied Therapeutics had been hoping its central nervous system (CNS)-penetrant aldose reductase inhibitor (ARI) would become the first pharmacological treatment for the disease. The FDA\u2019s complete response letter (CRL) cited deficiencies in Applied Therapeutics\u2019 new drug application (NDA), as per a 27 November press release. Shares in the Nasdaq-listed company sank 76% in after-hours trading following the announcement. Applied Therapeutics has a market cap of $997.1m. The FDA had previously requested extra time to decide on the drug earlier this year after extra data was submitted by Applied Therapeutics. The biopharma company said it is now reviewing feedback from the agency and plans to immediately meet with the FDA to discuss resubmitting the NDA or appealing the decision for its drug. There are around 3,300 patients in the US with galactosemia, an inherited metabolic disorder that affects the body\u2019s ability to properly convert galactose to glucose. A deficiency in the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridylyl transferase (GALT) causes a buildup of galactose, leading to an improper conversion to the toxic metabolite galactitol. Accumulation of this molecule causes neurological complications, including deficiencies in cognition, behaviour, and motor skills, as well as tremors. The only current treatment is the avoidance of galactose or lactose in diets, including those of newborns such as breast milk. Applied Therapeutics points to the \u201crapid and sustained reductions in galactitol\u201d produced by the govorestat in paediatric clinical trials. In the Phase III registrational ACTION-Galactosemia Kids study (NCT04902781) in children with galactosemia between the ages of two and 17, govorestat led to improvements in activities of daily living, behavioural symptoms, cognition, fine motor skills and tremors. Applied Therapeutics\u2019 CEO Shoshana Shendelman said: \u201cWe are disappointed by the FDA\u2019s decision today, [\u2026] govorestat has the potential to change the lives of patients with galactosemia, which we believe is evidenced by the breadth of efficacy and safety data demonstrating its ability to stop the decline on progressive clinical outcomes. \u201cWe plan to work with the FDA to address the concerns in the CRL and determine an expeditious path to bring this much-needed treatment to patients.\u201d Nicole Casale, president of the Galactosemia Foundation, stated: \u201cThe galactosemia community is devastated by the FDA's decision to not approve the first and currently only potential treatment for this ultra-rare, life-altering disease. Story Continues \u201cIndividuals facing this devastating disease need a treatment now. We urge the FDA to reconsider their decision on behalf of those facing this disease, their family members who love and care for them, and future generations who may be impacted by this genetic condition.\u201d Govorestat has a wealth of FDA tags designed to expedite market access, including orphan drug, paediatric rare disease, and fast track designations. The drug is also currently under review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), where it holds orphan medicinal product designation . \"Wait for galactosemia therapy goes on after FDA shuns Applied Therapeutics\u2019 govorestat\" was originally created and published by Pharmaceutical Technology , a GlobalData owned brand.

Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 4:00 PM 4 min read In This Article: GALT -1.60% Galectin Therapeutics Inc. Patient population for the NAVIGATE trial is based on non-invasive tests and clinical criteria utilizing latest treatment guidelines for portal hypertension in MASH cirrhosis Blinded central review system can be effectively set-up for evaluation of esophagogastoduodenoscopy (EGD) in large multi-center trial of patients with MASH cirrhosis and portal hypertension, facilitating utilization of this outcome as a critical endpoint in portal hypertension trials Approximately a third of patients with MASH cirrhosis and portal hypertension (PH) screened for the NAVIGATE trial had the incidental finding of varices on EGD, highlighting the need for screening EGDs in these patients NAVIGATE trial readout on track for December 2024 NORCROSS, Ga., Nov. 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Galectin Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: GALT), the leading developer of therapeutics that target galectin proteins, today announced the presentation of three posters on the ongoing NAVIGATE trial in patients with MASH cirrhosis and portal hypertension at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)\u2019s annual meeting 2024 Liver Meeting, being held November 15-19, 2024 in San Diego, California. \u201cWe are excited to share latest clinical data from our ongoing NAVIGATE trial of belapectin for the prevention of esophageal varices in patients with MASH cirrhosis and portal hypertension. We show that a centralized evaluation system can be designed for consistent and effective assessment of esophageal and gastric varices, which is critical for advancing clinical research in this population with high unmet need. We also provide an in depth look at baseline characteristics of the patient enrolled in our NAVIGATE trial,\u201d said Khurram Jamil, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Galectin Therapeutics. \u201cIn another key finding, our research reveals that among patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis with reduced platelet counts and radiologic signs of portal hypertension, approximately one-third have detectable esophageal varices upon screening. These findings underscore the need for reliable screening and targeted therapies in this vulnerable patient population. These clinical data are of great importance as we look forward to sharing the readout of our NAVIGATE trial before the end of the year.\u201d The following posters highlighting clinical data will be presented at the \u201cPortal Hypertension and Other Complications of Cirrhosis\u201d session taking place 8:00 am \u2013 5:00 pm on November 18, 2024: Poster #4118: Evaluation of esophageal and gastric varices in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension: a central evaluation system for clinical research. Presenter: Naim Alkhouri, M.D., Arizona Liver Health, Chandler, AZ. Story Continues Poster #4063: Baseline patients\u2019 characteristics from NAVIGATE, a seamless adaptive Phase 2b/3 trial of Belapectin in MASH cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Presenter: Khurram Jamil, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Galectin Therapeutics. Poster #4125: In patients with compensated MASH cirrhosis with platelet count < 150,000/\u00b5L and radiologic findings of portal hypertension, a third are identified with esophageal varices on screening Esophago-Gastroduodenoscopy. Presenter: Laura Ladron deGuevar, M.D., CIAID - Centro de Investigacion y Atencion Integral Durango, S.C. The three abstracts are available for viewing by attendees on the AASLD website and will also be featured in the October supplement to the AASLD journal, Hepatology . About Galectin Therapeutics Galectin Therapeutics is dedicated to developing novel therapies to improve the lives of patients with chronic liver disease and cancer. Galectin\u2019s lead drug belapectin is a carbohydrate-based drug that inhibits the galectin-3 protein, which is directly involved in multiple inflammatory, fibrotic, and malignant diseases, for which it has Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The lead development program is in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH, formerly known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH) with cirrhosis, the most advanced form of MASH-related fibrosis. Liver cirrhosis is one of the most pressing medical needs and a significant drug development opportunity. Additional development programs are in treatment of combination immunotherapy for advanced head and neck cancers and other malignancies. Advancement of these additional clinical programs is largely dependent on finding a suitable partner. Galectin seeks to leverage extensive scientific and development expertise as well as established relationships with external sources to achieve cost-effective and efficient development.

Crowdfunding Campaign to Fund Innovative Automated Valuation Model (AVM) for Net Lease Market PR Newswire Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 4:59 PM 3 min read MIAMI BEACH, Fla. , Nov. 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0Net-Trade Ventures, a pioneering Proptech platform specializing in the Net Lease (NNN) commercial real estate sector, announced the launch of its crowdfunding campaign on WeFunder . The campaign will raise funds to develop a groundbreaking Automated Valuation Model (AVM) designed explicitly for the Net Lease market, filling a critical need for accurate, niche-specific valuation insights in this $1 trillion asset class. The Net Lease market, encompassing properties leased to major retail, fast food/QSR, and convenience/gas brands, is highly attractive due to its passive income potential. However, data and valuation tools currently available are limited, as existing MLS and sales comp platforms cater to broader commercial real estate categories, lacking depth in the unique valuation metrics Net Lease properties require. Addressing Key Gaps in the Market The Net-Trade AVM will transform how Net Lease assets are valued by integrating a unique ecosystem of property, location, and tenant data. This will enable buyers, sellers, and investors to gain accurate, real-time valuations and rankings crucial for informed decision-making. Leveraging AI, machine learning, predictive analysis, and proprietary algorithms, the AVM will provide unmatched insight into asset values and market trends, setting a new standard for valuation in the Net Lease industry. \"By creating a specialized AVM for Net Lease, we're addressing a significant gap in the market,\" said Quentin Foster , Founder and CEO of Net-Trade Ventures. \"This tool will empower stakeholders to make faster, more knowledge-based decisions for acquisitions, dispositions, and asset management, revolutionizing how valuations are conducted and applied in this niche market.\" This next phase builds on the successful foundation of Net-Trade's MLS platform, which has already onboarded over 4,000 listings from top brokers nationwide. With an estimated 400,000 Net Lease properties in the U.S. and $30 billion in annual transaction volume, the demand for precise valuation tools is immense. Net-Trade's AVM will bring much-needed specificity and efficiency to this underserved commercial real estate market segment. Recently recognized by GlobeSt. as a 2024 Influencer in Net Lease , Net-Trade Ventures continues to lead innovation in the sector. The company's expertise and dedication to the Net Lease market have set it apart as a valuable resource for brokers, investors, and property owners.

mural in memory of longtime staffer Wes Bowers, Lodi News-Sentinel, Calif. Wed, Nov 13, 2024, 11:52 PM 3 min read Nov. 13\u2014ACAMPO \u2014 Last year, the Oak View Elementary School community lost one of its longest-serving members. Terry Delaney, who passed away on Nov. 10, 2023, spent 25 years as a teacher's aide, bus driver and librarian at the school. On Tuesday, faculty and staff unveiled a mural dedicated in Delaney's memory, located on the front exterior wall of the campus library. \"It's the perfect embodiment of everything she stands for,\" Principal and Superintendent Beverly Boone said. \"I think it's just going to be a beautiful addition to the front of the library for the kids.\" The mural, commissioned by Lodi artist Tony Segale, features renderings of the books \"Oh, the Places You'll Go!\" by Dr. Seuss and \"Where the Wild Things Are\" by Maurice Sendak, as well as a yellow rose, all set on a \"Seussical\" background. \"It's just so personal,\" Boone said of the mural. \"Even though we knew (what it would look like) the color and how personal ... it is was more than we expected.\" Rachael Romine, the school's curriculum director, said the Seuss and Sendak books represented Delaney's love for story time, and the yellow rose represented her love for vibrant colors. She said Delaney would decorate the library with yellow roses and sunflowers throughout the year. Sunflowers were placed on a table outside the library Tuesday morning, accompanied by a framed photo of the beloved librarian. \"Terri loved story time and used Dr. Seuss many years in a row,\" Romine said. \"Some of our parents, and even some of our teachers, are students that Terri would read some of those books to. She loved all children's literature. She really wanted that interaction with them and to show them that there was more than just pictures, but pictures helped also.\" Sarah Delaney said her mother-in-law loved being a librarian, and loved Oak View, adding she always shared stories of the library with her family. Delaney said her mother-in-law kept countless numbers of notes, letters, drawings and knick-knacks from students during her 25 years at the school. She hoped the mural would remind students of the love and laughter they shared with the librarian over the years. \"It's hard to believe it's already been a year since Ms. Delaney passed, \"Sarah Delaney said. \"The first year is always the hardest. There are times in all of our lives that will seem unfair, and losing Ms. Delaney so young is definitely one of those.\" She added that the family has found comfort in knowing Delaney will always be a part of Oak View, and that the school will be a part of her legacy. Story Continues Born in Lodi in 1956, Delaney graduated from Lodi High School in 1974. She spent much of her adult life in Galt before settling in Lockeford, according to her obituary. She loved to volunteer at Horizon Community Church and enjoyed being outdoors, kayaking, traveling, playing cards and reading. She loved watching the television show \"Survivor,\" and never missed a season. \"She's missed every day,\" Boone said. \"We lost her suddenly and unexpectedly. It wasn't her time to go. She was not only an employee here, she was a family member and a grandmother to some of our students. The library was always like a warm place for them.\" View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard Recommended Stories", "symbol": "GALT", "date": "2024-11-13T20:52:00+00:00", "sentiment":
