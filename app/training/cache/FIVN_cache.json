"Five9 Trades at a Premium EV/EBITDA Value: How to Play the Stock Vasundhara Sawalka Mon, Jan 20, 2025, 6:48 PM 4 min read In This Article: FIVN -1.22% Despite Five9 's FIVN compelling growth story and AI-driven potential, its current valuation metrics suggest investors might want to exercise caution and wait for a better entry point in 2025. The stock's significant 53.1% decline in the past year warrants a careful analysis of both fundamentals and valuation before making investment decisions. 1-Year Performance Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Valuation Analysis Five9's premium valuation is reflected in its trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 31.77x, which stands significantly above the Zacks Internet - Software industry average of 7.88x. Trading at more than four times its peer group average raises questions about the stock's near-term upside potential. While high-growth technology companies often command premium valuations, this substantial deviation from industry norms suggests the stock might be priced for perfection, leaving minimal room for execution missteps or market disappointments. FIVN\u2019s EV/EBITDA TTM Ratio Depicts Stretched Valuation Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Business Fundamentals The company's underlying business metrics demonstrate continued strength. Its fourth-quarter 2024 results showed encouraging growth with total revenues increasing 15% year over year to $264.2 million, while subscription revenues, representing nearly 80% of total revenues, accelerated to 20% growth. The adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 19.8%, and quarterly operating cash flow reached a record $41 million, indicating improving operational efficiency and profitability. AI Leadership and Enterprise Growth Five9's AI initiatives are gaining significant traction, evidenced by AI products contributing over 20% of the enterprise\u2019s new logo Annual Contract Value bookings in the third quarter. The average deal size, including AI components, was five times larger than those without AI over the last four quarters, suggesting strong market demand for AI-enhanced solutions. Additionally, the growth in $1M+ ARR customers, now representing approximately 56% of subscription revenues with 29% year-over-year growth, demonstrates successful enterprise market penetration. Strategic Position and Competition The company maintains strong strategic partnerships, particularly its eight-year relationship with Microsoft, and continues to innovate with features like the recently launched bi-directional presence capability. However, the CCaaS market is becoming increasingly competitive, with both established players and new entrants investing heavily in AI capabilities. This intensifying competition from major CCaaS providers like Twilio TWLO, RingCentral RNG and Zoom ZM Contact Center could pressure growth rates and margins in the future. Story Continues 2025 Outlook Management's preliminary guidance for 2025 suggests revenues of $1.13 billion, with expectations to surpass the current street consensus of $2.52 for non-GAAP EPS. While these projections demonstrate confidence in continued growth and margin expansion, much of this optimism appears to be reflected in the current valuation multiples. For fourth-quarter 2024, Five9 projects revenues between $267 million and $268 million and non-GAAP net income per share in the range of 69-71 cents, suggesting continued growth momentum heading into 2025. The company's focus on balancing growth with profitability is evident in its improving financial metrics and operational efficiency. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 indicates 13.21% year-over-year revenue growth to $1.03 billion. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.37 per share, suggesting a 15.61% rise year over year. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Find the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar . Investment Strategy Given the premium valuation and market uncertainties, investors might benefit from a patient approach to building positions in Five9. Several factors support this conservative stance. The high EV/EBITDA multiple indicates limited room for further multiple expansion, suggesting potential vulnerability to any execution missteps or market volatility. Macroeconomic uncertainties could continue to pressure high-multiple software stocks, potentially creating better entry points. Additionally, rising competition in the CCaaS market might impact growth rates and pricing power. Conclusion While Five9's long-term growth prospects remain attractive, supported by strong AI momentum and enterprise customer growth, current valuation levels warrant caution. Trading at an EV/EBITDA of 31.77x versus the industry average of 7.88x suggests limited near-term upside potential. For investors interested in the stock, a prudent approach would be to wait for valuation multiples to normalize, monitor quarterly execution and consider gradual position building through dollar-cost averaging. Though the company's market position and AI-driven strategy remain compelling, the premium valuation combined with market uncertainties makes waiting for a better entry point in 2025 a sensible strategy.

(NASDAQ:FIVN) Trading At A 46% Discount? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 2:02 PM 6 min read In This Article: FIVN -1.22% Key Insights Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Five9 fair value estimate is US$69.25 Current share price of US$37.39 suggests Five9 is potentially 46% undervalued The US$52.87 analyst price target for FIVN is 24% less than our estimate of fair value In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Five9, Inc. ( NASDAQ:FIVN ) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple! Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model . See our latest analysis for Five9 Is Five9 Fairly Valued? We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$150.3m US$190.4m US$227.4m US$260.1m US$288.3m US$312.5m US$333.2m US$351.4m US$367.5m US$382.3m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x3 Est @ 26.63% Est @ 19.42% Est @ 14.38% Est @ 10.85% Est @ 8.38% Est @ 6.65% Est @ 5.44% Est @ 4.60% Est @ 4.00% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.0% US$139 US$163 US$181 US$191 US$196 US$197 US$195 US$190 US$184 US$177 (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.8b We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.6%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.0%. Story Continues Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$382m\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (8.0%\u2013 2.6%) = US$7.3b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = US$7.3b\u00f7 ( 1 + 8.0%) 10 = US$3.4b The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$5.2b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$37.4, the company appears quite undervalued at a 46% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. NasdaqGM:FIVN Discounted Cash Flow January 21st 2025 The Assumptions Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Five9 as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.302. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for Five9 Strength Net debt to equity ratio below 40%. Weakness No major weaknesses identified for FIVN. Opportunity Forecast to reduce losses next year. Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows. Good value based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value. Threat Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow. Looking Ahead: Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Five9, we've compiled three essential aspects you should consider: Risks : Every company has them, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Five9 you should know about. Management :Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for FIVN's future outlook?

Buy? Zacks Equity Research Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 4:56 PM 6 min read In This Article: NTAP -1.95% NetApp \u2019s NTAP shares have proven resilient, with a 37.8% gain in the past year, outpacing the industry\u2019s growth of 10.7%. NetApp provides enterprise storage as well as data management software and hardware products and services. It has also outperformed the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500 composite\u2019s growth of 27.8% and 24.8%, respectively. Closing at $122.09 in the last trading session, NTAP stock is currently trading 9.9% below its 52-week high of $135.45, attained on Nov. 22, 2024. Price Performance Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research With the pullback from 52-week high along with strong business momentum, is NTAP an attractive investment opportunity? Let us discuss NTAP\u2019s prospects and ascertain how to strategize investment. NTAP\u2019s Flash & Public Cloud Business Key Drivers NetApp is witnessing higher demand from customers for its portfolio of modern all-flash arrays, especially the C-series capacity flash and ASA block-optimized flash. The new all-flash A-series is also picking up momentum. These enterprise storage products will allow users to boost workloads including traditional enterprise applications and Gen AI. The company expects the new AFF A-series, along with its C-series and ASA products, to capture further share in the all-flash market. In the fiscal second quarter, the company\u2019s All-Flash Array Business\u2019s annualized net revenue run rate was $3.8 billion, up 19% year over year. Total billings rose 9% year over year to $1.59 billion. Also, Keystone\u2019s storage-as-a-service offering has been gaining significant traction, with revenues increasing more than 55% year over year in the fiscal second quarter. Unbilled RPO was $330 million, up 11% quarter over quarter. Unbilled RPO is a key indicator of Keystone's growth. Solid momentum in hyperscaler first-party and marketplace storage services has been driving revenues from the Public Cloud. The Public Cloud segment comprises revenues from products delivered as a service and related supports. The portfolio contains cloud automation and optimization services, storage and cloud infrastructure monitoring services. Public Cloud segment\u2019s revenues improved 9% to $168 million, driven by 43% increase in first-party and marketplace cloud storage services. Driven by strength in the cloud storage business, NetApp now expects cloud revenues to return to double-digit growth year over year from the current quarter. NTAP Raises Outlook Driven by strong year-to-date performance and strength in flash, block, cloud and AI, NetApp now expects full-year revenues in the range of $6.54-$6.74 billion, up 6% year over year at the mid-point. Earlier it anticipated sales in the band of $6.48-$6.68 billion. The company now forecasts non-GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2025 to be between $7.20 and $7.40, up 13% year over year at the mid-point. Earlier, it expected non-GAAP earnings between $7 and $7.20 per share. For fiscal 2025, NetApp continues to expect non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 71-72%. Non-GAAP operating margin is anticipated in the band of 28-28.5% compared with 27-28%. NetApp recently inked a definitive agreement to divest its Spot by NetApp FinOps business to Flexera, a global technology spend and risk management player. NetApp acquired cloud services startup \u2013\u2013 Spot \u2013\u2013 in July 2020.\u00a0 The divesture aligns seamlessly with NetApp\u2019s vision of fostering long-term growth and innovation in the intelligent data infrastructure. While the financial details of the transaction remain undisclosed, the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Story Continues AI Momentum Long-term Growth Driver for NTAP Apart from the demand for flash and block, increasing demand for NetApp\u2019s cloud storage and AI solutions bodes well. In the fiscal second quarter, the company won more than 100 AI and data lake modernization deals. The company is also working on the development of GenAI cloud and on-premises solutions in collaboration with industry behemoths. NetApp expanded its partnership with Google Cloud to provide the foundational data storage for the Google Distributed Cloud and make AI-ready infrastructure available to the public sector and other highly regulated industries. NetApp's intelligent data infrastructure, bolstered by ONTAP and StorageGRID solutions, empowers its customers to efficiently scale workloads and harness AI while ensuring security and regulatory compliance. Google Distributed Cloud will also use these capabilities to enhance its services, including databases, AI and analytics. NTAP\u2019s Healthy Capital Allocation Strategy Management\u2019s execution has been favorable in recent times. NetApp\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and investments was $2.22 billion while long-term debt was $1.244 billion as of Oct. 25, 2024. For the fiscal second quarter, the company generated net cash from operations was $105 million and free cash flow was $60 million. Net cash balance provides the required flexibility to pursue any growth strategy, whether through acquisitions or otherwise. A strong balance sheet helps NetApp to continue its shareholder-friendly initiatives of dividend payouts. The company returned $406 million to its shareholders as dividend payouts and share repurchases in the last reported quarter. The company has $800 million worth of shares remaining under its existing authorization. NetApp also announced a dividend of 52 cents per share payable on Jan. 22, 2025, to its shareholders of record as of the close of business on Jan. 3.

Mean for the Stock? Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 8:00 PM 3 min read In This Article: FIVN -1.22% Investors might want to bet on Five9 (FIVN), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change. The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system. The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Five9 basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price. Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock. For Five9, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher. Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>. Story Continues Earnings Estimate Revisions for Five9 This provider of cloud-based software to call centers is expected to earn $2.37 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2024, which represents a year-over-year change of 15.6%. Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Five9. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 568.5%. Bottom Line Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term. You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>> The upgrade of Five9 to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.
