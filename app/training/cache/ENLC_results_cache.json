Trump 2.0's Inaugural Speech Abhinab Dasgupta Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 4:07 PM 3 min read In This Article: CNX +0.80% Since the supply shock of 2022, the energy sector has been driven by growth in oil refiners who have benefited from favorable spreads between the price of oil and its distillates. However, growth has not been limited to refiners, with explorers and producers, equipment and services gaining ground as well. Geopolitical factors have played the most significant role, as they did in 2022. The threat of a broader conflict with Iran has increased with the inauguration of President Donald J. Trump. U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil exports can compound, driving up prices. Iran remains one of the top 10 global oil producers. However, the biggest driver of growth in the sector might be Trump revoking bans on offshore oil and gas drilling in most U.S. coastal waters as he famously announced that America was going to \u201cDrill, baby, Drill\u201d in his inaugural speech. Trump\u2019s moves are being looked at as nullifying executive orders made by President Biden, which includes revoking his recent decision to bar drilling rigs in around 625 million acres of coastal waters. The Trump administration expects that new offshore oil auctions will be a way to raise federal revenue. Also, if Trump were to act on his warnings and raise tariffs by 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico \u2014 something that he has not yet officially signed but says that he expects to do by Feb. 1 \u2014 the pressure on Canadian crude prices will push oil prices up again. Oil prices were little changed on Tuesday, falling 1 cent, or 0.01%, to close at $80.14/barrel, as investors took stock of Donald Trump's visions about boosting oil and gas production in the U.S. Brent crude. WTI crude slid 60 cents, or 0.8%, to $76.79/barrel. However, with the day being a public holiday, there were no settlements. The Trump administration has withdrawn from the Paris Climate Accords, again. It will be safe to gauge that with \u201cDrill, baby, Drill\u201d being a policy direction, energy and oil in particular might be entering a phase of tremendous activity. It will be prudent to look into stocks that are currently well placed to invest into. Our Choices The stocks below flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Rank #2 (Buy).

(VLO) Soars 4.9%: Is Further Upside Left in the Stock? Zacks Equity Research Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 3:32 PM 2 min read In This Article: VLO +2.39% Valero Energy (VLO) shares ended the last trading session 4.9% higher at $133.35. The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 1.5% loss over the past four weeks. The bullishness could be attributed to the new sanctions imposed by the U.S. on Russian crude oil exports. These sanctions disrupted the global supply of oil, causing a spike in oil prices as markets anticipated tighter global supplies. Higher oil prices can improve margins for integrated refiners like VLO, as they can pass on increased costs to consumers through higher refined product prices. Additionally, Valero\u2019s refinery network and Gulf Coast operations have been significant drivers of its stock performance. This oil refiner is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.16 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -95.5%. Revenues are expected to be $30.43 billion, down 14.1% from the year-ago quarter. Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements. For Valero Energy, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 17.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. And a negative trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't usually translate into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on VLO going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The Special Meeting will be held virtually. All EnLink unitholders of record as of the close of business on Dec. 23, 2024 , will be entitled to vote their units at the Special Meeting. The EnLink Board of Directors and the Conflicts Committee of the EnLink Board of Directors unanimously recommend that unitholders vote \"FOR\" all proposals provided in detail in the definitive proxy statement. Proxy materials are expected to be mailed on or about Dec. 31, 2024 . Completion of the acquisition is subject to the approval of a majority of the outstanding EnLink common units (including common units owned by ONEOK) and other customary closing conditions. ONEOK has committed to vote its units in favor of the transaction. No ONEOK shareholder vote is required to complete the transaction. As previously announced on Nov. 24, 2024 , ONEOK will acquire all outstanding units of EnLink in a tax-free transaction in which each outstanding common unit of EnLink that ONEOK does not already own will be converted into 0.1412 shares of ONEOK common stock. The combination of ONEOK and EnLink establishes a fully integrated Permian Basin platform at scale and further expands and extends ONEOK's footprint in the Mid-Continent, North Texas and Louisiana . The transaction is expected to provide significant synergies through complementary asset positions and support ONEOK's strong balance sheet and capital allocation strategy. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, subject to approval by EnLink unitholders and other customary closing conditions.

Earnings and Revenues Lag Estimates Zacks Equity Research Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 3:05 AM 3 min read In This Article: ENLC -0.21% NR -4.86% EnLink Midstream (ENLC) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.06 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.13 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.10 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -53.85%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this natural gas company would post earnings of $0.12 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.07, delivering a surprise of -41.67%. Over the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates. EnLink Midstream , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, posted revenues of $1.61 billion for the quarter ended September 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.81%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.75 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. EnLink Midstream shares have added about 26% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 21.2%. What's Next for EnLink Midstream? While EnLink Midstream has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for EnLink Midstream: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.19 on $2.17 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.47 on $7.14 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year. Story Continues Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

We define free cash flow after distributions as adjusted EBITDA, net to ENLC, plus (less) (growth and maintenance capital expenditures, excluding capital expenditures that were contributed by other entities and relate to the non-controlling interest share of our consolidated entities); (interest expense, net of interest income); (distributions declared on common units); (cash distributions earned by the Series B Preferred Units and the Series C Preferred Units); (payment to redeem mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest); (costs associated with the relocation of processing facilities, excluding costs that were contributed by other entities and relate to the non-controlling interest share of our consolidated entities); non-cash interest (income)/expense; (contributions to investment in unconsolidated affiliates); (payments to terminate interest rate swaps); (current income taxes); (earnout payments related to the Amarillo Rattler Acquisition and the Central Oklahoma Acquisition); (non-cash gain associated with a lease modification); and proceeds from the sale of equipment and land. EnLink believes these measures are useful to investors because they may provide users of this financial information with meaningful comparisons between current results and previously-reported results and a meaningful measure of the company's cash flow after it has satisfied the capital and related requirements of its operations. In addition, adjusted EBITDA is used as a metric in our short-term incentive program for compensating employees and in our performance awards for executives. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow after distributions, as defined above, are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP. They should not be considered in isolation or as an indicator of EnLink's performance. Furthermore, they should not be seen as a substitute for metrics prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the following tables. See EnLink's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for more information. Other definitions and explanations of terms used in this press release: Segment profit (loss) is defined as revenues, less cost of sales (exclusive of operating expenses and depreciation and amortization), less operating expenses. Segment profit (loss) includes non-cash compensation expenses reflected in operating expenses. See \"Item 8.

Acquire Remaining Publicly Held Common Units in EnLink Midstream in a Tax-Free Transaction PR Newswire Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 5:03 AM 12 min read In This Article: ENLC -0.21% OKE +1.55% Consideration of 0.1412 shares of ONEOK common stock for each outstanding publicly held EnLink common unit TULSA, Okla. , Nov. 24, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) (\"ONEOK\") and EnLink Midstream, LLC (NYSE: ENLC) (\"EnLink\") today announced that they have executed a definitive merger agreement under which ONEOK will acquire all of the outstanding publicly held common units of EnLink for $4.3 billion in ONEOK common stock. ONEOK, Inc. logo Under the agreement, each outstanding common unit of EnLink that ONEOK does not already own will be converted into 0.1412 shares of ONEOK common stock. The exchange ratio was derived by dividing $15.75 per unit, equal to EnLink's market close price on Nov. 22, 2024 , by ONEOK's 10-day volume-weighted average price (VWAP). In the aggregate, ONEOK will issue approximately 37.0 million shares in connection with the proposed transaction, representing approximately 6.0% of the total ONEOK shares outstanding upon consummation of the transaction. The Board of Directors of the managing member of EnLink (the \"EnLink Board\") delegated to the Conflicts Committee of such board, consisting of three independent directors, the authority to review, evaluate, negotiate and approve the transaction. The EnLink Conflicts Committee, after evaluating the transaction with its independent legal and financial advisors, unanimously determined that the transaction is in the best interests of EnLink and the public unitholders and approved the transaction. The EnLink Conflicts Committee recommended approval of the transaction to the EnLink Board, which also unanimously approved the transaction. Subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, completion of the transaction is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2025. The completion of the merger is subject to the approval of a majority of the outstanding EnLink common units (including common units owned by ONEOK) and other customary closing conditions. ONEOK has committed to vote its units, representing approximately 44% of the outstanding EnLink common units, in favor of the transaction. No ONEOK shareholder vote is required to complete the transaction. In addition, no further regulatory approval is necessary, as ONEOK filed under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in connection with its previously announced acquisition of the controlling interest in EnLink, and the necessary waiting period, including for this transaction, has been completed. \"This tax-free transaction to acquire the remaining outstanding EnLink units is expected to be accretive to ONEOK shareholders and provide EnLink unitholders with significantly greater trading liquidity and an attractive dividend yield,\" said Pierce H. Norton II , ONEOK president and chief executive officer. Story Continues \"ONEOK has a longstanding reputation as being intentional in building a premier energy infrastructure company. This next step further solidifies that status, allowing us to continue expanding and extending our value chain, while creating value for our stakeholders.\" On Oct. 15, 2024 , ONEOK announced the successful completion of its acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners' (GIP) entire interest in EnLink for a total cash consideration of approximately $3.3 billion . ADVISORS: Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC is serving as lead financial advisor to ONEOK. Barclays and Citi also advised ONEOK. Kirkland & Ellis LLP is serving as ONEOK's legal advisor. Evercore is acting as financial advisor and Richards, Layton & Finger, P.A. is acting as legal advisor to the EnLink Conflicts Committee, and Baker Botts L.L.P. is acting as legal advisor to EnLink.

EnLink Acquisition, $4.3 Billion Deal Unveiled Lekha Gupta Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 2:41 PM 2 min read In This Article: OKE +1.55% ENLC -0.21% ONEOK Bolsters Portfolio With EnLink Acquisition, $4.3 Billion Deal Unveiled EnLink Midstream, LLC (NYSE: ENLC ) shares traded higher premarket on Monday after it disclosed a merger deal with ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE ) for $4.3 billion. As per the deal, each EnLink common unit not owned by ONEOK will be exchanged for 0.1412 shares of ONEOK stock. This exchange ratio reflects EnLink\u2019s closing price of $15.75 on November 22, 2024, divided by ONEOK\u2019s 10-day volume-weighted average price (VWAP). ONEOK will issue approximately 37 million shares, representing about 6% of its total shares outstanding after the transaction. ONEOK, which holds approximately 44% of EnLink\u2019s common units, has committed to voting in favor of the transaction. The transaction, subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025. The merger\u2019s completion requires approval from a majority of EnLink\u2019s outstanding common units, including those owned by ONEOK, and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. Pierce H. Norton II, ONEOK president and chief executive officer, said, \u201cThis tax-free transaction to acquire the remaining outstanding EnLink units is expected to be accretive to ONEOK shareholders and provide EnLink unitholders with significantly greater trading liquidity and an attractive dividend yield.\u201d In October 15, 2024, ONEOK disclosed the successful completion of its acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners\u2019 (GIP) entire interest in EnLink for a total cash consideration of approximately\u00a0$3.3 billion . Investors can gain exposure to the OKE stock via Global X MLP & Energy Infrastructure ETF (NYSE: MLPX ) and Tortoise North American Pipeline ETF (NYSE: TPYP ).

Earnings - But Analysts Have Updated Their Models editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sun, Nov 10, 2024, 3:25 PM 3 min read In This Article: ENLC -0.21% The analysts might have been a bit too bullish on EnLink Midstream, LLC ( NYSE:ENLC ), given that the company fell short of expectations when it released its third-quarter results last week. It looks like quite a negative result overall, with both revenues and earnings falling well short of analyst predictions. Revenues of US$1.6b missed by 19%, and statutory earnings per share of US$0.03 fell short of forecasts by 78%. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year. View our latest analysis for EnLink Midstream NYSE:ENLC Earnings and Revenue Growth November 10th 2024 Taking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from EnLink Midstream's five analysts is for revenues of US$8.80b in 2025. This reflects a substantial 32% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to shoot up 146% to US$0.70. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$8.77b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.72 in 2025. The analysts seem to have become a little more negative on the business after the latest results, given the minor downgrade to their earnings per share numbers for next year. The consensus price target held steady at US$15.45, with the analysts seemingly voting that their lower forecast earnings are not expected to lead to a lower stock price in the foreseeable future. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. Currently, the most bullish analyst values EnLink Midstream at US$17.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$15.00. The narrow spread of estimates could suggest that the business' future is relatively easy to value, or thatthe analysts have a strong view on its prospects. One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. The analysts are definitely expecting EnLink Midstream's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 25% annualised growth to the end of 2025 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 9.0% per annum over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 3.0% per year. It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect EnLink Midstream to grow faster than the wider industry. Story Continues The Bottom Line The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$15.45, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets. Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.

$4.3 bln in stock Investing.com Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 5:33 AM 1 min read In This Article: OKE +1.55% ENLC -0.21% Investing.com-- ONEOK Inc (NYSE:OKE) said it will buy the remainder of EnLink Midstream LLC (NYSE:ENLC) shares it does not hold in an all-stock deal, as the pipeline operator looks to boost its position in the Permian and Mid-Continent basins. ONEOK will offer 0.1412 shares for each common share of EnLink, representing a per-share value of $16.52746. The figure is a 4.7% premium to EnLink\u2019s close on Friday, and values a roughly 57% stake in the midstream operator at $4.3 billion. ONEOK said it had executed a definitive merger agreement with EnLink, and will issue about 37 million shares for the transaction. The move comes after ONEOK earlier this year bought the entirety of Global Infrastructure Partners\u2019 stake in EnLink- representing a 43% stake in the firm- for about $3.3 billion. ONEOK had said it would buy the remainder of all publicly-traded shares in the firm later in the year. ONEOK had also bought GIP\u2019s stake in Medallion Midstream for $2.6 billion in cash, amid a broader consolidation in the U.S. pipeline and storage industry. The U.S. oil industry is expected to pick up in the coming years, especially as President-elect Donald Trump vowed to ramp up local energy production.

Announces Deal to Acquire Remaining EnLink Stock for $4.3B Zacks Equity Research Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 4:42 PM 3 min read In This Article: OKE +1.55% ET +1.37% ONEOK, Inc. OKE announced that it has signed a definitive merger agreement, under which it will acquire all of the outstanding publicly held common units of EnLink Midstream ENLC for $4.3 billion in ONEOK common stock. This new deal was initiated after ONEOK successfully completed its acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners' entire interest in EnLink on Oct. 15, 2024, for a total cash consideration of nearly $3.3 billion. Key Details of OKE\u2019s Merger Deal As per the agreement, each outstanding common unit of EnLink that ONEOK does not already own will be converted into 0.1412 shares of ONEOK common stock. The exchange ratio was calculated by dividing the 10-day volume-weighted average price of ONEOK by $15.75 per unit, which was the market close price of EnLink on Nov. 22, 2024. ONEOK will issue around 37 million shares in relation to the proposed deal, which amounts to roughly 6% of all ONEOK shares that will be outstanding when the deal is completed. ONEOK agreed to support the deal by voting its units, which account for about 44% of the remaining EnLink common units. To finish the deal, no vote from ONEOK shareholders is needed. The deal is expected to be closed in the first quarter of 2025. Merger & Acquisitions in Oil & Gas Sector Here are some oil and gas companies that are also focused on expanding their operations through mergers and acquisitions. Energy Transfer ET recently completed the acquisition of WTG Midstream Holdings LLC. The firm paid $2.28 billion in cash and nearly 50.8 million newly issued ET common units to complete the agreement. This acquisition expanded Energy Transfer\u2019s presence in the Midland Basin by adding 6,000 miles of complementary gas-gathering pipelines in the region. The partnership expects the WTG assets to add approximately 4 cents of distributable cash flow per common unit in 2025, increasing to approximately 7 cents per common unit in 2027. ET\u2019s long-term (three to five-year) earnings growth rate is 23.24%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings per unit indicates a year-over-year increase of 22.9%. TotalEnergies SE TTE: During the third quarter of 2024, it acquired $1.8 billion worth of assets. These strategic acquisitions should assist the company in further expanding its multi-energy assets worldwide. TTE\u2019s long-term earnings growth rate is 3.91%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings per share indicates a year-over-year decrease of 16.1%. OKE\u2019s Stock Price Performance Over the past three months, ONEOK\u2019s shares have risen 32.1% compared with the industry\u2019s 18.3% growth.
