Sell the Company CLEVELAND, January 27, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Ancora Holdings Group, LLC (collectively with its affiliates, \"Ancora\" or \"we\"), a diversified investment firm that oversees approximately $10 billion in assets, today issued the below open letter to the Board of Directors (the \"Board\") of United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) (\"U.S. Steel\" or the \"Company\") regarding a variety of issues, including the Company\u2019s recently blocked sale to Nippon Steel Corporation (\"Nippon\"). To receive important updates, visit www.MakeUSSteelGreatAgain.com . *** January 27, 2025 United States Steel Corporation 600 Grant Street Pittsburgh, PA 15219 Attn: The Board Dear Members of the Board, Ancora is a growing shareholder of U.S. Steel. As an investment firm with deep roots in the Midwest, we have an affinity for the industrial and logistics companies that collectively form the backbone of America\u2019s economy. We are proud to be investors in companies such as Berry Global Group, Inc., Norfolk Southern Corporation, RB Global, Inc. and now U.S. Steel. Owning these types of businesses enables us to pursue strong risk-adjusted returns while helping support American competitiveness, job creation and wage growth. Although we understand why the Board explored strategic alternatives in 2023, its ultimate decision to ignore national security and pursue a risky sale to Nippon \u2013 an overseas bidder that came in just $1 per share higher than a competing domestic bidder \u2013 has led to a dead end. There appears to be no legal basis and no precedent for U.S. Steel\u2019s costly litigation over the Presidential Executive Order blocking the transaction. Moreover, President Donald Trump is a vocal opponent of the deal and long-term proponent of strengthening America\u2019s domestic manufacturing base. He also has long-held skepticism about foreign direct investment from Japan based on his own business dealings dating back to the 1980s. We see no reason to believe that President Trump, a high-conviction businessman who was elected by middle-class and working-class voters, is going to contradict his self-described \"America First\" agenda and disregard the opposition of the United Steelworkers. Story Continues The Board\u2019s choice to double down on its extremely poor decision to pursue a sale to Nippon has also kept U.S. Steel in a corroded state. Chief Executive Officer David Burritt, who stood to rake in more than $70 million himself if the sale had been consummated, has been allowed to misallocate capital, issue unreliable and overoptimistic forecasts, and repeatedly miss financial targets. It seems the Board failed to keep Mr. Burritt\u2019s attention on efficiency, execution and risk management as steel prices remained depressed over the past year. Rather than finally acknowledge the Company\u2019s perilous trajectory and try to course correct, the Board remains steadfastly committed to an underperforming leader who apparently lacks the ability and vision to bring U.S. Steel back from a busted transaction. In light of these alarming decisions and the unjustifiable deference to Mr. Burritt, who has made clear through outlandish rhetoric that he is self-interested and unfit for leadership, Ancora has nominated nine highly qualified, independent candidates for election to the Board at U.S. Steel\u2019s 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Our slate includes individuals with corporate governance experience, finance expertise, industrials and manufacturing backgrounds, public policy acumen and other qualifications critical to turning around a standalone U.S. Steel. The slate\u2019s plan includes installing Alan Kestenbaum, a steel industry legend who delivered total shareholder returns of more than 450% at Stelco Holdings Inc., as a replacement for Mr. Burritt. We expect the investment community will agree that any steel company would be fortunate to have Mr. Kestenbaum assume such a role. Our slate and Mr. Kestenbaum look forward to ultimately releasing their full plan for enhancing U.S. Steel\u2019s corporate governance, cost structure, labor relations, margins, operations and long-term viability as a force within the American economy. With the tailwind of President Trump\u2019s agenda, including steel tariffs, our nominees are confident they will shift the Company\u2019s strategy from hoping to be saved to implementing a multi-year plan that targets meaningful share price appreciation. The Case for Wholesale Change: The Board Has Doubled Down on its Bad Decision to Pursue a Risky Sale \u2013 Even After the Sale was Blocked by Executive Order We want to take this opportunity to share a few key facts. First and foremost, no transaction blocked by Presidential Executive Order after a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has ever gone through. This means there is no legal precedent for the litigation brought by U.S. Steel and Nippon earlier this month. Although U.S. Steel seems to be holding out hope that it can convince President Trump to approve the deal, the facts indicate that this is a pipe dream. President Trump has repeatedly voiced opposition to the transaction and has long been skeptical of deals with Japanese businesses. 1 In fact, just last month he stated \"I am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company, in this case Nippon Steel of Japan [\u2026] As President, I will block this deal from happening.\" 2 Nothing he has said since former President Joseph Biden\u2019s Executive Order indicates a change of heart. In addition to the aforementioned headwinds, the blocked deal also faced opposition from Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a bipartisan contingent of high-profile lawmakers and the United Steelworkers. When they were in the Senate, Messrs. Vance and Rubio previously co-authored a letter to then-Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen to stress that \"[t]he transaction was not entered into with U.S. national security in mind.\" 3 It should be clear as day that U.S. Steel is now fighting a binding Executive Order, the Trump administration, an array of senators and representatives, and a multitude of third parties that do not buy into Mr. Burritt\u2019s self-serving arguments. The Board should also be aware of what independent and objective legal experts have to say: \"Unfortunately for Nippon Steel, their argument is not particularly strong. The president's action in this case is explicitly excluded from judicial review under U.S. law.\" - Akira Inoue, partner, Baker & McKenzie 4 \"The D.C. Circuit is unlikely to overturn the blocking order based solely on allegations of pre-determination or the appearance of a sham process. Substantial evidence of constitutional violations or procedural defects is normally required. In addition, there does not appear to be a process for taking evidence, so the sham argument cannot be developed beyond what is in the public record.\" - Ken Nunnenkamp, partner, Morgan Lewis 5 \"Nippon and U.S. Steel face a formidable uphill battle in challenging CFIUS' referral and the president's exercise of authority to block the deal on national security grounds. Congress intended to shield CFIUS' decisions, and the president's conclusions under the CFIUS regime, from virtually all judicial review, an approach that is consistent with broad judicial deference to the executive branch on national security matters.\" - Mario Mancuso, George W. Hicks Jr. and Lucille Hague, partners, Kirkland & Ellis 6 It borders on delusional to think that the Trump administration would use precious political capital at the start of its term to reverse its public position on the transaction, not to mention undermine its clearly articulated focus on revitalizing American manufacturing and insourcing. The Case for Wholesale Change: The Board Has Allowed a Conflicted, Underperforming CEO to Hinder U.S. Steel\u2019s Credibility and Undermine the Company\u2019s Future Ancora has a proven track record of correctly identifying companies that are held back by conflicted or unfit CEOs. Before we seek the removal of a CEO, we typically try to work with a board of directors to address and course correct the executive\u2019s shortcomings. In this case, however, we see no future with Mr. Burritt. In our view, Mr. Burritt exhibited disqualifying behavior on January 3 rd , when he issued a statement that called former President Biden\u2019s decision \"shameful and corrupt . \" He continued what appeared to be a tirade by calling highly respected United Steelworkers President David McCall a \" union boss,\" effectively questioning his integrity. 7 We also need to scrutinize the Board\u2019s oversight of Mr. Burritt in light of his public accusation that the prior administration made a decision that supports the Chinese Communist Party. It runs counter to the interests of shareholders, to which Mr. Burritt owes a fiduciary duty, to make seemingly unhinged and retaliatory statements about plans \"to fight President Biden\u2019s political corruption.\" 8 Regardless of political leanings, this is not how standard public company executives act. Perhaps this is why Jeh Johnson, former Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, abruptly resigned from the Board in recent weeks. Since before the sale to Nippon was announced, Mr. Burritt also appears to have diverted his focus from U.S. Steel\u2019s operations. For example, on the conference call for the Nippon sale announcement, analysts noted that Big River\u2019s EBITDA per ton was down roughly 59% and the mini-mill cost per ton was up roughly 23% following the 2021 Big River acquisition. 9 Mr. Burritt\u2019s response to this was tone deaf: \"we feel absolutely wonderful about this Big River facility. And with Big River 2, it's going to be even more remarkable.\" 10 When U.S. Steel reported fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings only six weeks later, it revealed $12 million of costs related to Big River, which had the effect of reducing the mini-mill segment\u2019s EBITDA to just $74 million. 11 Unfortunately for shareholders, the trend of excess costs at Big River has continued unabated. On September 19, 2024, the Company disclosed that the mini-mill segment\u2019s adjusted EBITDA would be lower than the previous quarter, impacted by $40 million of costs from the Big River 2 mini-mill. 12 The Company followed this with a vague cautionary note on December 19, 2024, stating Big River 2 \"ramp-related costs exert pressure on the quarter.\" 13 In addition to unrelenting Big River cost overruns, U.S. Steel has consistently missed earnings estimates over the past year and a half while lagging its peers. Notably, during Mr. Burritt\u2019s tenure, the Company\u2019s total shareholder returns have underperformed peers by a staggering 227.7%. Total Shareholder Returns* 1-year 5-year Burritt CEO Tenure U.S. Steel -7.7% -21.3% 13.5% Peer Median 24.9% 180.6% 241.2% Relative Performance -32.2% -201.9% -227.7% Source: FactSet and Bloomberg. Peers include Commercial Metals Company, Cleveland-Cliffs Inc., Reliance, Inc., Steel Dynamics, Inc. and Nucor Corporation. *Total shareholder returns as of market close August 11, 2023, the last trading day prior to the Company\u2019s disclosure of initiating a strategic alternatives process. Mr. Burritt\u2019s election by the Board to assume the CEO role was announced May 10, 2017. Key Performance Metrics** Revenue Growth Adjusted EBITDA Growth CapEx Growth Free Cash Flow Growth U.S. Steel 19.7% -25.6% 336.6%*** -225.7% Peer Median 38.3% 15.5% 79.2% 55.0% Relative Performance -18.6% -41.1% 257.4% -280.7% **Key performance metrics measured from figures reported by U.S. Steel and peers from Q2 2021 to Q3 2024. These dates reflect the start of the economic recovery from COVID and the most recently reported quarter. ***CapEx Growth is based on incurred expenses and likely does not yet reflect U.S. Steel's $600 million budget expansion for Big River 2. U.S. Steel is now in a dire state due to its excessive capital spending, high debt, soft earnings and nonexistent contingency plan. While Mr. Burritt may not care due to what seem to be his jet-setting ways, we believe the city of Pittsburgh and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have been put at economic risk by his sale aspirations and mismanagement of the Company. There are consequences associated with having out-of-touch leadership with weak involvement in local communities. Absent a miracle, Ancora believes a substantial and urgent reconstitution of the Company\u2019s leadership is necessary. An Alternative Path Forward: Our Slate and Mr. Kestenbaum Want to Make U.S. Steel Great Again in the Public Market Ancora has nominated a fit-for-purpose slate with nine highly qualified individuals, whose complementary skills make them greater than the sum of their parts. Each is a leader in his or her respective field and is able to draw on prior public company experience to help set a viable go-forward strategy. Our nominees include individuals with experience in corporate governance, executive leadership, finance, logistics, manufacturing, regulatory affairs and strategic transactions. They come to the Board free of the incumbents\u2019 past mistakes, open-minded, and committed to producing enduring value for shareholders and stakeholders. Importantly, the slate includes industry heavyweight Alan Kestenbaum, the former Chairman and CEO of Stelco, as a CEO candidate for U.S. Steel. If our slate\u2019s campaign is successful, Mr. Kestenbaum will bring to the role a uniquely close relationship with the United Steelworkers, expertise in identifying and operating undervalued assets, and an unrelenting commitment to delivering the best possible results. Most notably, Mr. Kestenbaum has a history of turning U.S. Steel\u2019s failed endeavors into home runs. Look no further than what he accomplished at Stelco, a company U.S. Steel put into bankruptcy. Mr. Kestenbaum acquired Stelco for approximately $53 million, only to later sell it for more than $2 billion. 14 In the process, he enriched his shareholders through the success of a turnaround, whereas U.S. Steel\u2019s investors received virtually nothing for the asset. Considering the significant underperformance of U.S. Steel\u2019s operations and Mr. Burritt\u2019s underwhelming results as a leader, Mr. Kestenbaum represents a massive upgrade on all fronts. If elected, our slate and its CEO candidate are committed to the following: Pursuing the $565 million breakup fee that U.S. Steel needs based on Mr. Burritt\u2019s own statements regarding the prospect of potential facility closures and layoffs. Immediately ending the current Board\u2019s spending spree on Wall Street advisors, which we estimate to be a nine-figure sum over the past 18 months. Revamping the executive leadership team to be full of operators residing near facilities and plants. Restoring relations with labor union members and leaders, community organizations and elected officials. Releasing a clear standalone strategy so investors have transparency about priorities for capital allocation, operations and production, and other commercial initiatives. Protecting Mon Valley Works and other facilities Mr. Burritt has threatened to close. It\u2019s important to highlight that Mr. Kestenbaum\u2019s track record as a CEO includes increasing employment everywhere he has been. Not soliciting acquisition proposals from Cleveland-Cliffs, Inc. or any other partner (domestic or foreign). Please note that despite the sale to Nippon being blocked this month, you \u2013 the Board \u2013 decided to keep a January deadline for director candidate nominations in an apparent effort to insulate yourselves. We complied with your deadline despite being in the process of amassing a meaningful stake that will be disclosed in due course. Make no mistake, Ancora, as well as Mr. Kestenbaum, intend to build meaningful positions as sale pipe dreams fade and the Company\u2019s share price continues resetting from what have been artificially inflated levels. In closing, our goal here is straightforward: make U.S. Steel great again for the benefit of employees, customers, shareholders and all other stakeholders who want a bright future for this American icon. Only under a new Board and management team do we believe this is possible. Regards, Fredrick D.

Berkley This Earnings Season? Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 7:55 PM 4 min read In This Article: WRB +1.17% W.R. Berkley Corporation WRB is slated to report fourth-quarter 2024 earnings on Jan. 27, after market close. The insurer delivered an earnings surprise in each of the last four reported quarters. See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news. Factors to Consider Gross premiums written in the Insurance segment are likely to have benefited from well-performing other liability, short-tail lines and commercial auto. We expect the metric to be $3.3 billion, up 2.3% from the year-ago reported number. Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment\u2019s gross premiums written is expected to have improved, banking on well-performing monoline excess and property reinsurance. We expect the metric to be $349.8 million, up 5.8% from year ago reported number. . The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2024 premiums earned is pegged at $2.97 billion.\u00a0 Our estimate for the metric is pegged at $2.92 billion, indicating a 7.4% upside from the year-ago reported number. Improving cash flows and an increase in fixed-maturity income from a growing portfolio with higher yields are likely to have aided net investment income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2024 net investment income is pegged at $344 million. We estimate the metric to be $323.8 million, indicating an increase of 27.9% from the year-ago reported number. Improvement in premiums, coupled with higher investment income, is likely to have aided revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.5 billion, indicating an upside of 9.1% from the year-ago reported figure. Higher losses and loss expenses, expenses from non-insurance business, higher investment in technology and data and analytics as well as new startup operating unit expenses are likely to have increased expenses. We expect total expenses to increase 10.9% to $3 billion. Changes in reinsurance structures, as well as a change in business mix inducing increased compensation costs and start-up operating unit expenses, are likely to have contributed to the higher expense ratio. We estimate the metric to deteriorate 19 basis points in the to-be-reported quarter. Underwriting profitability is likely to have benefited from prudent pricing and increased exposure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the combined ratio as well as our estimate is pegged at 91. Continued share buybacks are likely to have provided additional support to the bottom line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at 94 cents, indicating a 3.1% decrease from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported number.

Kim Hjelmgaard, USA TODAY Updated Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 10:04 PM 5 min read Two Americans detained in Afghanistan were released in a prisoner exchange with the Taliban in the final hours of former President Joe Biden's time in office before President Donald Trump took over Monday. One of the Americans was Ryan Corbett, 42. He was arrested in Afghanistan in August 2022. The U.S. State Department had classified him as \"wrongfully detained.\" His family confirmed his release Tuesday in a statement , saying that Corbett was \"home after what has been the most challenging and uncertain 894 days of our lives.\" Taliban officials did not identify the second American freed, and there was no immediate public confirmation from that person's family or U.S. officials. However, a former senior Biden administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the family requested privacy, said it was William McKenty, 69. 'Sunshine': 3 Israeli hostages are free after 471 days in captivity. Here's who they are Corbett had lived in Afghanistan with his family until the U.S.-backed government fell to the Taliban in 2021 . He was abducted when he returned to that country a year later on a business trip connected to his micro-lending consultancy. Corbett's case had received some public attention. His wife, Anna, spoke on the phone with Biden and she also visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida. US citizen Ryan Corbett, who was detained in Afghanistan in 2022, is seen with his wife, Anna in this undated photo. Less is known about McKenty's case. Few details have emerged about his identity or what he was doing in Afghanistan when he was abducted. He has reportedly asked the U.S. government to help maintain his privacy. The deal was struck for Khan Mohammad , a member of the Taliban serving two life sentences in a U.S. prison. The U.S. Justice Department said Mohammad was convicted in 2008 on \"drug and narco-terrorism charges.\" The Taliban's foreign ministry said the deal was the done as a result of \"long and fruitful negotiations\" and was completed shortly before Trump was sworn in Monday. Mohammad was arrested about halfway through the U.S.'s 20-year war in Afghanistan, which it invaded to destroy al-Qaida and bring Osama bin Laden to justice. Staying could mean death: The escape nearly killed her. How one woman fled Afghanistan for freedom At a rally in Washington on the eve of his inauguration, Trump pledged to reclaim U.S. military equipment left behind in Afghanistan when the Biden administration pulled U.S. forces out of Kabul. Americans detained overseas At least two other American captives are being held in Afghanistan. One of them is George Glezmann, a former airline mechanic. The other one is Mahmood Habibi, a naturalized U.S. citizen, who was seized after a U.S. strike in Afghanistan in 2022 that killed al-Qaida's leader, Ayman al-Zawahri. Story Continues In their statement, the Corbett family praised both the Biden and Trump administrations for helping with the exchange. The family also expressed regret that Glezmann and Habibi were not part of it. They also thanked Qatar, an energy-rich Middle Eastern nation that has helped broker hostage exchanges between the U.S. and the Taliban over the years. A diplomat with knowledge of the exchange, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the details were not made public, said the negotiations lasted for two years. Once a deal was in place, Qatar provided logistical support to the Americans to ensure their safe exit from Afghanistan to the U.S. via Doha, the diplomat said. US military equipment in Afghanistan: What happened to it? Qatar has played a leading role alongside the U.S. and Egypt in mediating a hostage and prisoner exchange deal between Israel and Hamas. Three Israeli hostages were released from Gaza on Sunday, while 90 Palestinian prisoners were freed from Israeli prisons. More hostages and prisoners are set to be released on Jan. 25. The State Department designates Americans held overseas as \u201cwrongfully detained\u201d if it views their detentions as politically motivated and believes the charges are fabricated. That was the case with Evan Gershkovich , a Wall Street Journal reporter who was imprisoned in Russia for 16 months before his release last summer. 7 countries, secret meetings and a mom: Behind the deal that freed Evan Gershkovich The James W. Foley Legacy Foundation is named after an American journalist kidnapped and murdered by the Islamic State group in Syria in 2014. It reports that there are currently 36 publicly disclosed cases of Americans being held as hostages or wrongfully detained overseas. The majority are in the Middle East and Russia. The former senior Biden administration official said the deal with the Taliban was reached \"days\" before Biden left office but the trade was delayed until the day after Trump's inauguration because of logistical issues including poor weather. The official said that during the Biden administration 80 Americans were released around the world from Burma to Venezuela. The search in Syria for Austin Tice One American who is not waiting for the U.S. government to help find and secure her son's release is Debra Tice. She has not seen or heard from her son Austin since shortly after he went missing in Syria in 2012 after celebrating his 31st birthday. He was in Syria reporting on that country's civil war. Five weeks after he vanished, a shaky, 43-second video emerged titled \"Austin Tice is Alive.\" A Syrian dictator is toppled: new hopes raised for missing American journalist Austin Tice In it, the former captain in the U.S. Marines who was using his summer break from law school at Georgetown University to cover Syria's conflict is blindfolded and surrounded by armed men. The video shows Tice being led away by his apparent captors on a rocky hillside. In broken Arabic he recites portions of a prayer before stopping, clearly in distress, and saying \"Oh Jesus, Oh Jesus.\" From eye doctor to brutal dictator: The rise (and fall) of Syria's Bashar Assad The collapse of Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime late last year has renewed hopes \u2212 but brought few new clues \u2212 that one of the longest-held American hostages could soon be released, or failing that, his fate determined. \"I feel very strongly that Austin's here, and I think he knows I'm here,\" Debra Tice said of her son, now 42, in an interview with Reuters after arriving in Damascus on Saturday to step up the search for her son. \"I am hoping to get some answers.\" This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Prisoner swap with Taliban brings two Americans
