[{"text": "Land & Buildings Calls on Aimco to Immediately Pursue a Full Company Sale Process and Highlights Significant Upside to Current Share Price Business Wire Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 4:00 PM 3 min read Applauds CEO Wes Powell and Aimco Board for $520 Million Brickell Assemblage Transaction and Expanding Ongoing Strategic Review Believes That Following Brickell Transaction an Immediate Sale Process for the Remainder of the Portfolio \u2013 Principally Comprised of Highly Sought After Stabilized Multifamily Assets \u2013 Represents the Best Path Forward for Aimco Sees 30% Upside to Current Share Price Given Net Asset Value of $11.50/Share and Believes Whole Company Transaction Could Be Entered into by Mid-2025 STAMFORD, Conn., January 14, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Today, Land & Buildings Investment Management, LLC (together with its affiliates, \"Land & Buildings\" or \"L&B\"), a significant shareholder of Apartment Investment and Management Co. (NYSE: AIV) (\"Aimco\", \"AIV\", or the \"Company\"), issued the following statement commending Aimco management and its board of directors (the \"Board\") following the announcement of the Brickell Assemblage transaction and the expansion of the Company\u2019s strategic review process. L&B also is calling for a quick resolution to the Company\u2019s strategic review through a sale of the whole company, which L&B believes can unlock an additional 30% upside above the current share price. Jonathan Litt, Founder and Chief Investment Officer of Land & Buildings, stated: \"We applaud CEO Wes Powell, the rest of the Aimco management team and the Board on the announced sale of the Brickell Assemblage for $520 million. Following the closing of the sale of the Company\u2019s interests in 3333 Biscayne Boulevard and The Hamilton \u2013 also in Miami \u2013 for a gross price of $204 million, Aimco has executed an impressive volume of sales transactions to end 2024 at values in excess of our estimates. Since Land & Buildings\u2019 director nominee Jim Sullivan was elected to the AIV Board of Directors in December 2022, we have been pleased with the management team\u2019s strong operational execution, prudent capital allocation decisions and clear communication with investors. Following the announced sales of the non-core assets outlined above, the Company should immediately pursue a sale of the remaining portfolio. While the freshly announced expanded strategic review for the Company includes a full Company sale process as one of the options, the Board should recognize that this is not merely one path \u2013 it is the only one that makes sense given that Aimco remaining a going concern is not viable. It has been over two years since the Board first announced a \u2018review of a broad range of options to enhance stockholder value.\u2019 As Mr. Powell has said to investors and analysts in recent months, Aimco is subscale and not ideally suited for the public markets. With the south Florida asset sales in the rearview mirror, the stabilized, income-producing assets that are left now represent the vast majority of the value of Aimco. The Company has been streamlined and simplified, and M&A is fairly straightforward from here. Story Continues Aimco\u2019s portfolio is highly attractive to buyers given its favorable concentration in the Midwest and Northeast away from oversupply, assumable low-rate mortgage debt and substantial value-add component. Land & Buildings estimates the net asset value of the remaining portfolio (NAV) to be $11.50/share, or ~30% upside, largely consistent with estimates from Green Street, the leading independent public real estate research firm. We expect there to be a deep pool of potential acquirers for all or parts of the Company and that a transaction could be entered into by mid-2025.\" *** Disclaimer The views expressed are those of Land & Buildings as of the date referenced and are subject to change at any time based on market or other conditions.

VRAX ) to distribute Virax-branded Avian Influenza Virus Real-Time PCR Kits across various major European markets and certain Gulf Cooperation Council countries. Specifically, Cosmos Health gains exclusive rights to distribute these kits in Greece and Cyprus, as well as non-exclusive rights in select European countries, including France, Portugal, Spain, The Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria.

Kits in Greece and Cyprus, with Additional Rights in Select European and GCC Countries ACCESS Newswire \u00b7 Cosmos Health Inc. Cosmos Health Inc. Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 5:20 PM 5 min read In This Article: COSM +2.13% CHICAGO, IL / ACCESSWIRE / January 13, 2025 / Cosmos Health Inc. (\"Cosmos Health\" or the \"Company\") ( NASDAQ:COSM ), a diversified, vertically integrated global healthcare group engaged in innovative R&D, owner of proprietary pharmaceutical and nutraceutical brands, manufacturer and distributor of healthcare products, and operator of a telehealth platform, announced today that it has entered into a distribution agreement with Virax Biolabs Group Limited ( NASDAQ: VRAX ) (\"Virax\") to distribute Virax-branded Avian Influenza Virus (\"AIV\") Real-Time PCR Kits across various major European markets and certain Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Specifically, Cosmos Health gains exclusive rights to distribute these kits in Greece and Cyprus, as well as non-exclusive rights in select European countries, including France, Portugal, Spain, The Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. The agreement also grants non-exclusive distribution rights in certain Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, namely Oman and Bahrain. These specialized RT-PCR tests reliably detect ribonucleic acid (RNA) from AIV, including the H5, H7, and H9 subtypes, such as the globally concerning H5N1 strain. By enabling healthcare professionals to quickly identify infections, the kits play a crucial role in screening individuals exposed to infected livestock or high-risk environments, supporting effective public health responses. Under the agreement, Cosmos Health is authorized to import, sell, and distribute ViraxClear-branded kits within the agreed territories, while Virax will oversee regulatory compliance and provide the necessary documentation to support product registration and approval in these regions. Greg Siokas, CEO of Cosmos Health, stated : \"We are pleased to expand our collaboration with Virax and bring additional life-saving diagnostics to the forefront of healthcare. As avian influenza outbreaks continue to cause concern globally, our goal is to equip professionals, governments, and public health authorities with cutting-edge tools to detect and contain this potentially dangerous virus. Our partnership with Virax aligns with our dedication to delivering innovative healthcare solutions around the world.\" James Foster, CEO of Virax, commented : \"This agreement underscores our commitment to broadening the reach of our diagnostic platforms and ensuring that healthcare providers have timely access to next-generation testing capabilities. By leveraging Cosmos Health's established distribution network and expertise, we anticipate that these Avian Influenza Virus detection kits will reach key markets quickly, allowing for rapid response and intervention.\" Story Continues According to public health data, human infections with AIV have occurred in several regions, largely following exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. By supplying specialized Avian Influenza A Virus test kits that accurately differentiate among the various strains, Cosmos Health and Virax aim to enhance global preparedness, reduce the risk of transmission, and support healthcare systems in effectively monitoring and containing potential outbreaks.

\u00b7 skynesher via Getty Images Leslie Shaver Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 6:54 PM 2 min read In This Article: AIV -1.11% This story was originally published on Multifamily Dive . To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Multifamily Dive newsletter . Dive Brief: The board of directors for Aimco has decided to explore alternatives to \u201cunlock and maximize shareholder value\u201d for the Denver-based REIT, which could include a sale or merger of the company, according to a press release . Aimco\u2019s board also discussed the possibility of selling the major components of the business in one or a series of transactions and accelerating individual asset sales. The REIT is reducing its exposure to development activity and monetizing certain assets. In a move to simplify its holdings, Aimco agreed to sell its properties at 1001 Brickell Bay Drive and 1111 Brickell Bay Drive in Miami on Dec. 30 for a gross price of $520 million. Dive Insight: After closing the Brickell transactions, Aimco's portfolio sits at 5,200 units, an additional 1,000 newly constructed apartments that are expected to be stabilized within the next 12 months, an active development project on Miami's waterfront and a pipeline with more than 7.7 million square feet of developable sites. Aimco spun off from Denver-based Apartment Income REIT Corp. in December 2020. Since then, the REIT has generated a net operating income of more than 7.6%, completed more than $1.3 billion of development projects and closed more than $1.7 billion of asset sales, among other accomplishments. \u201cHowever, our shares continue to trade at a meaningful discount to our estimate of the private market value of our assets and investment platform, which we believe has limited our ability to fund new investment opportunities and accelerate growth, \" Aimco said in the press release. If Aimco were to be sold, it would follow the path taken by its larger sibling, AIR, last year. Last April, AIR and New York City-based investment manager Blackstone announced they had entered into an agreement where Blackstone Real Estate Partners X had acquired all outstanding common shares of AIR for approximately $10 billion, including the assumption of debt. Blackstone bought AIR for $39.12 per share, a 25% premium on its closing price on the New York Stock Exchange on April 5, 2024, the last trading day before the transaction\u2019s announcement. At the time, AIR owned 27,010 units across 76 rental housing communities, concentrated primarily in coastal markets including Miami, Los Angeles, Boston and Washington, D.C. Despite the price fetched by AIR, Aimco\u2019s board came short of committing to a sale. Story Continues \u201cThere can be no assurance that this expanded strategic process will result in any transaction or transactions or other strategic changes or outcomes, and the timing or outcome of any such event is similarly uncertain,\u201d the REIT said in the press release.

Agreement to Sell Brickell Properties PR Newswire Thu, Jan 9, 2025, 9:30 PM 5 min read In This Article: AIV -1.11% DENVER , Jan. 9, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- As previously announced on December 30, 2024 , Apartment Investment and Management Company (\"Aimco\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: AIV) entered into an agreement to sell the properties located at 1001 Brickell Bay Drive and 1111 Brickell Bay Drive in Miami, Florida (together referred to as the \"Brickell Assemblage\") for a gross price of $520 million . The buyer has completed due diligence and has made a non-refundable deposit of $38 million .\u00a0 Aimco intends to return the majority of the net proceeds from the transaction, after accounting for the associated property-level debt and deferred tax liability, to shareholders. Aimco (PRNewsfoto/Apartment Investment and Management Company (Aimco)) The pending sale of the Brickell Assemblage marks an important step in Aimco's efforts to simplify its holdings and to unlock value for shareholders.\u00a0 Upon closing of the Brickell Assemblage transaction, which is subject to certain closing conditions and extension options, Aimco will primarily consist of a portfolio of more than 5,200 well-located apartment homes that we believe is well-positioned to experience strong revenue growth, nearly 1,000 newly constructed apartment homes that are expected to be occupancy stabilized within the next 12 months, one active development project located on Miami's waterfront, and a deep pipeline for future growth that includes more than 7.7 million square feet of development potential. Since the spin-off of Apartment Income REIT Corp. in December of 2020, Aimco has delivered consistently strong operational performance with average annual same store NOI growth of greater than 7.6%, successfully completed more than $1.3 billion of development projects, secured attractively priced long-dated financing, significantly improved corporate governance, and pro forma for the Brickell sale, will have closed more than $1.7 billion of asset sales and returned substantial capital to shareholders, including the special dividend slated for January 31, 2025 , as previously announced. These results were achieved by a dedicated and experienced team that is active in its approach to investment and portfolio management and prudent in the allocation of shareholder capital. We are pleased with the transformation of the Aimco portfolio and the objective results delivered over the past four years. \u00a0However, our shares continue to trade at a meaningful discount to our estimate of the private market value of our assets and investment platform, which we believe has limited our ability to fund new investment opportunities and accelerate growth. Story Continues Therefore, the Aimco Board of Directors has decided to explore additional alternatives in an effort to further unlock and maximize shareholder value. The exploration will expand upon Aimco's ongoing efforts such as reducing exposure to development activity and monetizing certain assets, and include, but not be limited to, exploration of potential sales of the major components of the business (in one or a series of transactions), an acceleration of individual asset sales, or a sale or merger of the Company as a whole. \u00a0Our guiding principle will be to produce an outcome that delivers maximum value to Aimco shareholders.\u00a0 The strategic process is being overseen by Aimco's Investment Committee, comprised of four independent Aimco Board Members. Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC is serving as financial advisor to Aimco. There can be no assurance that this expanded strategic process will result in any transaction or transactions or other strategic changes or outcomes, and the timing or outcome of any such event is similarly uncertain. Aimco does not intend to disclose or comment on developments related to the foregoing unless or until it determines that further disclosure is appropriate or required.

Thu, Nov 21, 2024, 6:29 AM 8 min read In This Article: AIV-P.V 0.00% TORONTO, Nov. 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Apolo IV Acquisition Corp. (TSXV: AIV.P) (\u201c Apolo \u201d) and Marviken Ontario Inc. (\u201c Marviken \u201d) in cooperation with BotOptions (UK) PLC, a financial institution specialising in the issuing of debt instruments, are pleased to announce that, further to its news release dated October 22, 2024, it has entered into a definitive merger agreement dated November 19, 2024 (the \u201c Merger Agreement \u201d) with Marviken, Marviken ONE AB (\u201c Marviken Sweden \u201d) and Apolo IV Amalco Inc. (\u201c Apolo Subco \u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apolo, in connection with the proposed business combination of Apolo Subco and Marviken, which transaction (the \u201c Proposed Transaction \u201d) is intended to constitute Apolo\u2019s \u201cQualifying Transaction\u201d (within the meaning of Policy 2.4 \u2013 Capital Pool Companies of the TSX Venture Exchange (the \u201c Exchange \u201d)). The Proposed Transaction is structured such that Apolo Subco will amalgamate with Marviken (the \u201c Amalgamation \u201d) under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) (\u201c OBCA \u201d) to form a newly amalgamated company (\u201c Amalco \u201d). Pursuant to the Amalgamation, holders of common shares in the capital of Marviken (each a \u201c Marviken Share \u201d) will receive one common share in the capital of Apolo (each, an \u201c Apolo Share \u201d), in each case on a post-Consolidation (as defined below) basis. In addition, pursuant to the Amalgamation, each Marviken stock option and certain Marviken warrants will be exchanged for an Apolo stock option and/or Apolo warrant, as applicable, on substantially the same terms and conditions, except that such securities will thereafter be exercisable to receive common shares of the entity resulting from the Proposed Transaction (the \u201c Resulting Issuer \u201d). In order to align the value of the Apolo Shares with the value per Marviken Share at which the Proposed Transaction and the Concurrent Financing (as defined below) will be completed, Apolo will consolidate the Apolo Shares on the basis of one post-consolidation Apolo Share for every 4.1667 existing Apolo Shares as of the date of this news release (the \u201c Consolidation \u201d). Upon completion of the Proposed Transaction, the Resulting Issuer will carry on the business of Marviken and Marviken Sweden. Pursuant to the terms of the Proposed Transaction, Apolo intends to change its name to \u201cMarviken Energy Inc.\u201d or such other name as is mutually agreed between Apolo and Marviken and acceptable to applicable regulators (the \u201c Name Change \u201d). Further, it is proposed that the officers and directors of Marviken will replace the existing officers and directors of Apolo. Story Continues The Proposed Transaction is subject to a number of other conditions, including obtaining all necessary board, shareholder and regulatory approvals, including Exchange approval. The Merger Agreement The Merger Agreement contemplates that, among others, the following conditions precedent be met prior to the closing of the Proposed Transaction (the \u201c Effective Date \u201d), including, but not limited to, (a) acceptance by the Exchange and receipt of other applicable regulatory approvals; (b) completion of the Subscription Receipt Financing (as defined below); (c) receipt of the requisite approvals of the shareholders of Apolo (the \u201c Apolo Shareholders \u201d) with respect to the Apolo Consolidation, adoption of a new stock option plan (in such form as requested by Marviken, acting reasonably) (the \u201c Stock Option Plan \u201d), the director appointments agreed upon by Apolo and Marviken (the \u201c Director Appointments \u201d) and adoption of an advance notice by-law; (d) receipt of the requisite approvals of the shareholders of Marviken with respect to the Amalgamation; (e) no adverse material change in the business, affairs, financial condition or operations of Marviken or Apolo having occurred between the date of entering into the Merger Agreement and the closing date of the Proposed Transaction; and (f) dissent rights shall have been exercised in respect of no more than 5% of the issued and outstanding Marviken Shares. There can be no assurance that the Proposed Transaction will be completed as proposed or at all. The Amalgamation will not constitute a Non-Arm\u2019s Length Qualifying Transaction (as such term is defined in the policies of the Exchange). No person who or which is a Non-Arm\u2019s Length Party (as such term is defined in the policies of the Exchange) of Apolo has any direct or indirect beneficial interest in the share capital of Marviken or its assets prior to giving effect to the Amalgamation and no such person is an insider of Marviken. Similarly, there is no known relationship between or among any person who or which is a Non-Arm\u2019s Length Party of Apolo and any person who or which is a Non-Arm\u2019s Length Party to Marviken. If all conditions to the implementation of the Amalgamation have been satisfied or waived, Apolo and Marviken will carry out the Amalgamation. Pursuant to the terms of the Amalgamation, it is expected that the following security conversions, exercises and issuances will occur among Apolo, Marviken and the securityholders of Marviken at or prior to the Effective Date: the Apolo Shares being consolidated on the basis of one (1) post-Apolo Consolidation Apolo Share for every 4.1667 pre-Apolo Consolidation Apolo Shares; the Subscription Receipts being exchanged, without additional consideration or further action, into Marviken Consolidation Shares upon satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions; each broker warrant (as defined below) to be issued to the Agents (as defined below) in connection with the Concurrent Financing outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date shall be exchanged for Resulting Issuer Share purchase warrants (the \u201c Resulting Issuer Broker Warrants \u201d) such that the holders of such Resulting Issuer Broker Warrants will be entitled to the purchase of one Resulting Issuer Share per one Resulting Issuer Broker Warrant; Apolo will acquire all of the issued and outstanding Marviken Shares such that all issued and outstanding Marviken Shares, including those issued in exchange for the Subscription Receipts, will be exchanged, without additional consideration or further action, for Resulting Issuer Shares on the basis of one (1) Marviken Share for one (1) Resulting Issuer Share; each stock option of Marviken and each warrant of Marviken outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date, whether vested or not vested, shall be cancelled and exchanged for comparable securities of the Resulting Issuer (\u201c Resulting Issuer Options \u201d and \u201c Resulting Issuer Warrants \u201d) on economically equivalent terms, subject to adjustments contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and each stock option of Apolo outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date, whether vested or not vested, shall be cancelled and exchanged for Resulting Issuer Options on economically equivalent terms, subject to adjustments contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Capitalization As at the date of this news release and prior to the Consolidation, Apolo has 20,000,000 common shares and 2,750,000 stock options, each exercisable to acquire one Apolo Share (on a pre-Consolidation basis), issued and outstanding. As at the date hereof, Marviken has 50,000,000 common shares issued or issuable under existing agreements. On completion of the Proposed Transaction, assuming the completion of a $5,000,000 subscription receipt private placement financing by Marviken (the \u201c Concurrent Financing \u201d) through a syndicate of agents led by Haywood Securities Inc. (the \u201c Agents \u201d) as further described in Apolo\u2019s news release dated October 22, 2024, and assuming completion of the Consolidation, it is anticipated that there will be an aggregate of approximately 64,800,000 Apolo Shares outstanding, of which 7.4% shall be held by the former Apolo shareholders, and the remainder by the Marviken shareholders, including subscribers under the Concurrent Financing. The foregoing excludes any Apolo shares issuable under any convertible instruments (including under any Resulting Issuer Options, Resulting Issuer Options or Resulting Issuer Broker Warrants). Sponsorship The Proposed Transaction is subject to the sponsorship requirements of the Exchange, unless a waiver or exemption from this requirement can be obtained in accordance with the policies of the Exchange. In connection with the Concurrent Financing, Apolo intends to apply for a waiver of the sponsorship requirement; however, there is no assurance that a waiver from this requirement can or will be obtained. Trading in Apolo Shares Trading in the Apolo Shares will remain halted pending the review of the Proposed Transaction by the Exchange and satisfaction of the conditions of the Exchange for resumption of trading. It is likely that trading in the Apolo Shares will not resume prior to the closing of the Proposed Transaction.

Aimco (PRNewsfoto/Apartment Investment and Management Company (Aimco)) Financial Results and Highlights Aimco's net loss attributable to common stockholders per share, on a fully dilutive basis, was $(0.16) for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , as higher net contributions from multifamily property operations were offset by increases in interest expense and depreciation related to advancing and completing development projects. Third quarter 2024 revenue, expenses, and net operating income (\"NOI\") from Aimco's Stabilized Operating Properties increased 4.1%, 10.6%, and 1.6%, respectively, year-over-year, with average monthly revenue per apartment home increasing by 2.4% to $2,415 and average daily occupancy increasing by 160 basis points to 96.8%. During the third quarter, Aimco substantially completed construction at its Strathmore Square project located in Bethesda, Maryland and began construction on an ultra-luxury residential tower located at 640 NE 34th Street (\"34 th Street\") in the Edgewater neighborhood of Miami, Florida . Total direct project costs for the 34 th Street development are expected to be $240 million with initial occupancy scheduled in mid-2027 and NOI yields are projected to exceed 7% on direct costs at stabilization. In October, Aimco announced agreements to sell, for a total price at Aimco's share of $203.8 million , its interests in two investments in Miami, Florida , The Hamilton , a recently completed redevelopment of a 276-unit apartment building, and a 2.8-acre development site at 3333 Biscayne Boulevard. As of October 31, 2024 , Aimco had acquired 4.5 million shares of its common stock during the year, at an average cost of $7.98 per share. CEO Commentary Wes Powell , Aimco President and Chief Executive Officer, comments: \"Aimco continues its efforts to add value through effective management of the Aimco portfolio and thoughtful capital allocation. \"Continued consumer strength, and limited competitive new supply, across the majority of Aimco's markets have led to revenue per home reaching more than $2,400 per month, increasing by 2.4% year-over-year, while at the same time average daily occupancy reached 96.8%, an increase of 160 basis points, year-over-year. For the full year, we now expect revenue to grow between 3.75% and 4.25% with NOI growth of between 2.50% to 3.75%, an increase of more than 200 basis points at the mid-point when compared to our initial expectations. Story Continues \"During the third quarter, Aimco began construction on a waterfront development project in Miami's Edgewater neighborhood. Upon completion, 34 th Street will be Miami's premier ultra-luxury rental apartment building fronting Biscayne Bay. The 38-story tower will contain 114 highly-appointed apartment homes, each with unobstructed water views and averaging over 2,500 square feet in size. The project will also contain highly tailored amenity offerings plus 7,000 square feet of waterfront restaurant space. We are pleased to be partnering with a leading global investment firm on this exciting project, such that Aimco's equity commitment has been fully funded through the contribution of our land and pre-development efforts along with an incremental $5 million . \"Aimco's additional projects in active development and lease-up are progressing on plan and are expected to be fully delivered by year end, with occupancy stabilization projected to occur during 2025. We now expect direct costs at Upton Place and Strathmore Square to be $6 million less than our prior estimate. Together these two projects contain more than 900 apartment homes and will add considerable value to the Aimco portfolio as they complete lease-up and stabilize over the next 12-24 months. \"Aimco continues its focus on prudently allocating capital, which includes taking advantage of the disconnect between public and private valuations when those opportunities arise. \"In October, we announced agreements to sell our recently completed redevelopment, The Hamilton , along with our interest in a nearby development site at 3333 Biscayne Boulevard for more than $200 million . Upon closing these sales will crystallize accretive investments and provide Aimco with approximately $90 million , after associated liabilities are retired, to return to stockholders during the first quarter of 2025. \"Additionally,\u00a0we are advancing efforts related to the sale of our two-property assemblage in Miami's Brickell neighborhood and remain committed to unlocking the value embedded within those exceptional assets. \"We continue to believe that Aimco shares represent an accretive use of excess capital and, as of October 31, 2024 , had repurchased 4.5 million shares year-to-date bringing total repurchases since the start of 2022 to 14.1 million shares at an average cost per share of $7.51 . \"I thank the Aimco team for their continued dedication and the Aimco Board of Directors who remain steadfast in their commitment to creating and unlocking value for Aimco stockholders.\" Operating Property Results Aimco owns a diversified portfolio of operating apartment communities located in eight major U.S. markets with average rents in line with local market averages. Results at Aimco's Stabilized Operating Properties were as follows: Third Quarter Year-to-Date Stabilized Operating Properties Year-over-Year Sequential Year-over-Year ($ in millions) 2024 2023 Variance 2Q 2024 Variance 2024 2023 Variance Average Daily Occupancy 96.8\u00a0% 95.2\u00a0% 1.6\u00a0% 96.3\u00a0% 0.5\u00a0% 97.0\u00a0% 96.5\u00a0% 0.5\u00a0% Revenue, before utility reimbursements $39.3 $37.7 4.1\u00a0% $38.7 1.5\u00a0% $116.6 $111.4 4.7\u00a0% Expenses, net of utility reimbursements 11.9 10.7 10.6\u00a0% 12.2 (2.2)\u00a0% 35.5 33.4 6.3\u00a0% Net operating income (NOI) 27.4 27.0 1.6\u00a0% 26.5 3.2\u00a0% 81.1 78.0 4.0\u00a0% Revenue in the third quarter 2024 was $39.3 million , up 4.1% year-over-year, resulting from a 2.4% increase in average monthly revenue per apartment home to $2,415 and a 160-basis point increase in Average Daily Occupancy to 96.8%. Compared to the second quarter 2024, revenue was up 1.5% with a 1.0% increase in average monthly revenue per apartment home and a 50-basis point increase in Average Daily Occupancy. Effective rents on all leases during the third quarter 2024 were 3.9% higher, on average, than the previous lease and 59.9% of residents whose leases were expiring signed renewals. Year to date, as of October 31, 2024 , effective rents on all transacted leases were 3.7% higher, on average, than the previous lease. The median annual household income of new residents was $137,000 in the third quarter 2024, representing a rent-to-income ratio of 19.3%, a decline of 70 basis points from the second quarter 2024. Expenses in the third quarter 2024 were up 10.6% year-over-year but down 2.2% compared to the second quarter 2024, primarily due to fluctuations in real estate taxes driven by increases in 2024, adjustments to estimated taxes, and the impact of favorable real estate tax appeals and valuations received during the third quarter 2023. NOI in the third quarter 2024 was $27.4 million , up 1.6% year-over-year and 3.2% over the second quarter 2024. Year-to-date, NOI was $81.1 million an increase of 4.0% over the first nine months of 2023. Value Add and Opportunistic Investments Development and Redevelopment Aimco generally seeks development and redevelopment opportunities where barriers to entry are high, target customers can be clearly defined, and Aimco has a comparative advantage over others in the market. Aimco's value add and opportunistic investments may also target portfolio acquisitions, operational turnarounds, and re-entitlements. As of September 30, 2024 , Aimco had two multifamily development projects under construction and two multifamily communities that have been substantially completed and are now in lease-up. These projects remain on track, as measured by construction budget and lease-up metrics. In addition to Aimco's core multifamily developments, The Benson Hotel and Faculty Club was completed in 2023 and remains in stabilization. Aimco also has a pipeline of future value add opportunities in Aimco's target markets of Southeast Florida , the Washington D.C. Metro, and Colorado's Front Range. During the third quarter, $29.6 million of capital was invested in Aimco's development and redevelopment activities, primarily funded through construction loan draws. Updates on active development projects and Aimco's pipeline include: In the third quarter, construction began in Miami's Edgewater neighborhood on 34 th Street, an ultra- luxury waterfront residential tower that will include a highly tailored amenity package and approximately 7,000 square feet of ground floor retail space. The rental homes will average more than 2,500 square feet, feature 9 \u2013 10 foot ceilings, oversized private terraces, top-of-the-line finishes, and unobstructed views of Biscayne Bay. Aimco expects to welcome the first residents at this $240 million project in 3Q 2027 and stabilize occupancy in 4Q 2028. In Upper Northwest Washington D.C., construction at Upton Place is substantially complete with all 689 apartment homes delivered. As of October 31, 2024 , Aimco had leased or pre-leased 296 units and 268 homes were occupied, at rates ahead of our initial projections. Additionally, as of October 31, 2024 , approximately 90% of the project's 105K square feet of retail space had been leased with tenant fit-out ongoing. We now expect total direct project costs to be $2 million less than our previous estimate. In Bethesda, Maryland , construction was substantially completed at the first phase of Strathmore Square during the third quarter, with all 220 of the highly tailored apartment homes delivered. As of October 31, 2024 , Aimco had leased 68 units at rates ahead of our initial projections, and 58 homes were occupied. We now expect total direct project costs to be $4 million less than our previous estimate. In Corte Madera, California , construction is ongoing at Oak Shore where 16 luxury single-family rental homes and eight accessory dwelling units are being developed. As of October 31, 2024 , 19 of the residences had been delivered with the remaining scheduled for completion by year end. Of the 19 homes delivered to date, 12 were occupied and Aimco has pre-leased another three at rates ahead of our initial projections. In the third quarter 2024, Aimco invested $0.4 million into programming, design, documentation, and entitlement efforts related to select pipeline projects primarily located in South Florida and on the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Colorado . Consistent with Aimco's capital allocation strategy, it may choose to monetize certain of these assets prior to vertical construction in an effort to maximize value add and risk-adjusted returns. Investment & Disposition Activity Aimco is focused on prudently allocating capital and delivering strong investment returns. Consistent with Aimco's capital allocation philosophy, it monetizes the value within its assets when accretive uses of the proceeds are identified and invests when the risk-adjusted returns are superior to other uses of capital. Subsequent to quarter end, Aimco agreed to sell, for $203.8 million , its interests in two real estate investments in the Edgewater neighborhood of Miami , Florida.\u00a0The all-cash transactions, described below, are expected to close by year-end 2024. Upon closing, Aimco plans to retire $110.1 million of associated liabilities, currently carrying an average rate of 8.6%, and expects to return approximately $90 million of capital to stockholders during the first quarter of 2025. The Hamilton,\u00a0Aimco's recently completed major redevelopment is under contract for $190.0 million and the buyer's deposit is non-refundable. Aimco's interest in 3333 Biscayne Boulevard, a 2.8-acre development site, is under agreement to be purchased by Aimco's joint venture partner at a gross valuation of $66.5 million or $13.8 million at Aimco's share of the venture. Aimco continues to advance the sales process related to its Brickell Assemblage, which includes 1001 and 1111 Brickell Bay Drive in Miami, Florida . Aimco does not intend to comment or provide further information until a definitive agreement has been executed and buyer deposits have become nonrefundable. Balance Sheet and Financing Activity Aimco is highly focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, including ample liquidity. As of September 30, 2024 , Aimco had access to $260.4 million , including $82.6 million of cash on hand, $27.8 million of restricted cash, and the capacity to borrow up to $150.0 million on its revolving credit facility. Aimco's net leverage as of September 30, 2024 , was as follows: as of September 30, 2024 Aimco Share, $ in thousands Amount Weighted\u00a0Avg. Maturity (Yrs.) [1] Total non-recourse fixed rate debt $ 773,474 6.5 Total non-recourse floating rate debt 90,660 1.0 Total non-recourse construction loan debt 372,947 1.3 Cash and restricted cash (109,884) Net Leverage $ 1,127,197 [1] Weighted average maturities presented exclude contractual extension rights. In the third quarter, Aimco secured commitments for $56 million of preferred equity and a $172 million construction loan for the financing of its 34 th Street development in Miami, Florida . As of October 31, 2024 , Aimco had fully funded its equity requirements to the venture, primarily through the contribution of land and predevelopment improvements. As of September 30, 2024 , 100% of Aimco's total debt was either fixed rate or hedged with interest rate cap protection. Considering investments under contract to sell and including contractual extensions, Aimco has no debt maturing prior to May 2026 .

In the third quarter, 33,496 units of the Aimco Operating Partnership's equity securities were redeemed in exchange for cash at a weighted average price per unit of $8.50 . Year to date, 84,797 units were redeemed in exchange for cash at a weighted average price per unit of $8.09 . Commitment to Enhance Stockholder Value The Aimco Board of Directors, in coordination with management, remains intently focused on maximizing and unlocking value for Aimco stockholders and continues to engage regularly with several leading advisory firms, including Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC. Aimco's announced plans to reduce exposure to development activity and monetize certain assets represent a commitment to simplify the portfolio and unlock embedded value when there are opportunities to do so. These efforts will further improve Aimco's positioning in the market and provide increased flexibility as the Board of Directors continues its review and consideration of broader strategic actions to maximize stockholder value. In addition, in conjunction with our contemplated asset sales, we will prioritize return of capital to our stockholders as a key component of our capital allocation philosophy. There can be no assurance that the ongoing review will result in any particular transaction or transactions or other strategic changes or outcomes and the timing of any such event is similarly uncertain. The Company does not intend to disclose or comment on developments related to the foregoing unless or until it determines that further disclosure is appropriate or required. 2 024 Outlook 3Q 2024 2024 2024 $ in millions (except per share amounts), Square Feet in millions Forecast is full year unless otherwise noted YTD Results Forecast Prior Forecast Net income (loss) per share \u2013 diluted [1] $(0.67) $(0.82) - $(0.77) $(0.80) - $(0.75) Operating Properties Revenue Growth, before utility reimbursements 4.7\u00a0% 3.75% - 4.25% 3.25% - 3.75% Operating Expense Growth, net of utility reimbursements 6.3\u00a0% 5.50% - 6.50% 6.00% - 7.50% Net Operating Income Growth 4.0\u00a0% 2.50% - 3.75% 1.50% - 2.75% Recurring Capital Expenditures $11 ~$13 $11 - $13 Active Developments and Redevelopments Total Direct Costs of Projects in Occupancy Stabilization at Period End [2] $589 $642 $648 Total Direct Costs of Projects Under Construction at Period End [2] $293 $240 $0 - $250 Direct Project Costs $75.9 $100 - $105 $70 - $100 Other Capitalized Costs $14.9 $18 - $20 $18 - $20 Construction Loan Draws [3] $101.1 $113 - $123 $88 - $90 JV Partner Equity Funding $1.2 $5 - $7 $0 - $25 AIV Equity Funding [4] ~$5 $0 - $5 Pipeline Projects Pipeline Size Gross Square Feet at Period End [5] 12.7 7.7 - 12.7 9.5 - 13.3 Pipeline Size Multifamily Units at Period End [5] 5,858 3,708 - 5,858 4,358 - 5,972 Pipeline Size Commercial Sq Ft at Period End [5] 1.7 1.0 - 1.7 1.2 - 1.7 Planning Costs $3.2 ~$4 $5 - $10 Real Estate Transactions Acquisitions None None None Dispositions [6] None See Below See Below General and Administrative $23.9 $33 - $34 $33 - $35 Leverage Interest Expense, net of capitalization [7] $39.0 $56 - $58 $56 - $58 [1] Net income (loss) per share - diluted does not include any gains associated with potential transactions in 2024.

to Launch Customized Small Language Model Solutions for Privacy-Critical Enterprise Applications Business Wire Wed, Dec 11, 2024, 12:30 AM 3 min read (Graphic: Business Wire) CUPERTINO, Calif., December 10, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Aizip, Inc. in partnership with SoftBank Corp., announced the release of customized Small Language Model (SLM) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) solutions for enterprise applications. The system operates locally on mobile devices or on-premises servers, addressing the pressing concerns of enterprise data safety. Fine-tuned with domain specific data, these SLMs can address unique enterprise tasks with comparable accuracy to 100x larger cloud LLMs. This announcement comes as many companies have implemented bans on cloud-based LLMs for business-related tasks, citing concerns about leaks of private information. A recent survey from Menlo Ventures found that 21% of failed AI pilots were due to data-privacy hurdles. Fine-tuned SLMs are an alternative to general LLMs, offering security and privacy of information along with the benefits of AI-enabled work. Many enterprises have explored using open-source Small Language Models that run locally and efficiently on-premises as replacements for cloud-based LLMs. However, these models have generally turned out to be too unreliable to meet production-level performance requirements. Aizip and SoftBank address this challenge with innovative new solutions. The joint team developed and delivered a customized SLM integrated into a RAG system, running locally as a mobile application. When applied to SoftBank\u2019s internal documents the application offers employees a Q&A platform that generates accurate, up-to-date response, running entirely on an iPhone 14. Testing shows that the system satisfactorily addresses 97% of employee questions, and response quality measured on a dataset of 22,000 questions matched responses generated by a GPT-4o-based RAG system. The key to this unique reliability is Aizip\u2019s SLM-customization pipeline, which includes high-quality data generation, fine-tuning, and multifaceted evaluation. \"While there are an increasing number of open-source SLMs available today, off-the-shelf models often fall short of the production accuracy required for enterprise tasks,\" noted Aizip SLM-development lead Weier Wan. Aizip\u2019s SLM-customization pipeline is run iteratively until target accuracy is achieved, so enterprises no longer need to choose between privacy and performance. Although the first product was developed for the iPhone, Aizip\u2019s flexible SLM-deployment tools allow SLMs and RAG systems to run on a variety of edge platforms, including on-premises servers, PCs, and even IoT devices like microprocessors (MPUs), as announced in June 2024. Story Continues Looking ahead, the joint team aims to leverage SoftBank\u2019s rich expertise in enterprise services and Aizip\u2019s cutting-edge AI technology to expand customized SLM solutions to a broader range of applications and customers. \"Privacy-critical and offline-required use cases can benefit greatly from Aizip\u2019s on-device AI technology,\" described SoftBank vice president Katsuya Kitazawa, head of the Information Technology & Architect Division. \"Whether assisting flight attendants on airplanes or supporting field workers in remote locations, we\u2019re excited to collaborate with Aizip to bring this innovation to more users and businesses.\" Aizip remains committed to delivering production-grade AI solutions for a variety of on-device applications. With extensive experience in developing robust and efficient AI models across Aizip Intelligent Audio (AIA), Vision (AIV), and Time-Series (AIT) product lines, Aizip continues to pioneer SLM technology, focused on improved accuracy, reliability, speed, and development efficiency.
