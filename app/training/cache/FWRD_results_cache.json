This compares to year-ago revenues of $268.22 million. The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Marten Transport shares have added about 2.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 3.7%. What's Next for Marten Transport? While Marten Transport has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Marten Transport: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

flexing \u2014 with a new category. Launching Jan. 30, Staud Sport is a fashion twist on everyday sportswear that aims to rise above typical athleisure. More from WWD Alix Earle Is Bringing Back Skinny Jeans with a New Campaign and Collaboration for Frame Grammys With a New Tone: How L.A. Fires Are Shaping Style and Sentiment Jhen\u00e9 Aiko's Wellness Brand Jhenetics Provides Stress Relief to Frontline Workers Battling Wildfires Designed for workouts and beyond, Staudinger created the collection to go from the gym to errands to out-to-dinners, while being comfy and chic. And it\u2019s a natural progression from her previous forays into the market through collaborations with New Balance and Keds, and her own limited-edition pickleball capsule collection, spurred by her personal love of the sport. The collection had been at the back of her mind for a number of years now, Staudinger told WWD via email. \u201cThe gap in the female-facing athleisure market inspired us\u00a0to create something different: pieces that are accessible, adaptable, and effortlessly integrated into an everyday wardrobe, making dressing for movement feel intuitive rather than redundant,\u201d she said of Staud Sport, which will release two seasonal collections this year, before increasing to four. Staud Sport \u201cRight now, the market is flooded with activewear that prioritizes competition, stats, and run clubs \u2014 an approach that doesn\u2019t resonate with our customers.\u00a0Our customers are looking for chic, functional pieces that seamlessly transition into their daily lives. Staud Sport fits right into that \u2014 it\u2019s about creating a collection that\u2019s active, but with a sophisticated, everyday twist,\u201d she said, emphasizing that it\u2019s for the in-between moments in life. \u201cFor our customer: hydrating is sport, WFH is sport, motherhood is sport and we want them to look good in every capacity.\u201d The versatile pieces eschew heavy logos, but are crafted with performance fabrics and capabilities, and can be layered with pieces from the mainline collection. Standouts include short anoraks with sleeves that can be zipped on and off; oversize hair scrunchies that can double as mini bags to stow essentials like keys and jewelry; packable neoprene sneaker ballet flats and a full length, full-skirted performance gown. Staud Sport Staudinger has been reaching for the Alba sport ballet shoe herself. \u201cAs part of our campaign, we styled it both bare-legged with a Crevasse minidress as well as with tube socks and our Pulse leggings. The Sport Harlow bag has been updated in technical nylon and still carries our signature moon buckle perfectly blending our design codes,\u201d she said. Story Continues There are also plenty of second-skin layers in ivory, chocolate brown or black with asymmetric zipper details, including a flirty short dresses, cropped T-shirts, bralettes and Capri leggings, technical nylon miniskirts and wide-leg pants. The collection, $75 to $395, will be available Jan. 30 on the Staud website and in Staud stores. Founded in 2015 by Staudinger and artistic director George Augusto on the idea of accessible California luxury with a European twist, the Staud main line ranges in price from $149 to $1,295. The brand has six permanent physical stores, two seasonal stores, and wholesale partners including Shopbop, Fwrd and all the major department stores. The largest minority investor is Chris Burch, of Burch Creative Capital. Staud Sport The brand\u2019s chief executive officer and creative director, Staudinger was last in the headlines in December when she was revealed to be the buyer of Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy\u2019s collection at Sotheby\u2019s. Like many in L.A., she\u2019s been deeply affected by the wildfires that continue to rage this month. \u201cI grew up in the Palisades, and my mom was still living there during the fires, unfortunately losing her home. It\u2019s completely heartbreaking to not only lose the entire neighborhood physically,\u00a0but also emotional landmarks like memories from a series of all your first memories,\u201d she said. \u201cSeeing how we\u2019ve all come together over the last weeks renewed my faith in the Los Angeles community with so many individuals and brands rallying to provide both immediate relief and long-term support,\u201d she continued, adding that her brand has focused monetary donations on the local fire departments, community groups, and organizations supporting animal welfare, food, and clothing assistance. In the coming months, Staud will be launching special pieces that will directly benefit the Labelle Foundation, LAFD, and other initiatives aimed at supporting the recovery of the city.

Ranging from hoodies and fleece pants to balaclavas, gloves, Ts, and jerseys, the collection \u2014 showcased in a campaign by visual artist Jacolby Satterwhite \u2014 was also inspired by the logo of the Irvine, Calif.-based Fox Racing extreme sports lifestyle brand. \u201cThe re-interpretation of the \u2018fox head\u2019 graphic is explored in a classic manner by inserting, shaping and cutting onto supple jersey pieces forming comfortable staples \u2014 a long-sleeve jersey top, sweat shirt and trousers,\u201d the designer shared. \u201cA variation of the balaclava features in a light jersey and a fur-lined alternative.\u201d The capsule collection, which kicks off the first of more Fox Labs collaborations to come, launches Jan. 16 in Kiko Kostadinov\u2019s L.A. and Tokyo stores as well as online; Jan. 18 at Fox Racing and Dover Street Market in stores and online; and Jan. 22 at global stockists such as Nordstrom, SSense, GR8, Fwrd, Atelier New York, Addicted Seoul, and more. \u201cFor 50 years, Fox has defined the look and culture of racing,\u201d Chad Hilton, Fox Racing brand director, said in a statement. \u201cWhat started as a jersey promoting aftermarket race parts has become a look and a logo synonymous with innovation, influence and winning.

Transformation Strategy, Reducing Annual Operational Expenditures by Approximately $20 Million Reaffirms Full Year 2024 Consolidated EBITDA Guidance of $300 Million to $310 Million GREENEVILLE, Tenn., January 06, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Forward Air Corporation (NASDAQ:FWRD) (the \"Company\" or \"Forward\") today announced that its Board of Directors has initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. The Board will consider a range of options, including a potential sale, merger or other strategic or financial transaction relative to the long-term value potential of the Company on a standalone basis. George Mayes, Independent Chairman of the Board of Directors, said, \"Under Forward Air\u2019s new leadership team, the Company is making tangible progress executing the Omni integration and delivering on synergy targets ahead of schedule, while stabilizing the business and advancing the early stages of transforming the Company to become a global logistics powerhouse through the implementation of its strategic plan. While this work is underway, the Board and management team have been actively analyzing the business and strategy to ensure the Company pursues the best path forward to enhance shareholder value. To be comprehensive in its assessment of value creation opportunities, the Board has initiated this exploration of strategic alternatives and is committed to pursuing a path that will maximize shareholder value. Regardless of the outcome of this review, Forward will not waver in its commitment to our customers to deliver consistent high-quality service.\" The Board has not set a timetable for the conclusion of this review, nor has it made any decisions related to any further actions or potential strategic alternatives at this time. There can be no assurance that any transaction or other strategic outcome will be approved by the Board or otherwise consummated. The Company does not intend to disclose developments relating to this process until it determines that further disclosure is appropriate or necessary. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC is serving as financial advisor, and Jones Day is serving as legal counsel. Amendment to the Senior Secured Term Loan (the \"Credit Agreement\") The Company has amended its Credit Agreement which includes the following changes: Modified the maximum consolidated first lien net leverage ratio to the levels and for the corresponding quarters set forth in the table below.

We sincerely appreciate the support of our lenders and look forward to capitalizing on the tremendous opportunity we have ahead of us.\" Additional details regarding the amendment can be found in the Company\u2019s Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC. Transformation Initiatives Underway Shawn Stewart, Chief Executive Officer, said, \"During the fourth quarter, we implemented the initial phase of our broader transformation strategy to create a truly integrated and go-to solution provider, and I am very pleased with the pace and rigor we are seeing in the early days. Our initial actions have primarily been focused on structural changes which streamline operations and better support our long-term growth initiatives. Growing our business, operating more efficiently and rightsizing our cost structure will allow us to better serve our customers, take advantage of anticipated demand when the market normalizes and capture the potential of the combined legacy companies.\" As part of the transformation, in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company took additional steps to reduce operating expenses, including a reduction in workforce, consolidating terminal operations and reducing the use of third-party vendors. These efficiencies are expected to result in approximately $20 million in savings on an annualized basis. These savings are incremental to the $75 million in synergies from the merger integration, which are on track to be achieved by the end of the first quarter of 2025. Reaffirms Full Year 2024 Consolidated EBITDA Guidance As previously announced, Forward expects full year 2024 Consolidated EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure pursuant to the Credit Agreement, to be in the range of $300 million to $310 million. This range includes the fourth quarter 2024 reduction in operating expenses of approximately $20 million.

Forward Air Corporation Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this press release, the Company includes financial measures that are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), including Consolidated EBITDA calculated in accordance with our credit agreement (\"Consolidated EBITDA\") for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. The Company believes that meaningful analysis of its financial performance requires an understanding of the factors underlying that performance, including an understanding of items that are non-operational. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions as well as evaluating the Company\u2019s performance. All non-GAAP financial measures are presented on a continuing operations basis. The Company believes Consolidated EBITDA provides investors with important information regarding our financial condition and compliance with our obligations under our credit agreement. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to or substitute for, the Company\u2019s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company has included, for the periods indicated, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Investors and other readers are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures set forth below. With respect to the preliminary 2024 Consolidated EBITDA, please note that the Company is not providing a quantitative reconciliation because it is not available without unreasonable efforts. The Company does not currently have sufficient data to accurately estimate the variables and individual adjustments for such reconciliation, or to quantify the probable significance of these items. The adjustments required for any such reconciliation of the Company\u2019s forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures cannot be accurately forecast by the Company, and therefore the reconciliation has been omitted.

PM 4 min read In This Article: FWRD -4.65% The Forward Air board of directors has initiated a review of strategic alternatives for the logistics\u00a0company, including a potential sale, following calls last year from multiple activist investors to consider discussions with prospective buyers. The board is also considering a possible merger \u201cor other strategic or financial transaction,\u201d but has not made any further decisions, according to a company statement Monday morning. No timetable has been set for the review\u2019s conclusion. More from Sourcing Journal President Jimmy Carter's Trade and Logistics Legacy This Is Why Vera Bradley Is the Latest Activist Target Cart.com President Talks Peak Season, De Minimis and Billion-Dollar Ambitions Four activist investors that represent roughly 25 percent of Forward Air\u2019s outstanding shares have publicly called on the company to explore strategic alternatives in the wake of its widely panned $2.1 billion acquisition of Omni Logistics, which saddled the less-than-truckload (LTL) and intermodal services provider with nearly $1.4 billion in additional debt . Investors and customers alike had railed against the deal when it was first announced in August 2023, with the former calling it too expensive and accusing Forward Air of skirting a traditional shareholder vote to carry it out. The latter were upset that Forward had essentially acquired a freight forwarding competitor. Forward and Omni engaged in dueling lawsuits after the acquirer felt the heat of the reaction and sought to exit the deal, but the merger finally closed in January 2024 under amended conditions . Both Tom Schmitt and J.J. Schickel, the pre-acquisition CEOs of Forward Air and Omni Logistics,\u00a0were casualties of the merger . Multiple other execs in the C-suite departed in the time since, most recently president and chief operating officer Chris Ruble, who was terminated in December. Shawn Stewart, who headed up Ceva Logistics\u2019 North America division from April 2020 to March 2024, replaced Schmitt in the role in April. Stewart said in the statement that Forward Air has implemented the initial phase of the broader Omni integration strategy in its current quarter. \u201cOur initial actions have primarily been focused on structural changes which streamline operations and better support our long-term growth initiatives,\u201d said Stewart. \u201cGrowing our business, operating more efficiently and rightsizing our cost structure will allow us to better serve our customers, take advantage of anticipated demand when the market normalizes and capture the potential of the combined legacy companies.\u201d Story Continues In the fourth quarter, Forward Air has also reduced operating expenses by cutting some of its workforce, consolidating terminal operations and reducing the use of third-party vendors. These efficiencies are expected to save approximately $20 million in savings on an annualized basis. These savings are in addition to previously announced $75 million in merger integration synergies, which are on track to be achieved by the end of the first quarter of 2025 in March. George Mayes, Forward Air\u2019s board chairman, said in a statement that the logistics provider is \u201cmaking tangible progress executing the Omni integration and delivering on synergy targets ahead of schedule.\u201d Separate from the strategic review, Forward had been conducting an analysis of Omni Logistics, which was described by chief financial officer Jamie Pierson on a Nov. 4 earnings call as \u201ca collection of 12 companies providing different services across the logistics spectrum\u201d prior to its acquisition. When asked on the call about the potential sale of any individual pieces of Omni, Pierson said it was too premature for any decisions to be made. \u201cAre we still undergoing analysis for those that are non-core to the future of this business? Absolutely,\u201d said Pierson. \u201cIf and when we get to a point to where we\u2019re going to decide to sell one of those groups or divisions or assets, we\u2019ll certainly let you know. But right now, it\u2019s too premature.\u201d In the two months since the earnings call, Forward has not given any updates on the future of the individual Omni services. As for the wider current strategic review of Forward Air, the company indicated that there\u2019s no guarantee that any transaction or other outcome will be approved by the board, or occur at all. The company said it does not intend to disclose developments of the review, \u201cuntil it determines that further disclosure is appropriate or necessary. Goldman Sachs is serving Forward\u2019s financial advisor throughout the review process. The investment bank advised Omni Logistics during the Forward Air merger. Forward reiterated its full year 2024 consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) guidance to be in the range of $300 million to $310 million.

The update comes after months of public criticism from investors , who have called on the company to engage in a sale process following its contested merger with freight forwarder Omni Logistics. Investors have pointed to \u201cmisguided capital allocation\u201d and poor oversight as the reasons for the Greeneville, Tennessee-based trucking company\u2019s current financial troubles. FreightWaves reported in October that the company had retained investment bankers to explore a sale. Forward\u2019s ( NASDAQ: FWRD ) problems began shortly after it announced the acquisition of Omni in August 2023. The deal was structured through a series of transactions allowing it to circumvent a vote by shareholders, who likely would have shot down the plan given the large price tag and high debt burden the transaction carried. Investors have also railed against the equity interest ceded to Omni\u2019s private equity stakeholders and raised concerns that the vertical integration would scare off Forward\u2019s legacy wholesale customers . Forward outlined a range of options on Monday but said it has no timeline on when, or if, anything will be done. The company said it implemented an additional $20 million in cost saving initiatives during the fourth quarter by reducing head count, consolidating operations at terminals and limiting its use of third-party providers. The $20 million in annualized cost reductions is in addition to the $75 million in merger synergies previously announced, which will be realized by the end of the first quarter. It also reaffirmed Monday its full-year adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization guidance of $300 million to $310 million. The recent cost reductions weren\u2019t part of the prior full-year guide and were required for the company to achieve its forecast. \u201cDuring the fourth quarter, we implemented the initial phase of our broader transformation strategy to create a truly integrated and go-to solution provider, and I am very pleased with the pace and rigor we are seeing in the early days,\u201d said CEO Shawn Stewart in a news release. \u201cOur initial actions have primarily been focused on structural changes which streamline operations and better support our long-term growth initiatives.\u201d Stewart took over in late April and has since been tasked with integrating Omni\u2019s freight forwarding platform with Forward\u2019s expedited trucking operations. Stewart replaced Tom Schmitt, who was the architect of the ill-fated merger. Story Continues Forward also said Monday it had modified its credit agreement, lowering commitments on its revolving credit facility from $340 million to $300 million. The deal gives it more breathing room on its debt covenant. Net leverage of 6.75 times is now allowed through the 2025 third quarter, stepping down to 5.5 times in the fourth quarter of 2026 and beyond. The company ended the third quarter at 5.4 times leverage and was facing a 4.5 times bogey by the fourth quarter of this year. The credit facility could be reduced further, or the company could be required to make a prepayment on its term loans, if net leverage exceeds 6.5 times in any quarter, according to a separate filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cThis amendment is intended to provide us with additional financial flexibility to continue executing our transformation and regardless of the outcome of the strategic review process,\u201d said CFO Jamie Pierson. \u201cWe sincerely appreciate the support of our lenders and look forward to capitalizing on the tremendous opportunity we have ahead of us.\u201d Pierson joined Forward in May. He has expertise in financial restructurings including two stints with now-bankrupt Yellow Corp. ( OTC: YELLQ ). Goldman Sachs ( NYSE: GS ) is currently acting as Forward\u2019s financial adviser. The investment banking firm was one of Omni\u2019s advisers on the August 2023 merger. Forward was advised by Morgan Stanley ( NYSE: MS ) and Citi ( NYSE: C ) on that deal. \u201cUnder Forward Air\u2019s new leadership team, the Company is making tangible progress executing the Omni integration and delivering on synergy targets ahead of schedule, while stabilizing the business and advancing the early stages of transforming the Company to become a global logistics powerhouse through the implementation of its strategic plan,\u201d said Forward Chairman George Mayes. \u201cRegardless of the outcome of this review, Forward will not waver in its commitment to our customers to deliver consistent high-quality service.\u201d Shares of FWRD were off 0.4% at 11 a.m. EST on Monday compared to the S&P 500, which was up 1.2%. Shares of FWRD are off roughly 70% since the merger with Omni was announced.

2025, 3:00 PM 12 min read In This Article: FWRD -4.65% FDX -6.62% SNDR -2.35% CHRW -1.40% KNX -2.38% Deal count across the trucking industry was down 5% year over year in 2024. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves) A slowdown in trucking M&A was met by interest rate cuts for the first time in more than four years in 2024. The anticipation of lower lending rates fostered more constructive transaction dialogues during the year, but deal count across the industry was still off 5% from 2023, according to data compiled by the research team at Left Lane Associates. The supply chain M&A advisory firm said there is noise in the number as some deals were paused until after the election, which pushed closings into the first quarter of 2025. \u201cWe are seeing a lot of positive M&A momentum leading into Q1 and beyond as we move further away from the tail end of the freight recession and with the more business-friendly administration coming into power,\u201d Left Lane\u2019s president, Peter Stefanovich, told FreightWaves. \u201cWe are anticipating a substantial uptick in sellers coming back to the M&A market, especially those that were planning on selling in 2023 and 2024.\u201d Well-capitalized companies generating significant cash flow were active again in 2024. Some companies executed strategic acquisitions, with others making more transformational deals. Some even provided updates on possible spinoffs. There were several notable deals in trucking in 2024. Here\u2019s a recap in chronological order. Forward Air finally closes Omni deal but drama lingers Shareholder lawsuits, court injunctions and a legal back-and-forth between acquirer and target were the 2023 headlines that followed Forward Air\u2019s ( NASDAQ: FWRD ) announcement it would merge with freight forwarder Omni Logistics. The fallout continues after Forward grudgingly closed on the deal in late January. When announced, an initial price tag of $3.2 billion drew outcry from investors who were miffed they weren\u2019t given a vote. A high debt load and a shift in control to Omni\u2019s private equity stakeholders were among chief complaints. Some of Forward\u2019s customers also had concerns that their linehaul provider (Forward) was acquiring one of their competitors. Forward has revamped its board and executive team this year as it navigates a course that includes both its legacy expedited less-than-truckload business and its newfound air and ocean freight forwarding offering. But some shareholders haven\u2019t dropped an effort to effect change at the company. The group views Forward\u2019s current strategy and high debt leverage (5.4 times adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) as untenable. Shareholders have called on Forward\u2019s board to engage in strategic alternatives, including a potential sale to private equity. Taking the company private would allow it to iron out a marketing strategy and fix its balance sheet without the burden of quarterly reporting to the public. FreightWaves previously reported that Forward had retained investment bankers to explore a sales process, but the company hasn\u2019t commented on the matter. Story Continues Shares of FWRD remain 70% lower since the deal was announced in August 2023. Shares fell 90% from the announcement date to the May 2024 low. The bounce back is likely tied to a potential sale.

The $297 million purchase price included Cardinal\u2019s 3,400 drivers, 2,900 trucks and 200 locations. Cardinal serves consumer packaged goods, omnichannel, automotive and industrial customers. In addition to being a dedicated contract carrier, Cardinal provides freight brokerage, final-mile and contract logistics services. The deal was forecast to add $1 billion in revenue ($800 million in operating revenue) to Ryder\u2019s dedicated transportation business, which reported total revenue of $1.8 billion (operating revenue of $1.3 billion) in 2023. The operation was acquired from private equity firm H.I.G. Capital and not expected to be accretive to Ryder\u2019s earnings until 2025, following integration and the realization of deal synergies. Ryder buys Cardinal Logistics, significantly growing its dedicated business TFI closes Daseke deal, eyes potential spinoff TFI International ( NYSE: TFII ) doubled the size of its specialty truckload unit when it closed on a $1.1 billion acquisition of flatbed carrier Daseke in April. The price tag represented a 70% premium to Daseke\u2019s share price and valued the company at roughly six times trailing-12-months adjusted EBITDA. Daseke was a rollup of TL fleets, completing more than 20 acquisitions of mostly family-owned flatbed operators since its 2009 inception. TFI continues to talk about splitting up into two separate publicly traded companies \u2013 one business solely focused on TL and another providing LTL, package and courier, and logistics services. TFI recently said it needs a roughly $20 billion market cap (currently $11.4 billion) to execute a spinoff. It said that would require another large acquisition likely in the $4 billion to $5 billion range. It\u2019s eyeing the U.S. LTL market and hopes to get a deal done as soon as late 2025, with a spinoff occurring as soon as late 2026. TFI has already started separating assets and real estate for an eventual split. The company also acquired LTL carrier Hercules Forwarding , which has 31 terminals and $100 million in revenue, in March. Excluding a large deal, TFI guided to $200 million to $300 million in acquisitions for 2025, which is in line with past years. Daseke now part of TFI International as acquisition closes Auto haulers combine, go public Proficient Auto Logistics ( NASDAQ: PAL ) led a roughly $180 million rollup of car-hauling peers and became a publicly traded company in May. The collective included fellow nonunion auto haulers \u2013 Delta Automotive Services, Deluxe Auto Carriers, Sierra Mountain Group and Tribeca Automotive \u2013 debuting under the Proficient name at $15 per share. The initial public offering raked in a total of $212 million in net proceeds inclusive of the customary 15% over-allotment. The Proficient network includes about 1,200 trucks producing nearly $400 million in annual revenue. In August, it announced the acquisition of Auto Transport Group, boosting its coverage in the West. That deal was expected to be immediately accretive to earnings. Shares of PAL hit a post-IPO peak of $21.01 in July but began falling as auto-hauling demand sagged. Shares took a hit in mid-October when the company provided a third-quarter update signaling weaker volumes and revenue per load. It ended up posting a 98.8% adjusted operating ratio (inverse of operating margin) in the quarter following more favorable performances (low-90% ORs) in prior periods. The stock is off 46% since the IPO. Proficient is working to fully integrate the six carriers on the same TMS and reporting systems. It\u2019s looking to improve results by placing more shipments on company-owned trucks rather than through its subhauler relationships, and to capture more backhaul opportunities across the larger platform. 5 auto haulers combining to create publicly traded trucking company RXO jumps to third-largest broker with Coyote acquisition RXO ( NYSE: RXO ) became the third largest freight broker in North America when it completed the acquisition of Coyote Logistics from UPS ( NYSE: UPS ) in September. (The deal was announced in June.) The $1.025 billion transaction valued Coyote at roughly 12 times trailing adjusted EBITDA and closer to nine times when including anticipated synergies. The debt-and-equity deal included share sales to RXO\u2019s top two stockholders: MFN Partners and Orbis Investment Management. The transaction also included a services agreement with UPS through 2030. Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves Coyote\u2019s $3.2 billion in revenue pushed RXO\u2019s top line to roughly $7 billion. There is little customer overlap between the two companies. Coyote has significant exposure to the food and beverage industry and works with large carriers and private fleets. RXO has traditionally worked with small carriers moving retail and industrial freight. RXO is now focused on extracting $40 million in cost synergies from the combination in addition to its efforts to reduce its roughly $5 billion to $6 billion in combined annual purchased transportation spend. Coyote was acquired by UPS in 2015 for $1.8 billion. RXO was spun off from XPO in 2022. RXO shares soar on news of Coyote deal; combined company to be third-biggest 3PL RXO completes $1B acquisition of Coyote Logistics Knight-Swift filling in LTL map Knight-Swift Transportation ( NYSE: KNX ) acquired Dependable Highway Express\u2019 (DHE) LTL operations for an undisclosed amount in July. This was Knight-Swift\u2019s third LTL acquisition since entering the industry in 2021. DHE had $122 million in annual revenue and a 90% OR at the time of the announcement. It operates 14 terminals in the West, providing direct one-day service in California, Nevada and Arizona. The deal was immediately accretive to Knight-Swift\u2019s earnings. Knight-Swift jumped into the LTL arena in 2021 when it acquired AAA Cooper Transportation and its approximately 70 terminals in the Southeast and Midwest for $1.35 billion. Months later, it acquired Midwest Motor Express (an Upper Midwest and Northwest regional carrier) and its 33 facilities for $150 million. Knight-Swift has also acquired more than 50 terminals and leases, including 25 properties from bankrupt Yellow Corp. ( OTC: YELLQ ), since getting into the business. Knight-Swift now has more than $1 billion in annual LTL revenue with coverage of approximately 70% of the U.S. population. The Northeast remains the last section of the map to fill. Knight-Swift acquires DHE as next piece of national LTL map Schneider acquires Cowan, nears $2B in dedicated revenue Schneider National ( NYSE: SNDR ) acquired Cowan Systems for $390 million (and some of its real estate in separate transactions totaling $31 million) in November. A margin profile for Cowan was not provided but the deal is expected to be accretive to Schneider\u2019s earnings in the first year. Cowan is a 100-year-old dedicated carrier with a fleet of more than 1,800 trucks, 7,500 trailers and a network of 500 contracted carriers (owner-operators). It primarily serves the retail, food and beverage, industrial, and building materials industries through its more than 40 terminals in the eastern U.S. It also provides brokerage, drayage and warehousing services. Cowan moves Schneider\u2019s dedicated top line close to $2 billion and its fleet to more than 8,400 tractors (nearly double where it was in 2021). Schneider acquired dedicated carriers Midwest Logistics Systems (900 trucks) for $263 million in 2022 and M&M Transport Services (500 trucks) for an undisclosed amount last year. Cowan will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Schneider, with results reported through both Schneider\u2019s TL and logistics segments. Schneider National acquires Cowan, real estate for more than $400M FedEx moves forward with plan to spin off LTL unit FedEx ( NYSE: FDX ) confirmed in December that it will move forward with a plan to spin off its LTL unit, FedEx Freight. The company first floated the idea on a quarterly conference call in June. Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves Details on the transaction were sparse but FedEx said it plans to separate the companies over the next 18 months, leaving FedEx\u2019s legacy air, ground and parcel segments (generating nearly $80 billion in revenue) and FedEx Freight ($10 billion top line) as two stand-alone publicly traded companies. Breaking away from the conglomerate model is expected to unlock \u201csignificant value\u201d for shareholders. FedEx trades at a low-double-digit multiple, but shares of best-in-class LTL carriers have traded as high as 40 times earnings since the pandemic. Estimates from experts have pegged the value of FedEx Freight as high as $30 billion. FedEx to spin off LTL unit; lowers full-year guidance A stand-alone FedEx Freight gives LTL investors another pure play Other notable deals J.B. Hunt ( NASDAQ: JBHT ) acquired Walmart\u2019s ( NYSE: WMT ) intermodal fleet of containers and chassis in February. The transaction also included a long-term volume commitment from Walmart. (No further details were provided.) J.B. Hunt later said it had sold the chassis acquired in the deal as they didn\u2019t fit the retrofitted containers in its legacy fleet. The company also said the container fleet purchase was an extension of its initiative to grow its fleet to 150,000 units by 2027. Kenan Advantage Group (KAG) made several acquisitions this year, including the addition of the largest dry bulk fleet in the Carolinas . KAG is North America\u2019s largest tank trucking company and was also rumored to be contemplating an initial public offering in April. Expedited ground service providers Midwest Express and Sterling Transportation announced a capacity-sharing agreement in May, which is aimed at creating a national wholesale linehaul network. The alliance affords the group expanded coverage and more direct routings between major airports. Midwest Express rebranded as Forwarders Xpress in conjunction with the deal. Transfix sold its brokerage unit to trucking, drayage and warehousing conglomerate NFI for an undisclosed sum in June. A 2013 digital startup, Transfix struggled with its brokerage business during a prolonged freight recession. The company pulled plans to go public in 2022. Transfix is now focused on its transportation software and data offerings. C.H. Robinson ( NASDAQ: CHRW ) announced in July the sale of its European surface transportation business to German road freight forwarder Sennder Technologies for an undisclosed sum. The business made up most of C.H. Robinson\u2019s \u201cother surface transportation\u201d unit, which recorded adjusted gross profit of $74 million in 2023. The sale is part of C.H. Robinson\u2019s strategy \u201cto get fit, fast and focused\u201d and to improve profit across its core segments. Rumors resurfaced in August that XPO ( NYSE: XPO ) was again shopping its European transportation unit . The trucking and logistics business could fetch more than $2 billion, experts have estimated. The divestiture of the unit would be the last step in the breakup of XPO Logistics , leaving XPO as a pure-play, LTL carrier. A majority stake in LTL carrier Roadrunner ( OTC: R R TS ) was sold in November to Prospero Staff Capital , a private equity firm backed by Roadrunner CEO Chris Jamroz. The group replaced Elliott Investment Management, which will retain a minority interest. Roadrunner will use an undisclosed amount of new capital from the deal to fund its organic growth initiatives and make acquisitions. FreightVana announced in December that it is acquiring Loadsmith\u2019s brokerage arm for an undisclosed amount. The deal is expected to expand FreightVana\u2019s trailer pool, boosting its power-only offering. Pitt Ohio became the 12th-largest LTL carrier in the U.S. when it acquired fellow carrier Sutton Transport in December. The deal expanded Pitt Ohio\u2019s presence in the Midwest, adding 13 terminals, 384 power units and 455 drivers. Pitt Ohio now generates more than $1 billion in annual revenue. DAT Freight & Analytics, a division of Roper Technologies ( NASDAQ: ROP ), acquired Trucker Tools for an undisclosed sum in December. The deal plugs Trucker Tools\u2019 load tracking and capacity sourcing technology, which serves more than 750 brokers and 350,000 drivers, into the DAT platform.

Big Move in Forward Air (FWRD) Stock? Zacks Equity Research Fri, Dec 6, 2024, 4:58 PM 2 min read In This Article: FWRD -4.65% Investors in Forward Air Corporation FWRD need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Dec 20, 2024 $95.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. What is Implied Volatility? Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy. What do the Analysts Think? Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Forward Air shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Forward Air is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Transportation - Truck industry that ranks in the Bottom 6% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from earnings of 7 cents per share to 21 cents in that period. Given the way analysts feel about Forward Air right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected. Looking to Trade Options? Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

to the streetwear market. The fashion brand, which was founded by Skyler Stone who lured former Brock Collection designer Kristopher Brock to join him as co-creative director, debuted its spring 2025 collection this month, offering streetwear -inspired silhouettes that are anchored in traditional tailoring and utilize higher-end fabrics. The brand is described as having a bi-coastal vibe, with the founders working between New York, Aspen and Southern California. More from WWD Coach and Matin Kim Create Collection, Campaign for Asian Market Anti Social Social Club and Cat Team on Workwear Collection EXCLUSIVE: Bape Teams With Stadium Goods for Varsity Blues Collection \u201cSomething that\u2019s unique about this collection and our design process in general is that while Sky and I have very similar aesthetics, we also have very different aesthetics,\u201d Brock said. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s been fun to develop this collection in the sense of what\u2019s going to work in both of our wardrobes and that we can both wear, but will be styled very differently.\u201d The founders explained R\u00e9lyk was born from their desire to create a more mature, streetwear-inspired wardrobe after both growing up in the punk and skateboarding scenes and feeling like they\u2019ve outgrown traditional streetwear styles. Styles from R\u00e9lyk\u2019s spring 2025 collection. The brand takes streetwear-inspired looks, like oversize silhouettes, distressed sweaters and workwear pieces, and elevate them through traditional tailoring techniques and high-quality fabrics. \u201cIt\u2019s really for that customer that\u2019s grown out of streetwear and needs a more mature aesthetic, but obviously lives in what we call counterculture American luxury,\u201d Stone said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s quiet luxury, but we have a decent amount of edge to it for guys like Kris and myself who grew up in the punk and skate scene. We felt there really wasn\u2019t somewhere that guys like us could turn to for a more polished look when you\u2019re looking in the luxury space.\u201d While this is Brock\u2019s first foray into men\u2019s fashion, he explained he has a background in traditional men\u2019s tailoring, which he is applying to his designs for R\u00e9lyk. R\u00e9lyk comes six years after Brock and his former spouse and design partner Laura Vassar paused operations on women\u2019s label Brock Collection . R\u00e9lyk\u2019s spring 2025 collection offers button-up shirts, hoodies, jackets, trousers and hats ranging in price from $190 to $1,620. The brand will drop collections four times a year for spring, fall, pre-fall and resort seasons. Styles from R\u00e9lyk\u2019s spring 2025 collection. The brand is sold on its website and through an exclusive retail partnership with Fwrd. The founders explained they wanted to work with Fwrd because the retailer has a store in Aspen, which is where R\u00e9lyk is based. Story Continues Going forward, R\u00e9lyk has plans to expand into other apparel and accessories categories, as well as evolve into a unisex brand. The founders stated they\u2019ve already seen female customers pick up their offerings. \u201cI always gravitate more toward streetwear, big silhouettes and more traditional streetwear silhouettes and Kris comes in and says this is how we\u2019re going to elevate it and this is what we\u2019re going to do to add a really beautiful tailored element,\u201d Stone said about their design partnership. \u201cYou see this piece that ends up looking more street in a lot of ways and then someone who knows design looks at it and says, \u2018This is fine tailoring, this is amazing technique,\u2019 and then that combined with the fabric makes it such a unique product.\u201d Best of WWD Photos of Noah Lyles' Fashion Barry Keoghan\u2019s Style: A Closer Look Fear of God Opens First Store at Selfridges Sign up for WWD's Newsletter .
