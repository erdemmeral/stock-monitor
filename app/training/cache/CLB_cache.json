Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar. Let us delve into the factors that might have influenced CLB\u2019s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Before that, it is worth taking a look at the company\u2019s performance in the last reported quarter. Highlights of Q3 Earnings & Surprise History In the last reported quarter, the Houston, TX-based oil and gas equipment and services company\u2019s adjusted earnings beat the consensus mark. CLB reported adjusted earnings of 25 cents per share, which was 4 cents higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This was attributed to robust performance from the Reservoir Description and Production Enhancement segments. Revenues of $134.4 million also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.1%. CLB\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the remaining one, delivering an average surprise of 4.63% This is depicted in the graph below: Core Laboratories Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Core Laboratories Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Core Laboratories Inc. price-eps-surprise | Core Laboratories Inc. Quote Trend in Estimate Revision for CLB Stock The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2024 earnings has remained unchanged in the past 30 days. The estimated figure indicates a 21.05% year-over-year increase. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues indicates an increase of 2.10% from the year-ago period\u2019s actual. Factors to Consider Ahead of CLB\u2019s Q4 Release The company primarily makes money through its reservoir description and production enhancement services, which analyze and optimize oil and gas extraction processes. CLB\u2019s revenues are likely to have improved in the quarter to be reported. Our model predicts fourth-quarter revenues to increase to $130.9 million from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level of $128.2 million. This can be attributed to the strong performance of the Reservoir Description segment, which is projected to increase 4.2% year over year, reaching $88.2 million. On a bearish note, the increase in CLB\u2019s costs might have dented its to-be-reported bottom line. The company\u2019s fourth-quarter total operating expenses are likely to have been $115.2 million, up 1.3% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level.\u00a0 Moreover, its costs of services and product sales are expected to have increased from $101.5 million to $103.1 million in the same time frame. Its general and administrative expenses are expected to have increased from $8.7 million to $10.1 million in the same period. Story Continues This upward cost trend indicates the broader inflationary pressures in the economy, which could dampen the company's overall profitability despite the revenue gains.
