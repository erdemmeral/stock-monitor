Small-Cap Stocks Outlook for 2025 On December 24, Global Advisors\u2019 managing partner, Tom Lee, shared his thoughts on the potential of small and mid-cap stocks in 2025. Lee pointed out that 2025 is going to be a good year for small and mid-cap stocks. Backed by interest rate cuts and the incoming administration, companies are going to be expansionary and feel confident about mergers, added Lee. Moreover, Lee has reiterated that small-cap stocks are trading at a discount with a medium P/E multiple of 10. In an interview with CNBC, Lee said: \u201cI think small caps could in the next couple of years outperform by more than 100%.\u201d New Street Advisors CEO Delano Saporu has similar thoughts and believes that small-cap stocks are well-positioned to outperform in 2025. The economy has shown resilience in 2024, especially the recovery in the last quarter has signaled a promising outlook for businesses. Donald Trump\u2019s win has already driven significant gains in small-cap stocks amid the growing enthusiasm around the potential easing of regulations on businesses. Small-cap stocks are conventionally focused on the domestic market, with less exposure to international trade compared to large-cap counterparts. Therefore, Trump\u2019s tariff policies will not have a major impact on small-cap stocks compared to large-cap stocks.

(NASDAQ:EXFY), insiders continue to have the largest holding even though they have sold shares recently editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Wed, Jan 8, 2025, 2:09 PM 4 min read In This Article: EXFY +1.96% Key Insights Expensify's significant insider ownership suggests inherent interests in company's expansion The top 12 shareholders own 51% of the company Insiders have sold recently To get a sense of who is truly in control of Expensify, Inc. ( NASDAQ:EXFY ), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 34% to be precise, is individual insiders. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Despite selling some shares recently, insiders control a good portion of the company's stock. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Expensify, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Expensify NasdaqGS:EXFY Ownership Breakdown January 8th 2025 What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Expensify? Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Expensify. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Expensify's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. NasdaqGS:EXFY Earnings and Revenue Growth January 8th 2025 We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Expensify. The company's largest shareholder is Steve McLaughlin, with ownership of 13%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.5% and 7.3% of the stock. David Barrett, who is the second-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Chief Executive Officer. A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 12 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too. Insider Ownership Of Expensify While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. Story Continues Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Expensify, Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$310m, and insiders have US$105m worth of shares in their own names. It is great to see insiders so invested in the business. It might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public Ownership The general public-- including retail investors -- own 30% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders. Private Equity Ownership Private equity firms hold a 5.3% stake in Expensify. This suggests they can be influential in key policy decisions. Some might like this, because private equity are sometimes activists who hold management accountable. But other times, private equity is selling out, having taking the company public. Next Steps: It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Expensify better, we need to consider many other factors.

Business Wire Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 12:00 AM 20 min read In This Article: EXFY +1.96% Interchange derived from the Expensify Card grew to $4.6 million, an increase of 48% as compared to the same period last year PORTLAND, Ore., November 07, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Expensify, Inc. (Nasdaq: EXFY), a payments superapp that helps individuals and businesses around the world simplify the way they manage money across expenses, corporate cards and bills, today released a letter to shareholders from Founder and CEO David Barrett alongside results for its quarter ended September 30, 2024. A Message From Our Founder I'm happy to report that Q3'24 has extended and expanded upon the strong results of the previous two quarters: Our core business has remained stable. Though we're still catching up to last year's paid users and revenue (slightly down 5% and 3% y/y, respectively), our paid users have been stable for the past two quarters, and revenue is up 6% q/q. Even more exciting, total card spend is up 8% q/q, with a majority of that spend occurring on our new card program. Our strategy of using Expensify Classic as a stable foundation on which to launch New Expensify for our next generation of growth is working great. We are raising our 2024 free cash flow guidance, again. We initially announced FY'24 FCF guidance in Q1'24 in the range of $10.0 - $12.0 million. In Q2 we raised this to $11.0 - $13.0 million, and then again to $15.0 - $16.0 million in Q3 as the full extent of our cost cutting measures came online. I'm happy to share that we've found even more efficiencies, and are increasing FY'24 FCF guidance by another 27% to $19.0 - $20.0 million. The new Expensify Card program is almost fully deployed. As of the end of Q3, 94% of Expensify Card spend has transitioned to the new program, which in addition to earning more interchange per swipe, also treats all that interchange as revenue. We are increasingly confident in our ability to reduce interchange from the old program down to immaterial amounts or even $0 by EOY, making the confusing interchange contra-expense a distant memory. New Expensify is driving more interest and new leads. Market reception has been fantastic: we generated 61% more leads at Suiteworld 2024 by focusing on New Expensify than we did at the same conference in 2023 with Classic. We are currently sending a slice of our smallest leads from the Expensify homepage to New Expensify, and our sales and account management organizations are gradually perfecting their New Expensify pitch for maximum effect, the current iteration sounding something like: The best expense tools (including Expensify) can automate about 80% of your expense workflow based on the information on the transaction alone. But the last 20% requires information not available on the receipt or card swipe: the client you're meeting, the conference you're attending, etc. That part requires emailing a question to the employee\u2026 and then waiting. Even if your question only takes a second to answer, they might take a month to respond, blowing up your accounting timeline. New Expensify's mobile-first, chat-first design streamlines that 20% by helping your question get answered at \"the speed of chat\", taking precedence over their email inbox. But additionally, by capturing the general chat leading up to the expense (and after it's made), we expect that our AI will soon be able to automate that 20% without needing to ask the employee anything. We believe that New Expensify will be the only expense management tool to achieve 100% end-to-end automation. Story Continues Expensify Travel is generating new revenue. Beta customers continued booking travel in Q3, which resulted in Expensify Travel driving new revenue for the first time. Our initial travel beta has been completed, and we've expanded the beta to a targeted group of mid-market customers. Expensify Classic is proving to be an excellent foundation on which to launch New Expensify and Expensify Travel, and the entire company has shifted its focus toward supporting the growth of these two products in the market. I can't wait to share more progress soon! -david Founder and CEO of Expensify Third Quarter 2024 Highlights Financial: Revenue was $35.4 million, a decrease of 3% compared to the same period last year. Generated $3.7 million of cash from operating activities. Free cash flow was $6.7 million. Net loss was $2.2 million, compared to $17.0 million for the same period last year. Non-GAAP net income was $5.4 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $9.7 million. Interchange derived from the Expensify Card grew to $4.6 million, an increase of 48% compared to the same period last year. See Financial Outlook section for Free Cash Flow guidance for fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. Business: Paid members - Paid members were 684,000, a decrease of 5% from the same period last year. New Expensify Card program - The majority of active Expensify Card customers began transitioning to the new program, with 94% of spend migrated by end of Q3. Expensify Travel - Expensify Travel has completed its initial beta and has expanded its beta to a targeted group of mid-market customers. Financial Outlook Expensify's outlook statements are based on current estimates, expectations and assumptions and are not a guarantee of future performance. The following statements are forward-looking and actual results could differ materially depending on market conditions and the factors set forth under \"Forward-Looking Statements\" below. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve the results expressed by this guidance. Free Cash Flow Expensify estimates Free Cash Flow of $19.0 million to $20.0 million for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. The Company does not provide a reconciliation for free cash flow estimates on a forward-looking basis because it is unable, without making unreasonable efforts, to provide a meaningful or reasonably accurate calculation or estimation of net cash provided by operating activities and certain reconciling items on a forward-looking basis, which could be significant to the Company's results. Stock Based Compensation An estimate of expected stock-based compensation for the next four fiscal quarters is as follows, which is driven primarily by the pre-IPO grant of RSUs issued to all employees (which vest quarterly over eight years with approximately five years remaining). Est. stock-based compensation (millions) Q4 2024 Q1 2025 Q2 2025 Q3 2025 Low High Low High Low High Low High Cost of revenue, net $ 2.7 $ 3.4 $ 2.5 $ 3.2 $ 2.2 $ 2.9 $ 2.0 $ 2.7 Research and development 2.3 3.0 2.2 2.9 1.9 2.6 1.8 2.5 General and administrative 1.4 1.8 1.4 1.8 1.2 1.6 1.1 1.5 Sales and marketing 0.6 0.8 0.6 0.8 0.5 0.7 0.5 0.7 Total $ 7.0 $ 9.0 $ 6.7 $ 8.7 $ 5.8 $ 7.8 $ 5.4 $ 7.4 Availability of Information on Expensify\u2019s Website Investors and others should note that Expensify routinely announces material information to investors and the marketplace using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts and the Expensify Investor Relations website at https://ir.expensify.com . While not all of the information that the Company posts to its Investor Relations website is of a material nature, some information could be deemed to be material. Accordingly, the Company encourages investors, the media and others interested in Expensify to review the information that it shares on its Investor Relations website. Conference Call Expensify will host a video call to discuss the financial results and business highlights at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time today. An investor presentation and the video call information is available on Expensify\u2019s Investor Relations website at https://ir.expensify.com . A replay of the call will be available on the site for three months. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), we provide certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net loss, and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our business, measuring our performance, identifying trends affecting our business, formulating business plans and making strategic decisions. Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management team. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled metrics or measures presented by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for financial information presented under GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures versus comparable financial measures determined under GAAP. For example, other companies in our industry may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance. All of these limitations could reduce the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP is at the end of this press release. Adjusted EBITDA. We define adjusted EBITDA as net loss from operations excluding provision for income taxes, interest and other expenses, net, depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP net income. We define non-GAAP net income as net loss from operations excluding stock-based compensation. Free cash flow. We define Free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities excluding changes in settlement assets and settlement liabilities, which represent funds held for customers and customer funds in transit, respectively, reduced by the purchases of property and equipment and software development costs. The tables at the end of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements provide reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to each of these non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-Looking Statements Forward-looking statements in this press release, or made during the earnings call, which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1955. These statements include statements regarding our strategy, future financial condition, future operations, future cash flow, projected costs, prospects, plans, objectives of management and expected market growth, product developments and their potential impact and our stock-based compensation estimates and involve known and unknown risks that are difficult to predict. As a result, our actual results, performance or achievements may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"shall,\" \"should,\" \"expects,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"could,\" \"intends,\" \"target,\" \"projects,\" \"contemplates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" \"potential,\" \"goal,\" \"ambition,\" \"objective,\" \"seeks,\" \"outlook,\" or \"continue\" or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans, or intentions. Such forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by us and our management, are inherently uncertain. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to: the impact on inflation on us and our members; our borrowing costs have and may continue to increase as a result of increases in interest rates; our expectations regarding our financial performance and future operating performance; our ability to attract and retain members, expand usage of our platform, sell subscriptions to our platform and convert individuals and organizations into paying customers; the timing and success of new features, integrations, capabilities and enhancements by us, or by competitors to their products, or any other changes in the competitive landscape of our market; the amount and timing of operating expenses and capital expenditures that we may incur to maintain and expand our business and operations to remain competitive; the sufficiency of our cash, cash equivalents and investments to meet our liquidity needs; our ability to make required payments under and to comply with the various requirements of our current and future indebtedness; our cash flows, the prevailing stock prices, general economic and market conditions and other considerations that could affect the specific timing, price and size of repurchases under our stock repurchase program or our ability to fund any stock repurchases; geopolitical tensions, including the war in Ukraine and the escalating conflict in Israel, Gaza and surrounding areas; our ability to effectively manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the expenses associated with being a public company; the size of our addressable markets, market share and market trends; anticipated trends, developments and challenges in our industry, business and the highly competitive markets in which we operate; any adverse impact on our business operations as a result of using artificial intelligence or other machine learning technologies in our services; our expectations regarding our income tax liabilities and the adequacy of our reserves; our ability to effectively manage our growth and expand our infrastructure and maintain our corporate culture; our ability to identify, recruit and retain skilled personnel, including key members of senior management; the safety, affordability and convenience of our platform and our offerings; our ability to successfully defend litigation brought against us; our ability to successfully identify, manage and integrate any existing and potential acquisitions of businesses, talent, technologies or intellectual property; general economic conditions in either domestic or international markets, and geopolitical uncertainty and instability, including as a result of the 2024 United States presidential election; our protections against security breaches, technical difficulties, or interruptions to our platform; our ability to maintain, protect and enhance our intellectual property; and other risks discussed in our filings with the SEC. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth above. We caution you not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which are made only as of the date of this press release. We do not undertake or assume any obligation to update publicly any of these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, new information or future events, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking statements, except to the extent required by applicable law. If we update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.

And with that, I'll hand it over to Anu to get us started. Anu Muralidharan Thank you for that intro [Nicky]. I am pretty excited to walk all of you through our third quarter financial performance. And highlights, notably, we've made some pretty key strides towards stabilizing the business, improving the core fundamentals and also laying down a stronger foundation for our future growth. So let's dive into the details. First off revenue in Q3 total revenue came in at $35.4 million. This is a 6.3% increase quarter-over-quarter and we also beat the street consensus forecast. So we're pretty excited about that, pretty proud of that. Now, admittedly, this was a 3% decrease year-over-year and that reflects some lingering challenges in the business. But on near term momentum makes us more optimistic about the upcoming quarters. And the new expensify platform is also expected to continue to pick up and contribute towards that revenue group. In Q3, average paid members came in flat quarter over quarter at 684,000 and that represents a 5% decrease compared to the same period last year. Interchange from the Expensify Card was $4.6 million and that was a whopping 48% increase compared to the same period last year. And that is a pretty key highlight this quarter and I will get into some more details on that in a few slides. Let's talk a little bit about cash performance. A standout highlight for Q3 was our free cash flow performance which came in at $6.7 million. Now operating cash flow which includes the timing of customer funds came in at $3.7 million. Net loss was $2.2 million in Q3 with non-GAAP net income of $5.4 million. Last but perhaps the most exciting is our adjusted EBITDA which came in at $9.7 million. Now, the continued improvement in profitability and free cash flow, it's driven by two things, a higher interchange take rate as we start moving more and more of our spend towards our new card program. And also our continued focus on our core cost efficiency, which continues to show effects in terms of profitability. Let's talk a little bit more about free cash flow and get into our free cash flow guidance a little bit. Now, given our very strong performance in terms of adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. Last quarter, we increased our free cash flow guidance for the year from $11 million to $13 million to $15 million to $16 million. This quarter, we are going to do that again. We're going to increase it again and we are giving you a free cash flow guidance for the year of $19 million to $20 million. So again, free cash flow performance, profitability improvements have been a key highlight this quarter and we're very proud of the fact that our continued efforts to stabilize the business is showing results. Now, as promised, let's talk a little bit more about those Expensify Card updates. This is one of our very exciting growth drivers, Expensify Card and interchange revenue from expensify card increased. 48% year-over-year. The launch of the New Expensify Card program has been very well received and the migration effort if I may say so has exceeded even our expectations, 94% of our existing card spent has already been migrated to the new program, which is pretty incredible given it's been less than a year since its launch. And the new program is all new customers on the card are bringing directly on board to the new program. Now, the new program allows us to earn 20% more interchange. So it has a higher take rate and this is expected to further bolster our revenue growth in the coming quarters. So let's break down the details of the interchange this quarter in a little bit more detail. The existing old program generated a net interchange of $0.9 million. Our new program generated interchange of $3.7 million and so taking together total interchange came in at $4.6 million. We are pretty committed to getting that 94% spend number that's been migrated to the new program up to 100% before the end of year. We have a lot of, you know, irons in the fire and they're all going pretty well. So we feel pretty confident that we can hit that 100% number. Now last but not the least that we do every quarter. We give you a look ahead on paid active uses. October's paid active uses came in at 693,000, which is a 1% improvement versus the Q3 number. And we're pretty excited about that. We're hopeful that the trend continues and we see a much better Q4 in terms of paid members and subscription revenue. With that I hand things over to David to talk a little bit about business highlights. Story Continues David Barrett Thanks for that Anu. So at this point as well, I typically go through the road map and talk about basically the new developments we've had since. But I would say for the Q3 quarterly highlights right now, I'd like to talk about what we've learned on the road. So as mentioned last quarter, we put a lot of work into taking the product out to market and we've been at a couple conferences and got a lot of real world feedback from customers and the feedback has been great. I think in the process, we sort of learned some really key things with the value of New Expensify and why it's going to create so much value in this market. We call it kind of the 80%-20% advantage. And so if you really think about it, what we found is that expense management historically, has only ever been able to automate about 80% of the workflow. And that's basically as much of the workflow you can automate and the information that's on the transaction itself. The either off the credit card transaction or off the receipt. But at some point, there's a remaining 20%. And the 20% is where all the actual pain of expense management is. And that's the information that isn't on the transaction itself. It's information you have to go and actually ask a human about not asking a human is the part that everyone despises because that's where you actually have to go nag your employees or your employees to get nagged by our accounting team. And no one likes that part. And that part is because it's information required to code the Expensify that only a human knows. And so the first part of New Expensify is trying to automate the process of gathering that 20% by streamlining the conversation around it. And that's why we have this what we call a chat centric design for new Expensify. Because historically, you think about if you need to get this information, you do it by emailing someone and then you're operating at email speed and email speed is super slow, like I don't know about your inbox, but if you email me, I'm not even going to see it for days or maybe weeks. And so anything that you're asking me via email is going to be days or weeks behind. But if you text me or chat me, I'll see it respond instantly. So New Expensify design is about trying to get expense management to happen at chat speed. And that's why basically bringing the chat process into the product so that people engage with the product quicker and get faster answers to the humans. So step one and New Expensify I is just about making that last 20% the most painful 20% of expense management happen at chat speed. So you can actually close the books faster. But the second part of that is enabling us for the next generation of AI. Now I know that AI is talked about everywhere and a lot of it's all made up. But I think the really key example of where AI works incredibly well because most of that 20% of the discussion is about information which already exists in chat somewhere. And so for example, imagine like you're an accountant and you see a purchase that's at some club in Vegas, for example, you could look at this and be like is this obvious fraud? And you have to go track that employee and ask them and say, well, actually, no, it's for as at a conference in Vegas and I took a client as dinner. So it's actually very clear expense. Now, normally you have to wait around by emailing them wondering if there's fraud for days or weeks until that person responds. The response itself might only take a couple of seconds for the person to do. But you have to wait days or weeks for that couple of seconds to be spent. With Expensify new design and a chat centric design trying to bring the organizational chat onto the Expensify platform that puts us into a position for our AI to see the conversation that happens both before and after the expense. And the odds are at some place in that chat conversation. They mentioned that they were going to a conference in Vegas, taking a particular client to a particular club. They either said it before or they probably after. And so in the future, Expensify AI design, it is going to be searching, not just the conversations that sends to you, but starting all the conversations that you had leading up to and after the expense itself to see if we can answer the question automatically and do the coding automatically. So, expense goal is not merely to streamline that last 20% but truly to automate that last 20%. We're aiming for the world's first -- or industry's first 100% automation expense management. We're not there yet. You can start to see how our chat centric design starts to get us there. So maybe to summarize, let's say Q3 was a fantastic quarter. It's really showed that the business has remained stable. And in particular, we say New Expensify is being powered on the foundation of Expensify Classic. And the Classic foundation is strong, it's profitable and provide an incredible resource for building New Expensify on top of it. As you can see, we've increased our free cash flow guidance once again and again, we keep finding more and more efficiencies in the organization and that's been really, really powerful for us. The Expensify Card itself almost fully deployed, I think, as you mentioned, much faster than we really expected. And we are all --we still feel very confident that we're on track for full deployment by the end of the year in 2024. New Expensify is in market. It's a real product, it is generating revenue and we're going to be the first in the market, we think to get to that -- what we think is going to be the new bar 100% automation expense management by bringing the chat centric flow into the product itself. And then finally, Expensify Travel is actually it's in market as well making revenue and we're getting great reception. So again, it's been a fantastic quarter built on a few different fantastic quarters coming up to this. And so we have a strong foundation, things are really good and we're very, very proud of this quarter. So with that, I think we'll turn it over to questions. Question and Answer Session Nick Tooker Fantastic. I believe Aaron you're here from JMP. We'll get started with your question. Aaron Kimson Yeah, that's great. Thank you guys so much. I guess the first question just off of your last comment there, Dave. For Expensify Travel, any idea on what the revenue contribution is today and how do you -- how big a piece of the business do you think that can become over time? David Barrett Well, I think it can become quite big because, I mean, travel and expense [team] is the entire category. And so I think that we're seeing that it's just becoming sort of table stakes for expense management in general. And so every one of our customers I think has basically a travel requirement. And so I think it has the potential for actually offering quite a lot of lift. Now, we're still getting started with it. We're rolling it out. We've got great early traction, but I don't think we have anything we're sort of ready to share at this point. Aaron Kimson Okay. That's helpful. And then switching to capital allocation. So the company bought back 646,000 shares from [David] [234] share on August 28. And that was the only stock the company bought back in 3Q. Can you help us think about how you plan to manage the buyback going forward between repurchasing shares in private transactions like that one versus buying shares in the public market where your stock super liquid. David Barrett I'd be curious for your thoughts on this, but my quick thoughts are, I think that we're very opportunistic. I mean, we've built up quite a cash reserve that we can use and deploy very quickly and so I don't think we know exactly the best way to deploy it in the future. But as we've shown we're pretty flexible and I think we're investigating all opportunities. But anyway [Anu] what you think of that. Anu Muralidharan Yeah, I agree. We're pretty bullish on the company. We, you know, a lot of what, my business or like financial highlights focused on was really just getting the core fundamentals to a really strong place and now that we are in that place where we feel like the business is kicking off cash and doing it reliably. And we're optimistic in terms of growth, I think in the future quarters, we should be a little more bullish in terms of doing buybacks, but we don't have anything concrete to share just yet. Aaron Kimson Okay, thank you guys. Nick Tooker Perfect. Steven, I believe you're here with Citi. Hey, great. Thanks for taking the questions here. I guess -- I want to ask on the sub user side and good to see that, see that tick up and stabilize and I guess. Curious if you have an idea of maybe what's helping support that check up, like is there something that you feel like you've done that's helping drive that number in the right direction or does it feel like the macro is getting better? Just kind of how would you kind of articulate maybe what's going on there? Anu Muralidharan Yeah, I can take this. So, we are like I was saying, we're pretty optimistic going into the future quarters as New Expensify, sort of ramps up more and more and we start to send more and more of our traffic there that, conversion is going to perform much better and new customer growth is going to do better. But -- and I think we've talked about this in the past quarters, the really big driver for paid member growth in general over the years has always been existing customers increasing their usage on Expensify. And there were only really, there were really only two years that particular metric was stressed, that was in 2020 peak COVID and then 2023 and largely when customers are still using the product, but they're not expanding. It's, and we've looked at the correlation between that and churn try to see if it may be an early indicator, but it isn't. Largely it seems driven by macro. So we all know that, last year and even, some parts of this year have been, there's been a lot of news about layoffs, companies aren't expanding overall. So that kind of makes sense that metric is stressed and we talk about this more next quarter so that we have a full year's worth of data. But we're seeing some of that existing customer usage expansion sort of rebounding. So I think that's definitely giving us some tailwinds. Okay. All right. That makes sense. And then maybe on the go to market side. And I know there's been some, I guess evolution of what that looks like through this year. So, how are you kind of seeing the most recent kind of changes resonating and how are you kind of viewing the efficacy of some of those investments? Anu Muralidharan You mean on the new platform specifically? Yeah, just in terms of the go to market and the trying to capture new users and customers and all that. Anu Muralidharan Yeah, so we've always had the most amount of success with organic channels. So like SEO, word-of-mouth, it just the strength of our brand. So we see a vast majority of our new sign ups and even just visitors coming directly to us and that kind of continues and it's a really good leading indicator always that we are never starved for leads. So we continue to keep on doubling down on improving conversion, like improving sales efficiency, but also the product's ability to convert better and better with our new platform. We're still in early days. What we're doing is sending all of the smaller leads to our new platform in order to really dial in conversion so that we can keep what's working, improve what's new and then start to redirect all of our new leads to the new platform. And that effort is probably going to take us the next few quarters and we'll have, more substantial numbers or specific numbers for you down the line. But overall, I think our go to market and that's part of why we're able -- business is able to kick off cash. So effectively is because we are doing really well in organic channels and word-of-mouth and continuing to focus on conversion. So that's sort of still the focus of our go to market efforts. Did that answer your question? David Barrett And maybe I could add to that a little bit. I would say, I think that I agree with everything that Anu just said. And I would say a big part of the go to market strategy is building a product that just inspires leads and customers more and just to give kind of like one anecdotal example. So we go to a [suite] world every year and we go with basically the same pitch, same product and things like this. It's always been a very, very good conference for us because [Netsuite] is a major partner of ours, we do very well in that channel. And so we went to the same conference with the same size booth. But this year we were pitching New Expensify rather than Expensify Classic. And that produced about 61% more leads out of that conference. Again, everything was the same except for the platform. And so I think we see that the major strategy for launch growth is really just to launch a platform that inspires and captures the imagination of customers better, which translates into more viral lead generation through word-of-mouth and higher conversion. And so I think these are very cost effective ways to increase the conversion of our existing organic lead structure and then double down on those organic leads. Okay. That's great. That's helpful contact and a great example there. So, appreciate that and appreciate you taking my questions here. Nick Tooker Fabulous. Eric from Lake Street Capital. I believe you're able to join us. Yeah. I had a question regarding the interchange from travel traction. You had obviously a nice shift here Q2 to Q3. Are we seeing any green shoots in interchange from the travel offering that you guys have? And if not, when should we see that? Anu Muralidharan I don't think we're breaking it out in that degree of detail. And if I'm being honest, do you mean like travel as a product doesn't always -- like a customer that is using travel as a product isn't always using our card. So there's -- I'm not sure what the connection is between those two from an interchange perspective. Yeah, it was just, to the extent they're using the card to book [travel]. Anu Muralidharan Okay. Yeah, I think that is probably not meaningful because that's a pretty, subset of what we would look at both in terms of card spent travel and travels total spent on card. David Barrett Yeah, maybe I would say one of the, I think advantages that we have in the market place is our card agnosticism that we support all third party fee and card fees. And so I think it's great and I think things do work best when you use the Expensify Card in conjunction with Expensify Travel, but there's no requirement to. And so certainly, I think a lot of our sense by travel, customers just continue using their existing corporate card program and that's fine. We make money other way. Okay. And then the second question is regarding the increase in the free cash flow, I joined the call late, but were there other -- were there cost efforts taken to the point where you had maybe a reduction in force or are these more on the cost of goods side where you're continuing to squeeze costs out of the business? Anu Muralidharan Yeah, it's the latter. We didn't have any workforce decrease or anything like that. We are continuing to operationally get more efficient and that is the second driver. So there was the higher interchange take rate but also operational efficiencies taken together, gave us a higher free cash flow margin. Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Nick Tooker Fantastic. That was everyone we have on the call live. David Barrett Great. Hey, well, it's been a real pleasure. Thank you so much for joining us for this call. We're very excited about this quarter's results and we can't wait to talk to you next quarter. Anu Muralidharan Thanks everyone.
