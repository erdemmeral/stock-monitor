PORTFOLIO DIAGNOSTICS Average Market Cap 1 $2538.9M Weighted Average P/E 2 22.8x Weighted Average P/B 2 2.9x Net Assets $81.8M Net Leverage 1.9\u00a0% 1 Geometric Average : This weighted calculation uses each portfolio holding's market cap in a way designed to not skew the effect of very large or small holdings; instead, it aims to better identify the portfolio's center, which Royce believes offers a more accurate measure of average market cap than a simple mean or median. 2 Harmonic Average : This weighted calculation evaluates a portfolio as if it were a single stock and measures it overall. It compares the total market value of the portfolio to the portfolio's share in the earnings of its underlying stocks. The Price-Earnings , or P/E, ratio is calculated by dividing a company's share price by its trailing 12-month earnings-per-share (EPS). The Fund's P/E ratio calculation excludes companies with zero or negative earnings (16% of portfolio holdings as of 12/31/24). The Price-to-Book, or P/B, Ratio is calculated by dividing a company's share price by its book value per share. Story Continues The Price-to-Book , or P/B, Ratio is calculated by dividing a company's share price by its book value per share. Net leverage is the percentage, in excess of 100 %, of the total value of equity type investments, divided by net assets.

The stock is up 7.5% since reporting and currently trades at $80.21. Read our full, actionable report on Fortive here, it\u2019s free. Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our 9 Best Market-Beating Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

One Stock to Buy Instead Over the past six months, ESAB has been a great trade, beating the S&P 500 by 21.7%. Its stock price has climbed to $117.62, representing a healthy 27.8% increase. This was partly due to its solid quarterly results, and the run-up might have investors contemplating their next move. Is there a buying opportunity in ESAB, or does it present a risk to your portfolio? Get the full breakdown from our expert analysts, it\u2019s free . Despite the momentum, we're sitting this one out for now. Here are three reasons why ESAB doesn't excite us and a stock we'd rather own. Why Is ESAB Not Exciting? Having played a significant role in the construction of the iconic Sydney Opera House, ESAB (NYSE:ESAB) manufactures and sells welding and cutting equipment for numerous industries. 1. Long-Term Revenue Growth Disappoints A company\u2019s long-term sales performance signals its overall quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last three years, ESAB grew its sales at a tepid 4.7% compounded annual growth rate. This was below our standard for the industrials sector. ESAB Quarterly Revenue 2. Slow Organic Growth Suggests Waning Demand In Core Business In addition to reported revenue, organic revenue is a useful data point for analyzing Professional Tools and Equipment companies. This metric gives visibility into ESAB\u2019s core business because it excludes one-time events such as mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures along with foreign currency fluctuations - non-fundamental factors that can manipulate the income statement. Over the last two years, ESAB\u2019s organic revenue averaged 4.8% year-on-year growth. This performance was underwhelming and suggests it may need to improve its products, pricing, or go-to-market strategy, which can add an extra layer of complexity to its operations. ESAB Organic Revenue Growth 3. EPS Barely Growing We track the change in earnings per share (EPS) because it highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable. ESAB\u2019s weak 3.9% annual EPS growth over the last three years aligns with its revenue performance. On the bright side, this tells us its incremental sales were profitable. ESAB Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) Final Judgment ESAB isn\u2019t a terrible business, but it isn\u2019t one of our picks. With its shares outperforming the market lately, the stock trades at 22.4\u00d7 forward price-to-earnings (or $117.62 per share). This valuation tells us a lot of optimism is priced in - we think there are better investment opportunities out there. Let us point you toward MercadoLibre, the Amazon and PayPal of Latin America . Stocks We Like More Than ESAB With rates dropping, inflation stabilizing, and the elections in the rearview mirror, all signs point to the start of a new bull run - and we\u2019re laser-focused on finding the best stocks for this upcoming cycle.

Should You Buy the Dip in Esab (ESAB) Zacks Equity Research Mon, Jan 6, 2025, 5:35 PM 2 min read Esab (ESAB) has been beaten down lately with too much selling pressure. While the stock has lost 8.2% over the past four weeks, there is light at the end of the tunnel as it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts expect the company to report better earnings than they predicted earlier. Guide to Identifying Oversold Stocks We use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30. Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal. So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound. However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision. Here's Why ESAB Could Experience a Turnaround The heavy selling of ESAB shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 28.06. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand. 3-month RSI Chart for ESAB The RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term. On the fundamental side, there has been strong agreement among the sell-side analysts covering the stock in raising earnings estimates for the current year. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for ESAB has increased 0.5%. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term. Moreover, ESAB currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

Market Update As a result of the Fed's rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has come down from frothy levels post-pandemic. The general rise in the price of goods and services is trending towards the Fed's 2% goal as of late, which is good news. The higher rates that fought inflation also didn't slow economic activity enough to catalyze a recession. So far, soft landing. This, combined with recent rate cuts (half a percent in September 2024 and a quarter percent in November 2024) have led to strong stock market performance in 2024. The icing on the cake for 2024 returns was Donald Trump's victory in the US Presidential Election in early November, sending major indices to all-time highs in the week following the election. Still, debates around the health of the economy and the impact of potential tariffs and corporate tax cuts remain. Said differently, there's still much uncertainty around 2025.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 5 Growth Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

ESAB -3.03% Key Insights Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, ESAB fair value estimate is US$136 With US$129 share price, ESAB appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value Our fair value estimate is 4.3% higher than ESAB's analyst price target of US$131 Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of ESAB Corporation ( NYSE:ESAB ) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow. We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model . See our latest analysis for ESAB What's The Estimated Valuation? We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$340.5m US$365.4m US$354.5m US$390.3m US$403.8m US$416.8m US$429.4m US$441.9m US$454.4m US$466.9m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x3 Analyst x3 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 3.46% Est @ 3.21% Est @ 3.03% Est @ 2.91% Est @ 2.82% Est @ 2.76% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1% US$318 US$319 US$289 US$297 US$287 US$277 US$266 US$256 US$246 US$236 (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$2.8b Story Continues The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.1%. Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$467m\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (7.1%\u2013 2.6%) = US$11b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = US$11b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.1%) 10 = US$5.4b The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$8.2b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$129, the company appears about fair value at a 5.4% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. NYSE:ESAB Discounted Cash Flow December 12th 2024 The Assumptions We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at ESAB as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.080. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for ESAB Strength Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry. Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows. Weakness Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Machinery market. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years. Current share price is below our estimate of fair value. Threat Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market. Moving On: Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

One Week: What You Should Know Zacks Equity Research Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 8:00 PM 4 min read Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades. While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us. Below, we take a look at Esab (ESAB) , a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score. It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Esab currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period. You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>> Set to Beat the Market? Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for ESAB that show why this maker of welding and cutting equipment shows promise as a solid momentum pick. A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area. For ESAB, shares are up 12.19% over the past week while the Zacks Metal Products - Procurement and Fabrication industry is down 0.89% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 22.87% compares favorably with the industry's 3.52% performance as well. While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of Esab have increased 33.28% over the past quarter, and have gained 68.87% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 11.83% and 34.43%, respectively. Story Continues Investors should also take note of ESAB's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, ESAB is averaging 297,634 shares for the last 20 days. Earnings Outlook The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with ESAB. Over the past two months, 5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost ESAB's consensus estimate, increasing from $4.84 to $4.94 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period. Bottom Line Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that ESAB is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Esab on your short list. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

SWK -3.29% ESAB -3.03% Q3 Rundown: Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK) Vs Other Professional Tools and Equipment Stocks The end of the earnings season is always a good time to take a step back and see who shined (and who not so much). Let\u2019s take a look at how professional tools and equipment stocks fared in Q3, starting with Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK). Automation that increases efficiency and connected equipment that collects analyzable data have been trending, creating new demand. Some professional tools and equipment companies also provide software to accompany measurement or automated machinery, adding a stream of recurring revenues to their businesses.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Hidden Gem Stocks and add them to your watchlist.
