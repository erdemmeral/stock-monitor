Growth Stock? 3 Reasons Why Cambium (CMBM) is a Solid Choice Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 8, 2025, 8:45 PM 3 min read In This Article: CMBM -3.39% Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task. That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss. However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects. Cambium (CMBM) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank. Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this company a great growth pick right now. Earnings Growth Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration. While the historical EPS growth rate for Cambium is 3.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 95.4% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 41.4%. Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio Growth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales. Right now, Cambium has an S/TA ratio of 0.77, which means that the company gets $0.77 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.35, it can be said that the company is more efficient. In addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Cambium is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 17.6% this year versus the industry average of 1.8%. Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Story Continues The current-year earnings estimates for Cambium have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.9% over the past month. Bottom Line While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Cambium a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. This combination indicates that Cambium is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.

AT&T (T) David Bartosiak Wed, Jan 8, 2025, 7:07 PM 2 min read In This Article: T +2.19% There was a time, not too long ago, when you could buy a mega cap stock with a solid divided and ignore it for decades. You knew the dividend check was always going to clear, and the company\u2019s Board of Directors was going to ensure growth of that dividend over time. Somewhere along the way, several of these stalwarts of industry slipped up along the way. Today\u2019s Bear of the Day belongs to one of those industry titans which has sort of slipped up over the last five years or so. I\u2019m talking about Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) AT&T ( T ). AT&T provides telecommunications and technology services worldwide. The company operates through two segments, Communications and Latin America.\u00a0The company is in the Wireless National industry which ranks in the Bottom 23% of our Zacks Industry Rank. The reason for the unfavorable Zacks Rank is that 4 analysts have cut their earnings expectations for the current year. What\u2019s worse is that 7 analysts have done so for next year. The bearish moves have cut the current year Zacks Consensus Estimate from $2.22 to $2.20 over the last 30 days, while next year\u2019s number is down from $2.34 to $2.14 over the last 90 days. The stock has been moving down since the start of December. It was nearly $24 then, and is off 10% since then. This is coming after a big move higher from lows of $14 in January of last year. Investors looking for other stocks within the industry that are in the good graces of our Zacks Rank have a couple of choices to investigate further. Cambium Networks ( CMBM ) and Cogent Communications ( CCOI ) are both Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks within the Wireless National industry. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Reports Q3 Loss, Lags Revenue Estimates Zacks Equity Research Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 1:20 AM 3 min read In This Article: CMBM -3.39% Cambium (CMBM) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.14 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.17. This compares to loss of $0.44 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 17.65%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post a loss of $0.21 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.25, delivering a surprise of -19.05%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once. Cambium , which belongs to the Zacks Wireless National industry, posted revenues of $43.73 million for the quarter ended September 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.47%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $43.05 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Cambium shares have lost about 78.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 24.3%. What's Next for Cambium? While Cambium has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Cambium: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

Nov 8, 2024, 6:41 PM 4 min read In This Article: CMBM -3.39% WDAY -0.87% ANET -3.24% Cambium Networks Corporation CMBM reported mixed third-quarter 2024 results, with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The leading wireless solutions provider recorded year-over-year marginal revenue growth due to strength in the Enterprise segment. Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar . Lower Point-to-Point revenues due to weakness in defense vertical affected the top line. Healthy growth in free cash flow was a positive. CMBM\u2019s Net Income On a GAAP basis, the company reported a net loss of $9.7 million or 34 cents per share compared with a net loss of $26.2 million or 95 cents per share a year ago. Lower operating expenses and top-line improvement led to the narrower loss. Non-GAAP net loss was $3.8 million or 14 cents per share compared with a net loss of $12 million or 44 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 17 cents per share. Cambium Networks Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Cambium Networks Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Cambium Networks Corporation Quote CMBM\u2019s Revenues Quarterly net sales improved marginally to $43.7 million from $43 million in the year-ago quarter. Despite growth in the Enterprise segment, net sales decline in the Point-to-Multi-Point (PMP) and Point-to-Point (PTP) businesses hurt the top line. The top line missed the consensus estimate of $45 million. Global defense spending for communications, government spending on broadband initiatives and fixed wireless adoption from tier-2 and tier-3 service providers were key growth drivers. By product category, revenues from PMP were $18 million compared with $23.6 million a year ago. Revenues from this segment fell short of our estimate of $20 million. Revenues from the PTP business were down to $9.3 million from $15.8 million in the year-ago quarter, owing to weakness in defense vertical. Net sales missed our estimate of $14.3 million. Revenues from the Enterprise business witnessed a sharp improvement to $15.2 million from $2.5 million in the year-ago quarter. Region-wise, revenues from North America increased to $21.3 million from $17.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Net sales in the EMEA region declined to $12.2 million from $14.3 million. Revenues from Asia Pacific fell to $4.3 million from $5.3 million in the year-earlier quarter. Revenues from the Caribbean and Latin America region rose to $5.9 million from $5.7 million. CMBM\u2019s Other Details Non-GAAP gross profit was $18.5 million for a corresponding margin of 42.3% compared with respective figures of $11.9 million and 27.7% in the year-ago quarter. The improvement was primarily driven by lower inventory reserve charges. Non-GAAP operating loss was $3.6 million compared with an operating loss of $15.5 million in the prior-year quarter. Story Continues CMBM\u2019s Cash Flow & Liquidity In the September quarter, Cambium generated $8.9 million in cash from operating activities against cash utilization of $0.246 million in the prior-year quarter. As of Sept. 30, 2024, the company had $46.5 million in cash with $9.3 million noncurrent operating lease liabilities. CMBM\u2019s Outlook For the fourth quarter of 2024, revenues are estimated to be in the range of $40-$45 million. Non-GAAP gross margin is projected to be in the band of 42.5-44.5%. The company anticipates non-GAAP operating loss to be in the range of $3-$5 million. Adjusted EBITDA loss is projected to be between $1 million and $3 million.

Most importantly, we generated continuing growth in the Enterprise portfolio of products. Margins improved and we delivered increased positive cash from operations compared to the second quarter 2024, and $5.2 million in free cash flow. Cambium's product sales out of the distribution channel remain higher than reported revenues, and channel inventories declined, as reported by our distributors,\" said Morgan Kurk , president and CEO. Revenues of $43.7 million for the third quarter 2024 decreased by $2.2 million , or 5%, compared to $45.9 million in the second quarter 2024, primarily due to lower Point-to-Point revenues to defense customers, offset partially by higher Enterprise revenues. GAAP gross margin for the third quarter 2024 was 39.9%, 850 basis points higher than 31.4% for the second quarter 2024. GAAP operating loss for the third quarter 2024 was $8.1 million , a $4.0 million improvement from the operating loss of $12.1 million for the second quarter 2024.

Story Continues Non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter 2024 was 42.3%, a 880 basis point improvement from 33.5% for the second quarter 2024, primarily due to a decline in inventory reserve charges and losses on supplier commitments. Non-GAAP operating loss for the third quarter 2024 was $3.6 million , an improvement from a non-GAAP operating loss of $7.9 million for the second quarter 2024. Non-GAAP net loss for the third quarter 2024 was also improved, at $3.8 million , or a net loss of $0.14 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $7.1 million , or net loss of $0.25 per diluted share, for the second quarter 2024. For the third quarter 2024, adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $2.3 million or (5.3)% of revenues, a 65% improvement from an adjusted EBITDA loss of $6.7 million or (14.5)% of revenues for the second quarter 2024. Net cash provided by operating activities was $8.9 million for the third quarter 2024, significantly higher compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $2.4 million for the second quarter 2024. Non-GAAP free cash flow totaled $5.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, an improvement compared to negative $1.8 million for the second quarter 2024. Cash totaled $46.5 million as of September 30, 2024 . As of September 30, 2024 , the company remained in compliance with its monthly liquidity covenant for its outstanding bank debt at each measurement period during the quarter, but was not in compliance with its quarterly consolidated EBITDA covenant. The company was also not in compliance with its liquidity covenant as of October 31, 2024 . The covenant violations affords the lenders the right to declare the amounts outstanding immediately due and payable, and as such, the term loan facility and the associated debt issuance costs and the revolving loan facility have all been classified as a current liability and the deferred debt issuance costs associated with the revolving loan facility have been classified as a current asset in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 .

Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes, to measure executive compensation and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures help us to identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude in the calculations of the non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that these financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business and provides information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects. Although the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures may vary from company to company, our detailed presentation may facilitate analysis and comparison of our operating results by management and investors with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results in their public disclosures. These non-GAAP financial measures are discussed below. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income as reported in our consolidated statements of operations excluding the impact of (i) interest expense (income), net; (ii) income tax provision (benefit); (iii) depreciation and amortization expense; (iv) nonrecurring expenses, (v) share-based compensation expense, and (vi) restructuring expenses. EBITDA is widely used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate the profitability of companies. EBITDA eliminates potential differences in performance caused by variations in capital structures (affecting net finance costs), tax positions (such as the availability of net operating losses against which to relieve taxable profits), the cost and age of tangible assets (affecting relative depreciation expense) and the extent to which intangible assets are identifiable (affecting relative amortization expense). We adjust EBITDA to also exclude nonrecurring expenses since this is one-time in nature and does not reflect our ongoing operations. We adjust EBITDA for share-based compensation expense which is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is dependent on market forces that are often beyond Cambium Networks' control. As a result, management excludes this item from Cambium Networks' internal operating forecasts and models. We also adjust EBITDA to exclude nonrecurring expenses and restructuring expenses as these relate to events outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations and to provide a more accurate comparison of our ongoing business results. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure defined as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures, which is disclosed as purchases of property and equipment and purchases of software in our unaudited condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors, even if negative, about the amount of cash used in our operations other than that used for investments in property and equipment. Since free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for cash from operating activities and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. Free cash flow is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. Non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP net income are used as a supplement to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP measures are the most meaningful for period-to-period comparisons because they exclude the impact of share-based compensation expense, restructuring expenses, nonrecurring legal expenses, amortization of acquired intangibles, and amortization of capitalized software costs as we do not consider these costs and expenses to be indicative of our ongoing operations. Share-based compensation expenses are excluded. Management may issue different types of awards, including share options, and restricted share units, and excludes the associated expense in this non-GAAP measure. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is dependent on market forces that are often beyond Cambium Networks control. Amortization of acquired intangibles includes customer relationships and is excluded since these are not indicative of continuing operations. Amortization of capitalized software costs include capitalized research and development activities amortized over their useful life and included in cost of revenues and are excluded since these are not indicative of continuing operations. Restructuring expenses consist primarily of severance costs for employees which are not related to future operating expenses. Cambium Networks excludes these expenses since they result from an event that is outside the ordinary course of continuing operations. Excluding these charges permits more accurate comparisons of Cambium Networks' ongoing business results. Our non-GAAP tax adjustments include the tax impacts from share-based compensation expense including excess or decremental tax benefits available to the company that are recorded when incurred. Non-GAAP results exclude the effect of a valuation allowance recorded against tax assets for the cumulative loss related to our UK and U.S. operations. Cambium Networks excludes these amounts to more closely approximate the company's ongoing effective tax rate after adjusting for one-time or unique non-recurring items. The associated non-GAAP effective tax rate is also applied to the gross amount of non-GAAP adjustments for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP net income in total and on a per-share basis. This approach is designed to enhance the ability of investors to understand the company's tax expense on its current operations, provide improved modeling accuracy, and substantially reduce fluctuations caused by GAAP adjustments which may not reflect actual cash tax expense. Non-GAAP fully weighted basic and diluted shares are shown as outstanding during the entire period presented and include dilutive shares if their effect on earnings per share is dilutive. We also use non-GAAP fully weighted basic and diluted shares to provide more comparable per-share results across periods. These non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial results and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations in the use of non-GAAP measures because they do not include all the expenses that must be included under GAAP and because they involve the exercise of judgment concerning exclusions of items from the comparable non-GAAP financial measure. In addition, other companies may use other measures to evaluate their performance, or may calculate non-GAAP measures differently, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison.
