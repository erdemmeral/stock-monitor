Medicine professors featured in documentary on vegan dog food PR Newswire Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 10:00 PM 3 min read POMONA, Calif. , Jan. 22, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- A study led by two Western University of Health Sciences College of Veterinary Medicine professors demonstrated that dogs fed nutritionally-sound vegan diets maintain health outcomes as well as dogs fed meat. This study is now the subject of a documentary by Academy Award-winning director Louie Psihoyos , produced by the Oceanic Preservation Society (OPS) and streaming on Netflix Tudum. Stream here: Can Dogs Live on a Plant-Based Diet? You Are What You Eat Explores the Answer - Netflix Tudum Western University of Health Sciences College of Veterinary Medicine Professor Tonatiuh Melgarejo, DVM, MS, PhD, (left) and CVM Associate Professor Annika Linde, DVM, PhD, MPH, published a study examining the health effects of a plant-based diet on dogs. That study is now the subject of a documentary featured on Netflix Tudum. (Jeff Malet, WesternU) The short film, \"Can Dogs Live on a Plant-based Diet?\" explores the clinical study by WesternU College of Veterinary Medicine Associate Professor Annika Linde , DVM, PhD, MPH, and CVM Professor Tonatiuh Melgarejo , DVM, MS, PhD, presented at the 2023 Western Veterinary Conference and published in April 2024 in PLOS One. Domestic dogs maintain clinical, nutritional, and hematological health outcomes when fed a commercial plant-based diet for a year | PLOS ONE The study examined the effects of a plant-based diet on 15 dogs over the course of one year. The dogs were given complete physical examinations, extensive blood and urine analyses, including nutritional and cardiac biomarkers \u2013 more than 3,000 parameters. Overweight or obese dogs lost weight, while the remainder maintained normal weight over the course of a year. No clinically significant changes occurred within blood and urine. The documentary reveals some surprising results. Vitamin D is very important for bone metabolism and immunity. Seven of the 15 dogs entered the study with vitamin D insufficiency. At the end of the study, all 15 dogs were within normal limits for vitamin D. The documentary also delves into the potential environmental impacts of shifting dogs (and cats) to a plant-based diet. The amount of meat used to feed dogs and cats in the U.S. is equivalent to the meat consumption in Italy \u2013 4.3 million tons, Dr. Melgarejo says in the film. If all dogs and cats in the U.S. had their own country, they would be the fifth largest meat-eating country in the world. An estimated 30% of the total carbon footprint for food production in the U.S. comes from dog and cat food, he said. \"To make matters worse, we are seeing dogs with similar health problems as people have on a diet that is heavy on animal products, like obesity and certain cancers,\" Melgarejo said. \"Dogs and cats are not going to go away, and we need to provide a sustainable, healthier food, not only for the dogs, but for our planet.\" Story Continues About Western University of Health Sciences Western University of Health Sciences ( www.westernu.edu ), located in Pomona, Calif. and Lebanon, Ore. , is an independent nonprofit health professions university, conferring degrees in biotechnology and pharmaceutical sciences, dental medicine, medical sciences, nursing, optometry, osteopathic medicine, pharmacy, \u00a0physical therapy, physician assistant studies, podiatric medicine and veterinary medicine.

Senior Secured First Out Notes due 2028 to be issued by the Issuer (the \"New Notes\")\u00a0and solicitation of consents by the Issuer from Eligible Holders to certain proposed amendments to the terms of the Existing Notes (the \"Solicitation\"). The Exchange Offer and the Solicitation were made pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the confidential exchange offering memorandum and consent solicitation statement, dated December 17, 2024 in respect of the Exchange Offer and Solicitation (the \"Offering Memorandum\").

flu in raw pet food Eduardo Cuevas, USA TODAY Sat, Jan 18, 2025, 3:28 AM 2 min read Manufacturers of raw dog and cat food must do a better job detecting bird flu in products sold to pet owners, federal regulators announced Friday. Several cats , wild and domestic, in the U.S. have contracted H5N1 avian influenza and died from eating raw food contaminated with bird flu. Raw foods include unpasteurized milk, uncooked meat or unpasteurized eggs. The raw pet food industry has grown rapidly despite recalls and health warnings, according to USA TODAY reporting. Pasteurization , the established process of heat treatment, can inactivate viruses, including H5N1 and other pathogens in food. Under the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s update Friday , officials said regulated cat and dog food manufacturers who sell uncooked or unpasteurized products must reanalyze food safety plans to include bird flu as a threat. The update is meant \u201cto ensure that cat and dog food manufacturers are aware of information about the new H5N1 hazard associated with their pet food products,\u201d FDA officials said. A concern from pets getting sick with bird flu is that they can potentially infect people. Humans infected with bird flu have largely had mild infections , with no spread between others. Research suggests cats , who can carry bird flu and human influenza viruses, can serve as mixing vessels that would allow the bird flu virus to mutate and become more likely to infect people. In some cases it could even cause more severe disease. Cats especially can have severe illness and death from bird flu. In Washington, 20 wild cats died at an animal sanctuary from raw food. Domestic cats have died in California , Colorado and Oregon from their owners giving them raw meat or milk products that were subsequently recalled. Dogs can also contract H5N1, though no cases have been identified in the U.S. so far. Under an FDA rule, certain animal food companies must have a food safety plan identifying and evaluating hazards for foods they manufacture, process, pack or hold at their facilities. The rule requires regulated companies to re-analyze their food safety plans when FDA determines it\u2019s necessary, which is the case with the known transmission with bird flu for raw food products. FDA encouraged pet food manufacturers and others in supply chains to use practices to \u201csignificantly minimize or prevent\u201d bird flu transmission via animal food, including with pasteurization . Companies should obtain meat, milk or eggs from flocks or herds that are healthy.

Morgan Healthcare Conference PR Newswire Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 2:00 AM 7 min read In This Article: IVBIY -12.95% IVBXF +0.95% Advancing into new stage of sustainable growth and global innovation SAN FRANCISCO and SUZHOU, China , Jan. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Innovent Biologics, Inc. (\"Innovent\") (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology, cardiovascular and metabolic, autoimmune, ophthalmology and other major diseases, participated in the 43 rd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. During the conference, Dr. De- Chao Michael Yu , Founder, Chairman and CEO of Innovent , delivered a presentation highlighting 2025 as a pivotal year for significantly business growth and concreate steps in global innovation. These efforts will further strengthen the foundation for Innovent's vision of becoming a global premier biopharma company. Clear path to sustainable growth Innovent has established itself as a leading brand in oncology, consistently gaining momentum with an expanding portfolio of synergistic products. Additionally, another key growth driver, the general biomedicine segment, features a highly competitive product lineup, poised to unlock the substantial opportunities in chronic disease areas. The company remains confident in achieving its domestic product revenue target of 20 billion RMB by 2027. Alongside rapid business growth, Innovent continues to enhance operational efficiency through effective and lean management practices, ensuring sustainable and healthy operating model. Focus on world-class technology platforms and key therapeutic areas Innovent Academy, the company's innovation engine, has built a world-class technology platform, encompassing ScFv engineering, T cell engager (TCE), VHH bispecific antibodies, Topo1i ADC, dual payload ADC, and antibody peptide conjugates (APC). These platforms have consistently delivered innovative molecules, providing a driving force for the company's long-term development. In particular, Innovent combines its world-class antibody engineering and multiple sets of differentiated linker payload technologies to create the TOPO1i ADC technology platform (SoloTx) and dual payload ADC technology platform (DuetTx), producing a pipeline of potential best-in-class (BIC) or first-in-class ( FIC) ADC candidates. The company has so far advanced 8 ADC candidates into clinic trials, supported by efficacy and safety data from over 600 patients, with multiple ADCs receiving breakthrough therapy designation (BTD). This further validates the differentiated advantage of the company's ADC platform technology and its strong clinical execution. Story Continues Innovent continues to focus on high-potential therapeutic areas in oncology and general biomedicine. The \"PD-1+precision therapies\" pipeline strengthens its leadership in oncology, while the \"IO+ADC\" strategy is set to transform cancer treatment. Meanwhile, its general biomedicine pipeline covers next generation treatments for autoimmune, cardiovascular and metabolic, and ophthalmic diseases, aiming to elevate treatment standards for diverse patient populations. Embracing new opportunities in global innovation Innovent Academy's advancements have paved the way for a globally competitive pipeline of next generation IO and ADC candidates. The company plans to expand into innovative ADCs, bispecific (multi-specific) antibodies, and next-generation autoimmune and CVM therapies for global development. IBI343 (CLDN18.2\u00a0ADC): Phase 3 multi-regional clinical trial (MRCT) has been initiated in China and Japan for gastric cancer. Pancreatic cancer MRCT clinical Phase 1 data shows positive efficacy and safety signals in Chinese patients and has started patient enrollment in the U.S. Pivotal clinical trials are anticipated in 2025, subject to PoC validation. IBI363\uff1aThis first-in-class PD-1/IL-2\u03b1-biased\u00a0bispecific antibody has shown promising Phase 1 clinical data, obtained from hundreds of patients in IO resistant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, and IO unresponsive \"cold tumor\" colorectal cancer (CRC). This points to its potential as the next generation IO cornerstone drug. Innovent is following up on the Phase 1b /2 expansion cohorts of these cancer types. Pivotal clinical studies in IO-resistant advanced squamous NSCLC and IO-na\u00efve advanced melanoma are planned to launch in China in 2025, subject to PoC data and regulatory communication. A Phase 2 clinical study is ongoing in the U.S. and will further expand into cohorts for NSCLC, CRC, and melanoma. IBI3009 (DLL3\u00a0ADC): Through global licensing collaboration with Roche, Innovent aims to accelerate the development of this potentially best-in-class DLL3 ADC for small cell lung cancer patients worldwide. 2025 outlook: unlocking growth opportunities Looking ahead in 2025, the company anticipates a year of rapid growth, driven by six new drug launches and further advancements in commercialization across oncology and general biomedicine. Key highlights include: Mazdutide (GCG/GLP-1): Expected approvals for weight loss and type 2 diabetes indications in the first and second half of 2025, respectively, will provide a best-in-class GCG/GLP-1 dual agonist drug offering robust weight loss and glucose reduction, substantial liver fat reduction as well as comprehensive metabolic benefits for the vast obese, overweight and diabetes population; Teprotumumab (IGF-1R): Anticipated launch as China's first anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody for thyroid eye disease (TED), addressing a 60-year treatment gap. Picankibart (IL-23p19): Approval anticipated by late 2025. Picankibart is the first globally to report that over 80% of subjects achieved PASI 90 (\u226590% improvement in psoriasis area and severity index) within 16 weeks of treatment. It also demonstrates clear advantages, including sustained long-term efficacy, effective in patients resistant to IL-17 inhibitors, and flexibility with seasonal dosing intervals. Picankibart is poised to deliver exceptional comprehensive benefits to psoriasis patients in China . As the company advances key cornerstone products in its pipeline, we are actively expanding the development of mazdutide, teprotumumab, and picankibart into additional indications to maximize the portfolio's value. Building on this solid foundation, next-generation candidates are gradually entering clinical development, aiming to address global challenges related to aging and chronic disease burden. These innovations focus on extending dosing intervals, oral delivery, and novel mechanisms of action. Looking ahead to 2025, the company plans to submit NDAs or conduct ongoing registrational trials for seven drugs, while initiating pivotal or registrational trials for seven innovative pipeline candidates, pending PoC results. Additionally, molecules with global potential and novel mechanisms of action (MoAs) will progress into PoC and first-in-human studies.

2028 issued by the Issuer (CUSIP: 05501W AC6 / U0551Y AC9, ISIN: US05501WAC64/USU0551YAC94) (the \"Existing Notes\") for newly issued 11.930% Senior Secured First Out Notes due 2028 to be issued by

Registration Study for Multikine in PD-L1 low newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients is currently in final stage of start-up preparations - full enrollment expected by Q2 2026 Plans to seek early approval based on pre-surgical response rates A positive study outcome will position Multikine as the first treatment in over 50 years for newly diagnosed locally advanced head and neck cancer patients \u2013 a population with a severe unmet medical need Development of Multikine in other cancers is planned VIENNA, Va., January 14, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--CEL-SCI Corporation (NYSE American: CVM) reported financial results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, as well as key clinical and corporate developments. \"We are very optimistic about the prospects of our investigational drug Multikine in 2025 and 2026. We look ahead to Multikine being able to deliver much needed relief to a patient population with a severe unmet medical need. We see several very important milestones and value drivers upcoming. Positive data on presurgical response rates, previously shown to be indicative of overall survival, could enable us to apply for early approval,\" stated CEL-SCI CEO, Geert Kersten. \"This confirmatory Registration Study is designed to do two things: create a new standard of care for newly diagnosed treatment na\u00efve locally advanced head and neck cancer patients; and provide survival benefit for the population of patients with low/negative tumor expression of PD-L1, those patients who have historically not responded well to widely used checkpoint inhibitors such as Keytruda and Opdivo.\" Clinical and Corporate Developments: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave CEL-SCI the \u2018go-ahead\u2019 to conduct a confirmatory 212-patient Registration Study of Multikine in the treatment of locally advanced head and neck cancer based on strong safety and efficacy data from the completed Phase 3 study which enrolled 928 patients. The FDA agreed with the pre-surgical selection of patients most likely to benefit from Multikine\u2014those with newly diagnosed locally advanced primary head and neck cancer with no lymph node involvement (determined via PET scan) and with low PD-L1 tumor expression (determined via biopsy). In this target population in the completed Phase 3 study, Multikine demonstrated a 5-year survival of 73% vs a 45% survival in the control patients and a hazard ratio of 0.35. A report on the FDA\u2019s agreement and Multikine\u2019s path forward is available on CEL-SCI\u2019s website and at the following LINK . Story Continues CEL-SCI selected Ergomed, a clinical research organization (CRO) with a strong track record of fast enrollment and high-quality study delivery, as the CRO for its relatively small registration study. Ergomed has been a strategic partner and collaborator for over 10 years and was instrumental in successfully completing the Phase 3 study. Data from an analysis of CEL-SCI\u2019s Phase 3 study were shared at the International Drug Discovery Science & Technology (IDDST) 20th Annual Congress in a presentation titled \"Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy for Head and Neck Cancer: Low Tumor PD-L1 Expression - IT-MATTERS \u2013 RCT\". Highlights of the presentation include: Multikine significantly increases overall survival in patients with low levels of tumor cell PD-L1 expression, a population in which approved checkpoint inhibitors, which inhibit PD-L1, are generally not successful 73% survival for Multikine vs 45% in the control arm at 5 years Statistically significant log rank p = 0.0015 5-year risk of death reduced in half from 55% to 27% Hazard ratio = 0.35 (95% CIs [0.19, 0.66], Wald p=0.0015) The presentation may be accessed on CEL-SCI\u2019s website at the following LINK New data from the Phase 3 study were also presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2024 Congress in a poster titled \"Prognostic significance of diagnostic staging in treatment na\u00efve, resectable locally advanced primary oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma for neoadjuvant Leukocyte Interleukin Injection immunotherapy\". Positive regulatory decision letters were received from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Paediatric Committee and the United Kingdom\u2019s Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) granting Multikine a product-specific waiver for the treatment of head and neck cancer in a pediatric population up to 18 years of age. As a result, CEL-SCI is not required to evaluate Multikine in a pediatric population as part of its license and marketing clearance review in the UK and in the European Union (EU). A patient population analysis of CEL-SCI\u2019s Phase 3 study demonstrated well-balanced populations for both overall population and the selected population for the upcoming Registration Study (N0, PD-L1 low) , providing greater confidence in the clinical results of the confirmatory Registration Study. This bias analysis, a standard process to ensure a trial\u2019s findings are reliable, analyzed detailed data on parameters including patient age, sex, race, tumor locations, and staging, demonstrating a balance between the treatment and control arms. No bias favoring Multikine treated patients was found, lending confidence that Multikine is the reason for the large increase in patient survival. CEL-SCI\u2019s cGMP state-of-the-art dedicated manufacturing facility commissioning was completed , a significant milestone toward regulatory approval of Multikine. Financial Results During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses were $18.2 million, which decreased by approximately $4.3 million, or 19%, compared to the year ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative expenses in fiscal 2024 were $8.2 million, which decreased by approximately $0.8 million, or 9%, compared to the year ended September 30, 2023. Net loss decreased by $4.6 million to approximately $26.9 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 from $32.2 million in fiscal 2023. The operating cash expenditures for the year were approximately $18.8 million. CEL-SCI\u2019s audited financial statements contained an audit opinion from its independent registered public accounting firm that included an explanatory paragraph related to CEL-SCI\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. About CEL-SCI Corporation CEL-SCI believes that boosting a patient\u2019s immune system while it is still intact should provide the greatest possible impact on survival. Multikine is designed to help the immune system \"target\" the tumor at a time when the immune system is still relatively intact and thereby thought to be better able to mount an attack on the tumor. Multikine (Leukocyte Interleukin, Injection), a true first-line cancer therapy, has been dosed in over 740 patients and received Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for neoadjuvant therapy in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (cancer) of the head and neck. Based on the data from the completed randomized controlled Phase 3 study, the FDA concurred with CEL-SCI\u2019s target patient selection criteria and gave the go-ahead to conduct a confirmatory Registration Study which will enroll 212 patients. CEL-SCI will enroll newly diagnosed locally advanced primary treatment na\u00efve resectable head and neck cancer patients with no lymph node involvement (determined via PET scan) and with low PD-L1 tumor expression (determined via biopsy), representing about 100,000 patients annually. The Company has operations in Vienna, Virginia, and near/in Baltimore, Maryland.

Selected for Registrational Trial Zacks Small Cap Research Mon, Dec 9, 2024, 12:39 PM 5 min read In This Article: CVM -3.16% By John Vandermosten, CFA NYSE:CVM READ THE FULL CVM RESEARCH REPORT CEL-SCI Corporation (NYSE:CVM) has made progress advancing the prerequisites for the upcoming registrational trial, selecting the contract research organization (CRO) that will run it and coming to an agreement with the FDA on which biomarkers are appropriate for selecting patients. The view of oncologists as expressed by the FDA\u2019s ODAC is that using checkpoint inhibitors to treat low PD-L1 expressing patients provides limited efficacy and could even be harmful. This view opens the door for the use of Multikine, if approved, in the low expressing PD-L1 patient population based on its efficacy in this group.

The poster presented graphical data comparing high risk and low risk subjects who were evaluated in the IT-MATTERS trial measuring the probability of overall survival (OS) over time. The subpopulation included in the data set consisted of 114 subjects who met the target population selection criteria. The high-risk group included patients that presented a high risk of cancer recurrence and who were recommended to undergo chemotherapy following surgery (N=35). The low risk group included patients that were recommended to be given radiotherapy but not chemotherapy after surgery (N=79). Both groups showed a survival benefit for the Multikine arm. The 79 patients who were recommended to receive only radiotherapy benefited to an even greater degree from pre-surgery treatment with Multikine compared to the wider 114 patient group. This target low risk population (n=38) had a 5-year overall survival of 82.6% when treated with Multikine vs. 47.3% when treated with standard of care alone (n=41), without overlap in their respective 95% confidence intervals. More recent analysis for the target low risk population (n=79) produced a hazard ratio of 0.27 (95% CI [0.12, 0.64], Wald p=0.0027) achieving a 73% reduction in overall risk of death. Story Continues While the overall survival benefit was clear and statistically significant (log rank p=0.0015) for the entire target population (n=114), the 79 patients who were recommended to receive only radiotherapy benefited to an even greater degree from pre-surgery treatment with Multikine than the group of 114 as a whole. This target low risk population (n=38) had a 5-year overall survival of 82.6% when treated with Multikine vs. 47.3% when treated with standard of care alone (n=41), without overlap in their respective 95% confidence intervals. More recent analysis for the target low risk population (n=79) showed a hazard ratio of 0.27 (95% CI [0.12, 0.64], Wald p=0.0027) achieving a 73% reduction in overall risk of death. Looking ahead, CEL-SCI management postulated that the use of advanced imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) may help further improve patient selection and generate a higher success rate for Multikine. PET scans will be used in the upcoming confirmatory registration study for FDA approval. Clinical Research Organization (CRO) Selection CEL-SCI selects Ergomed to serve as its CRO for the upcoming confirmatory registration study of Multikine. Details of the selection were included in an October 1 st press release . Ergomed had previously provided CRO services to CEL-SCI for the management of the IT-MATTERS trial. Ergomed will manage the trial globally at multiple sites. The announcement reminded readers that the trial will be a 212-patient study enrolling newly-diagnosed, locally advanced, primary head and neck cancer. It will focus on patients with no lymph node involvement and low PD-L1 tumor expression. The anticipated start of the confirmatory trial is 1Q:25. FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) Opinion The FDA\u2019s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) convened in September to evaluate the use of checkpoint inhibitors in different cancers and when certain therapies are appropriate depending on biomarker readings. The ODAC is a panel of expert advisors that provides recommendations to the FDA regarding cancer drugs and treat-ments. The committee consists of medical experts, oncologists, researchers, and other healthcare professionals specializing in cancer treatment whose primary role is to review and evaluate new cancer drugs, therapies, and treatments before they are approved for market use. The ODAC provided an opinion on adequacy of PD-L1 expression as a predictive biomarker for patient selection in this patient population, risk-benefit assessments in different subpopulations defined by PD-L1 expression and ade-quacy of the cumulative data to restrict the approvals of immune checkpoint inhibitors based on PD-L1 expression. After reviewing the data, the ODAC voted 10-2 and 11-1 against the risk-benefit profile for PD-L1 inhibitors in various cancers in two separate votes. Committee members expressed concerns about the lack of benefit demonstrated for patients with low PD-L1 expression, while some members pointed to evidence that the use of the imm-une checkpoint inhibitors may add unnecessary toxicities for patients while also increasing financial burdens on patients.

About CEL-SCI Corporation CEL-SCI believes that boosting a patient\u2019s immune system while it is still intact should provide the greatest possible impact on survival. Multikine is designed to help the immune system \"target\" the tumor at a time when the immune system is still relatively intact and thereby thought to be better able to mount an attack on the tumor. Multikine (Leukocyte Interleukin, Injection), a true first-line cancer therapy, has been dosed in over 740 patients and received Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for neoadjuvant therapy in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (cancer) of the head and neck. Based on the data from the completed randomized controlled Phase 3 study, the FDA concurred with CEL-SCI\u2019s target patient selection criteria and gave the go-ahead to conduct a confirmatory Registration Study which will enroll 212 patients. CEL-SCI will enroll newly diagnosed locally advanced primary treatment na\u00efve resectable head and neck cancer patients with no lymph node involvement (determined via PET scan) and with low PD-L1 tumor expression (determined via biopsy), representing about 100,000 patients annually. Leer m\u00e1s The Company has operations in Vienna, Virginia, and near/in Baltimore, Maryland.

About CEL-SCI Corporation CEL-SCI believes that boosting a patient\u2019s immune system while it is still intact should provide the greatest possible impact on survival. Multikine is designed to help the immune system \"target\" the tumor at a time when the immune system is still relatively intact and thereby thought to be better able to mount an attack on the tumor. Multikine (Leukocyte Interleukin, Injection), a true first-line cancer therapy, has been dosed in over 740 patients and received Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for neoadjuvant therapy in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (cancer) of the head and neck. Based on the data from the completed randomized controlled Phase 3 study, the FDA concurred with CEL-SCI\u2019s target patient selection criteria and gave the go-ahead to conduct a confirmatory Registration Study which will enroll 212 patients. CEL-SCI will enroll newly diagnosed locally advanced primary treatment na\u00efve resectable head and neck cancer patients with no lymph node involvement (determined via PET scan) and with low PD-L1 tumor expression (determined via biopsy), representing about 100,000 patients annually. Story Continues The Company has operations in Vienna, Virginia, and near/in Baltimore, Maryland.

About CEL-SCI Corporation CEL-SCI believes that boosting a patient\u2019s immune system while it is still intact should provide the greatest possible impact on survival. Multikine is designed to help the immune system \"target\" the tumor at a time when the immune system is still relatively intact and thereby thought to be better able to mount an attack on the tumor. Story Continues Multikine (Leukocyte Interleukin, Injection), a true first-line cancer therapy, has been dosed in over 740 patients and received Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for neoadjuvant therapy in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (cancer) of the head and neck. Based on the data from the completed randomized controlled Phase 3 study, the FDA concurred with CEL-SCI\u2019s target patient selection criteria and gave the go-ahead to conduct a confirmatory Registration Study which will enroll 212 patients. CEL-SCI will enroll newly diagnosed locally advanced primary treatment na\u00efve resectable head and neck cancer patients with no lymph node involvement (determined via PET scan) and with low PD-L1 tumor expression (determined via biopsy), representing about 100,000 patients annually. The Company has operations in Vienna, Virginia, and near/in Baltimore, Maryland.

disease: Is your cat safe? Eduardo Cuevas, USA TODAY Fri, Dec 27, 2024, 8:52 PM 5 min read Cats of all shapes and sizes have come down with bird flu . First there were barn cats that drank raw milk . In recent days, 20 wild cats at a Washington State animal sanctuary that probably ate infected birds, and reports of indoor cats that died from eating contaminated raw food. Though more may have been infected without attracting the attention of owners or veterinarians, the ones that did often suffered terrible neurological symptoms like tremors, seizures and blindness. Infected cats that have been identified have died at high rates. Their unique roles in our homes and the animal kingdom could put them \u2212 and us \u2212 at greater risk . Here's why. Why do cats get bird flu? Unlike many dogs, cats explore and hunt smaller prey, such as birds and mice, which can carry bird flu. By their very nature, cats have more \"opportunity\" to get infected with bird flu, said Dr. Michael Bailey, president-elect of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), which has released guidance for cat owners. \u201cWe don't know if the cats are more susceptible than anybody else,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's just the fact they're exposed to higher viral burdens because of where they go.\u201d Domestic cats have been known to carry bird flu since 2004 . But the death rates seen in the current U.S. outbreak seem dramatically higher than what's been seen around the world, said Kristen Coleman, an assistant professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Health. Before, about half of cats died, now with bird flu spreading among cows, about 90% seem to be dying, said Coleman, who has been tracking those deaths. What are the symptoms of bird flu in cats? The AVMA recommends pet owners look out for signs such as loss of appetite, lethargy and fever. A bird flu infection can quickly progress with neurologic signs, such as tremors, seizures, not being coordinated, or blindness. Additionally, cats can have severe depression, discharge from their eyes or nose, and respiratory signs like rapid breathing, shortness of breath, and sneezing or coughing. Story Continues If your cat shows these symptoms and you think it might have been exposed to bird flu, also known as H5N1, you should call a veterinarian immediately. Sick animals may be able to transmit influenza virus to people in their saliva, poop and other bodily fluids. People can get infected by breathing in the virus or by touching something that has virus on it and then touching their mouth, eyes, or nose. If you suspect your cat may be infected with bird flu \u2012 or any other potentially infectious disease \u2012 try to limit their contact with other pets and people in your household, particularly anyone who is immunocompromised, while waiting for veterinary guidance, according to the AVMA. Although the risk of cats spreading H5N1 to humans is considered extremely low, it is not zero. Following guidance from the CDC, you should monitor yourself and your family for any flu-like symptoms and contact a healthcare provider if concerns arise. Wash your hands after handling your cat or cleaning up after them, such as their litter boxes or bedding. Cats are at increased risk of bird flu due in part to wild birds that carry the virus. How do I protect my outdoor cat? Cats that spend time outdoors are at greater risk with exposure from dead animals, as well as wild birds or mice, which can also carry bird flu . Bailey and Coleman recommend trying to reduce their time outside. The main goal, both said, is to reduce their risk of consuming a dead animal, and certainly to stop it from bringing any dead animals into your home. How do I protect my indoor cat? Cats indoors have a lower risk of contracting bird flu, but people should still take precautions. People should avoid feeding their cats raw foods, like uncooked meat or unpasteurized milk, since these can contain virus. Raw food for pets has been trending , but the AVMA discourages people from feeding dogs or cats raw or undercooked animal-sourced food. Cooking meat or pasteurizing milk neutralizes the virus. Mice can also end up in homes. Cats can be great pest control, but an infected mouse could pose threats to their health. People should wash their hands after touching their cat and after encountering wild birds, livestock or other animals, the AVMA said. If a person has been in contact or near sick or dead animals, they should change clothes and shoes and wash any exposed skin. What about dogs? While dogs have previously contracted bird flu, for now, they appear less susceptible to it than cats, according to the Food and Drug Administration. Bird flu hasn't been found in dogs in the U.S. The same precautions taken for cats should also be used to protect dogs, according to a Dec. 13 FDA update . \u2018Mixing vessels\u2019 More than 60 people have been infected with bird flu in the U.S., mostly with mild symptoms. People have mostly gotten sick while working on dairy or poultry farms. There has been no transmission between humans yet. Cats haven\u2019t been known as a main spreader of virus circulating in the U.S. \u2012 but that could change in the future. \u201cIf us humans don\u2019t care for our animals, it\u2019s probably not going to end well for us,\u201d Coleman said. Cats can not only catch bird flu, they can also catch human flu viruses. That means cats can serve as a \"mixing vessel\" for the two types of flu, allowing them to combine and create a version of bird flu that is much more likely to infect people, according to a study published in December . The U.S. isn't fully capturing spread in pets like cats, compared to surveillance for livestock and people, said the study\u2019s senior author, Suresh Kuchipudi, a professor and chair of infectious diseases at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health. \u201cIn my view, cats should be on the top of that list,\u201d he said.
