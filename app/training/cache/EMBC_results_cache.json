\u2013 January 23, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include, Doximity DOCS, Omnicell OMCL, Embecta Corp. EMBC, Cencora, Inc. COR and the Global Telemedicine & Digital Health ETF EDOC. Here are highlights from Thursday\u2019s Analyst Blog: 4 MedTech Stocks Poised to Thrive Under Second Trump Presidency Trump's return to the White House has introduced significant uncertainty for investors in the medical device industry. Major executive actions, including the U.S. withdrawal from the World Health Organization (WHO) and a freeze on federal regulatory activities, have sparked concerns among MedTech stakeholders. As investors await clarity, the initial environment under Trump 2.0 demands close monitoring of regulatory developments and adapting strategies to mitigate risks. Be that as it may, sectors like health IT, telemedicine and digital health platforms are witnessing growth opportunities and a positive outlook. Here, we have picked four Medtech stocks that are set to benefit from the new administrative policies. These are Doximity , Omnicell , Embecta Corp. and Cencora, Inc. Executive Orders Seemingly Putting MedTech in a Tight Spot Experts apprehend that exiting the WHO may reduce U.S. participation in global health initiatives, potentially limiting collaborative efforts in combating pandemics and advancing medical research. This withdrawal could also increase risks for medical device manufacturers that rely on international regulatory alignment and data-sharing facilitated by the WHO. This could potentially increase complexity in the regulatory approval process, costs and operational inefficiencies. Moreover, the freeze on regulatory activity under the FDA and CMS until new administration appointees approve policies has placed critical decisions in limbo, delaying new product approvals and reimbursement processes. For medical device companies, this uncertainty could hinder innovation timelines and revenue projections. The potential for slowed progress in approving breakthrough therapies and devices may discourage investments in early-stage startups and clinical trials. Silver Lining: Digital Health and Telemedicine Prospects Bright The new administration repealed the former president\u2019s Executive Order on AI safety. This strategic shift signals a strong positive impact on digital healthcare and telemedicine. Apparently, this will ease regulatory frameworks for these kinds of MedTech makers to test and deploy Gen AI applications more quickly, potentially giving U.S.-based firms a competitive edge in global AI markets. Meanwhile, telemedicine is expected to align with the administration's potential focus on improving healthcare access without expanding federal oversight. Story Continues Since the Presidential inauguration on Jan. 20, the Global Telemedicine & Digital Health ETF has shown steady growth. 4 MedTech Stocks to Keep An Eye On Doximity : This leading digital platform for U.S. medical professionals is of late experiencing a significant increase in the use of its clinical workflow tool.

Poised to Thrive Under Second Trump Presidency Urmimala Biswas Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 7:51 PM 4 min read In This Article: OMCL -3.49% EMBC +0.11% DOCS 0.00% Trump's return to the White House has introduced significant uncertainty for investors in the medical device industry. Major executive actions, including the U.S. withdrawal from the World Health Organization (WHO) and a freeze on federal regulatory activities, have sparked concerns among MedTech stakeholders. As investors await clarity, the initial environment under Trump 2.0 demands close monitoring of regulatory developments and adapting strategies to mitigate risks. Be that as it may, sectors like health IT, telemedicine and digital health platforms are witnessing growth opportunities and a positive outlook. Here, we have picked four Medtech stocks that are set to benefit from the new administrative policies. These are Doximity DOCS, Omnicell OMCL, Embecta Corp. EMBC and Cencora, Inc. COR. Executive Orders Seemingly Putting MedTech in a Tight Spot Experts apprehend that exiting the WHO may reduce U.S. participation in global health initiatives, potentially limiting collaborative efforts in combating pandemics and advancing medical research. This withdrawal could also increase risks for medical device manufacturers that rely on international regulatory alignment and data-sharing facilitated by the WHO. This could potentially increase complexity in the regulatory approval process, costs and operational inefficiencies. Moreover, the freeze on regulatory activity under the FDA and CMS until new administration appointees approve policies has placed critical decisions in limbo, delaying new product approvals and reimbursement processes. For medical device companies, this uncertainty could hinder innovation timelines and revenue projections. The potential for slowed progress in approving breakthrough therapies and devices may discourage investments in early-stage startups and clinical trials. Silver Lining: Digital Health and Telemedicine Prospects Bright The new administration repealed the former president\u2019s Executive Order on AI safety. This strategic shift signals a strong positive impact on digital healthcare and telemedicine. Apparently, this will ease regulatory frameworks for these kinds of MedTech makers to test and deploy Gen AI applications more quickly, potentially giving U.S.-based firms a competitive edge in global AI markets. Meanwhile, telemedicine is expected to align with the administration's potential focus on improving healthcare access without expanding federal oversight. Since the Presidential inauguration on Jan. 20, the Global Telemedicine & Digital Health ETF EDOC has shown steady growth.

Near 52-Week High With Room to Rise Further Vasundhara Sawalka Mon, Jan 6, 2025, 4:26 PM 7 min read In This Article: REVG -3.72% EMBC +0.11% NFG +2.68% Stocks hitting their 52-week high and delivering consistent performance offer attractive opportunities to investors while building a portfolio. This is because stocks near that level are perceived to be winners. However, stocks touching a new 52-week high are often predisposed to profit-taking, resulting in pullbacks and trend reversals. Moreover, given the high price, investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced. While the speculations are not absolutely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced. In fact, investors might lose out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices. Stocks such as Embecta Corp. EMBC, National Fuel Gas Company NFG and REV Group REVG are expected to maintain their momentum and keep scaling new highs. Extensive information on a stock is necessary to understand whether or not there is scope for further upside. Here, we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks. The strategy borrows from the basics of momentum investing. This technique bets on \u201cbuy high, sell higher.\u201d 52-Week High: A Good Indicator Many times, stocks that hit a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite having potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and expect the price to crash. In fact, overvaluation is natural for most of these stocks as investors\u2019 focus (or willingness to pay a premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always indicate an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encourage investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue. Also, when a string of positive developments dominates the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces. Setting the Right Filters We ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum. Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring the continuation of their rally for some time. Current Price/52 Week High >= .8 This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.11 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range. Story Continues % Change Price \u2013 4 Weeks > 0 It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks. % Change Price \u2013 12 Weeks > 0 This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well. Price/Sales <= XIndMed The lower, the better. P/E using F(1) Estimate <= XIndMed This metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry. One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) >= XIndMed This helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism. Zacks Rank =1 No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since its inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market average. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Current Price >= 8 This parameter will help screen stocks that are trading at $8 or higher. Volume \u2013 20 days (shares) >= 100000 The inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares, so trading is easier. Here are three stocks of the five that made it through the screen: Embecta Corp. is a medical device company that provides various solutions to enhance the health and well-being of people with diabetes. Its products include pen needles, syringes, safety injection devices and digital applications to assist people in managing their diabetes. The company has received clearance from the FDA for its proprietary disposable patch pump for insulin delivery. EMBC is already working on a closed-loop version of the insulin delivery system, which will include an advanced insulin-dosing algorithm. This next-generation system is expected to offer even greater convenience and precision in insulin management, further solidifying Embecta's position as a leader in diabetes care innovation. Embecta\u2019s focus on expanding its product offerings and improving the quality of life for people with diabetes aligns with its long-term vision of a life unlimited by diabetes. As the company continues to develop and refine its technology, it is well-positioned to make a lasting impact on the diabetes care market, particularly for the underserved T2D population. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EMBC\u2019s fiscal 2025 earnings has remained steady at $2.84 per share in the past 30 days. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 39.51%. National Fuel Gas Company is an integrated energy company, which has natural gas assets located in the prolific Appalachian basin and oil-producing assets in California. The company operates through the following segments, namely Exploration and Production and Other, Pipeline and Storage and Gathering, and Utility and Energy Marketing. National Fuel Gas' systematic investments should strengthen its operations and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Strong liquidity should allow it to meet debt obligations. Its steady process of replacing and modernizing the existing pipelines should further boost earnings. The company also acquired Shell\u2019s assets, which should further boost its top-line performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NFG\u2019s fiscal 2025 earnings has moved north by 1.8% to $6.11 per share in the past 30 days. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters while missing the same once, the average surprise being 9.49%. REV Group designs, manufactures and distributes specialty vehicles and related aftermarket parts and services. On Dec. 11, 2024, REV Group announced its fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. The company\u2019s fiscal fourth-quarter net income came in at 80 cents per share, up from 50 cents recorded in the year-ago period. REV also increased its quarterly cash dividend by 20% Strong revenue growth in REV Group's Fire & Emergency segment, coupled with expanding margins, demonstrates operational improvement, particularly in its core business areas. The company's healthy order backlog combined with their strategic focus on higher-margin specialty vehicles positions them well for solid performance in 2025, while their disciplined approach to cost management and operational efficiency enhances potential profitability. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for REVG\u2019s fiscal 2025 earnings has moved north by 7.4% to $2.32 per share in the past 30 days.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Doximity DOCS, BrightSpring Health Services, Inc. BTSG and Embecta Corp. EMBC Here are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog: 3 Medical Services Stocks to Buy to Counter Labor Shortage Woes The Medical Services sector is experiencing significant transformation fueled by advancements in technology, increased adoption of value-based care and heightened focus on patient-centric solutions. Growing demand for remote treatment has led to a tremendous upsurge in digital healthcare options over the past few years. Demand for digital healthcare treatment continues to grow in the form of telemedicine-focused online medical and AI-powered technology services backed by the adoption of data and analytics. Hospitals and healthcare providers are leveraging these tools to streamline operations and improve diagnostic and treatment accuracy. Furthermore, value-based care models, which emphasize patient outcomes over service volumes, are gaining traction globally, encouraging providers to adopt preventive care measures and personalized treatment strategies. According to a recent Grand View Research report, the global healthcare analytics market was valued at $43.1 billion in 2023 and is expected to witness a CAGR of 21.1% from 2024 to 2030. Primary stakeholders \u2014 payers, healthcare professionals and patients \u2014 will benefit from all-new insights, services and levels of experience that next-generation healthcare-related data and analytical capabilities provide. Stocks like Doximity , BrightSpring Health Services, Inc. and Embecta Corp. are expected to gain the most from the rapidly transforming healthcare services landscape. Further, as the world grapples with aging populations, chronic disease prevalence, and healthcare delivery complexities, the demand for skilled nursing professionals has reached unprecedented levels. In 2025, this trend is expected to continue, further shaping the landscape of the service industry within healthcare. However, in the post-pandemic era, manual workforce shortage within healthcare has become a worldwide problem, weighing heavily on healthcare infrastructure. According to a 2024 report by Mercer, there will be a deficit of more than 100,000 healthcare workers in the United States by 2028. Within this, nursing assistants will have the biggest projected deficit compared to other healthcare occupations, signaling the need to improve talent attraction and retention strategies for this segment. By 2028, Mercer expects a projected deficit of over 73,000 nursing assistants nationwide. This has led to increased labor cost and health expenses. Story continues Industry Description The Zacks Medical Services industry comprises third-party service providers and caregivers appointed by core healthcare companies for economies of scale. The industry includes pharmacy benefit managers, contract research organizations, wireless MedTech companies, third-party testing labs, surgical facility providers and healthcare workforce solution providers, among others. Over the years, this industry has strategically moved from volume- to value-based care. The resurgence in medical tourism is further boosting the sector. This changing pattern of care calls for advanced facilities, thus increasing the need to appoint specialized external service providers. With the growing importance of effective healthcare management, the medical service industry has become an integral part of the modern healthcare system. 3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Medical Services Industry Digital Revolution: The adoption of digital platforms within the medical device space is gaining prominence in the United States. A 2024 digital health market report by Statista suggests that this market will witness a 9.2% CAGR from 2024 to 2028. The increasing availability of unstructured health data, advanced analytics, and the demand for personalized medical services underscores the growing importance of big data in healthcare. According to a Roots Analysis report, the global big data in healthcare market size is estimated to grow from $78 billion in 2024 to $540 billion by 2035, representing a CAGR of 19.20%. Other reports suggest that companies that adopted artificial intelligence technologies witnessed a 50% reduction in treatment costs and experienced more than 50% improvement in patient outcomes. Revival in the Nursing Care Market : In 2025, the role of nurses continues to evolve with advancements in medical technologies and shifts in healthcare delivery models. Telehealth and remote patient monitoring have expanded nurses' reach beyond traditional hospital settings, enabling them to provide care in rural or underserved areas. Specialized nursing roles, such as nurse practitioners, critical care specialists and geriatric nurses, are in high demand due to the growing complexity of patient needs. Going by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the overall employment of nurse anesthetists, nurse midwives and nurse practitioners is projected to grow 40% from 2023 to 2033, much faster than the average for all occupations. About 31,900 openings for nurse anesthetists, nurse midwives, and nurse practitioners are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Staffing Shortage : Despite the end of the healthcare emergency (WHO declared the end of COVID-19 as a global health emergency on May 5), the trauma of the past few years' uncertainty and commotion has forced frontline workers like doctors and medical staff to leave the field. Added to this, a drastic increase in the aging population in recent times (about 10,000 individuals aged 59-77 are joining Medicare plans daily) has made the healthcare staffing shortage more pronounced. In the article \"A Public Health Crisis: Staffing Shortages in Health Care,\" published in Favorite Healthcare Staffing, WHO predicts a shortfall of 15 million healthcare workers worldwide in 2030. Needless to say, this supply shortage has led to a significant rise in healthcare wages. Going by a HR for Health report, increased labor costs and staffing challenges have led to a rise in hospital expenses. Hospitals have experienced a 15.6% increase in labor expenses per adjusted discharge compared to pre-pandemic levels.

Stocks to Buy to Counter Labor Shortage Woes Urmimala Biswas Fri, Jan 3, 2025, 7:55 AM 8 min read In This Article: ^GSPC -0.76% BTSG +0.51% DOCS 0.00% EMBC +0.11% The Medical Services sector is experiencing significant transformation fueled by advancements in technology, increased adoption of value-based care and heightened focus on patient-centric solutions. Growing demand for remote treatment has led to a tremendous upsurge in digital healthcare options over the past few years. Demand for digital healthcare treatment continues to grow in the form of telemedicine-focused online medical and AI-powered technology services backed by the adoption of data and analytics. Hospitals and healthcare providers are leveraging these tools to streamline operations and improve diagnostic and treatment accuracy. Furthermore, value-based care models, which emphasize patient outcomes over service volumes, are gaining traction globally, encouraging providers to adopt preventive care measures and personalized treatment strategies. According to a recent Grand View Research report, the global healthcare analytics market was valued at $43.1 billion in 2023 and is expected to witness a CAGR of 21.1% from 2024 to 2030. Primary stakeholders \u2014 payers, healthcare professionals and patients \u2014 will benefit from all-new insights, services and levels of experience that next-generation healthcare-related data and analytical capabilities provide. Stocks like Doximity DOCS, BrightSpring Health Services, Inc. BTSG and Embecta Corp. EMBC are expected to gain the most from the rapidly transforming healthcare services landscape. Further, as the world grapples with aging populations, chronic disease prevalence, and healthcare delivery complexities, the demand for skilled nursing professionals has reached unprecedented levels. In 2025, this trend is expected to continue, further shaping the landscape of the service industry within healthcare. However, in the post-pandemic era, manual workforce shortage within healthcare has become a worldwide problem, weighing heavily on healthcare infrastructure. According to a 2024 report by Mercer, there will be a deficit of more than 100,000 healthcare workers in the United States by 2028. Within this, nursing assistants will have the biggest projected deficit compared to other healthcare occupations, signaling the need to improve talent attraction and retention strategies for this segment. By 2028, Mercer expects a projected deficit of over 73,000 nursing assistants nationwide. This has led to increased labor cost and health expenses. Industry Description The Zacks Medical Services industry comprises third-party service providers and caregivers appointed by core healthcare companies for economies of scale. The industry includes pharmacy benefit managers, contract research organizations, wireless MedTech companies, third-party testing labs, surgical facility providers and healthcare workforce solution providers, among others. Over the years, this industry has strategically moved from volume- to value-based care. The resurgence in medical tourism is further boosting the sector. This changing pattern of care calls for advanced facilities, thus increasing the need to appoint specialized external service providers. With the growing importance of effective healthcare management, the medical service industry has become an integral part of the modern healthcare system. Story Continues 3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Medical Services Industry Digital Revolution: The adoption of digital platforms within the medical device space is gaining prominence in the United States. A 2024 digital health market report by Statista suggests that this market will witness a 9.2% CAGR from 2024 to 2028. The increasing availability of unstructured health data, advanced analytics, and the demand for personalized medical services underscores the growing importance of big data in healthcare. According to a Roots Analysis report, the global big data in healthcare market size is estimated to grow from $78 billion in 2024 to $540 billion by 2035, representing a CAGR of 19.20%. Other reports suggest that companies that adopted artificial intelligence technologies witnessed a 50% reduction in treatment costs and experienced more than 50% improvement in patient outcomes. Revival in the Nursing Care Market : In 2025, the role of nurses continues to evolve with advancements in medical technologies and shifts in healthcare delivery models. Telehealth and remote patient monitoring have expanded nurses' reach beyond traditional hospital settings, enabling them to provide care in rural or underserved areas. Specialized nursing roles, such as nurse practitioners, critical care specialists and geriatric nurses, are in high demand due to the growing complexity of patient needs. Going by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the overall employment of nurse anesthetists, nurse midwives and nurse practitioners is projected to grow 40% from 2023 to 2033, much faster than the average for all occupations. About 31,900 openings for nurse anesthetists, nurse midwives, and nurse practitioners are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Staffing Shortage : Despite the end of the healthcare emergency (WHO declared the end of COVID-19 as a global health emergency on May 5), the trauma of the past few years\u2019 uncertainty and commotion has forced frontline workers like doctors and medical staff to leave the field. Added to this, a drastic increase in the aging population in recent times (about 10,000 individuals aged 59-77 are joining Medicare plans daily) has made the healthcare staffing shortage more pronounced. In the article \"A Public Health Crisis: Staffing Shortages in Health Care,\" published in Favorite Healthcare Staffing, WHO predicts a shortfall of 15 million healthcare workers worldwide in 2030. Needless to say, this supply shortage has led to a significant rise in healthcare wages. Going by a HR for Health report,\u00a0 increased labor costs and staffing challenges have led to a rise in hospital expenses. Hospitals have experienced a 15.6% increase in labor expenses per adjusted discharge compared to pre-pandemic levels.

Needless to mention, value investment is gaining popularity day by day. However, this apparently simple-to-understand investing strategy has historically shown dangerous outcomes a number of times because of people's oversight of its basics. Warren Buffet, the popular value investor, believes that proper understanding of the \"intrinsic value\" of a stock may ease out many problems in this respect. According to him, going by the fundamentals of value investing, as we pick stocks which the market is currently undervaluing, we also need to focus on the earnings growth potential of a stock. Several stocks that have surged significantly in the recent past have shown the overwhelming success of this pure-play investment strategy. Here, we discuss four such stocks \u2014 The Gap Inc. , Embecta Corp. , Blue Bird and ZIM Integrated Shipping Services . More on Value Investing However, this simple value investment technique has some drawbacks, and not properly understanding the strategy may often lead to \"value traps.\" In such a situation, these value picks start to underperform over the long run when the temporary problems, which once drove the share price down, turn out to be persistent. There are many value investment yardsticks, such as dividend yield, P/E or P/B, which are simple and can single out whether a stock is trading at a discount. However, for investors looking to escape such value traps, it is also vital to determine where the stock will be headed in the next 12 to 24 months. Warren Buffett advises these investors to focus on the earnings growth potential of a stock. This is where the importance of a not-so-popular value investing metric, the PEG ratio, lies. PEG Ratio at a Glance The PEG ratio is defined as (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth Rate A low PEG ratio is always better for value investors. While P/E alone fails to identify a true value stock, PEG helps find the intrinsic value of a stock. There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio. It does not consider the common situation of changing growth rates, such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate, followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate over the long term.

{"text": "4 Best-Bargain PEG Stocks That Value Investors Love Urmimala Biswas Mon, Dec 23, 2024, 4:47 PM 5 min read In This Article: BLBD -2.50% With the market getting increasingly fickle on external shocks, investors are more focused on finding an investment strategy that emphasizes judging a stock's inherent potential. Needless to mention, value investment is gaining popularity day by day.\u00a0 However, this apparently simple-to-understand investing strategy has historically shown dangerous outcomes a number of times because of people\u2019s oversight of its basics. Warren Buffet, the popular value investor, believes that proper understanding of the \u201cintrinsic value\u201d of a stock may ease out many problems in this respect. According to him, going by the fundamentals of value investing, as we pick stocks which the market is currently undervaluing, we also need to focus on the earnings growth potential of a stock. Several stocks that have surged significantly in the recent past have shown the overwhelming success of this pure-play investment strategy. Here, we discuss four such stocks \u2014 The Gap Inc. GAP, Embecta Corp. EMBC, Blue Bird BLBD and ZIM Integrated Shipping Services ZIM. More on Value Investing However, this simple value investment technique has some drawbacks, and not properly understanding the strategy may often lead to \u201cvalue traps.\u201d In such a situation, these value picks start to underperform over the long run when the temporary problems, which once drove the share price down, turn out to be persistent. There are many value investment yardsticks, such as dividend yield, P/E or P/B, which are simple and can single out whether a stock is trading at a discount. However, for investors looking to escape such value traps, it is also vital to determine where the stock will be headed in the next 12 to 24 months. Warren Buffett advises these investors to focus on the earnings growth potential of a stock. This is where the importance of a not-so-popular value investing metric, the PEG ratio, lies. PEG Ratio at a Glance The PEG ratio is defined as (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth Rate A low PEG ratio is always better for value investors. While P/E alone fails to identify a true value stock, PEG helps find the intrinsic value of a stock. There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio. It does not consider the common situation of changing growth rates, such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate, followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate over the long term. Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration. Story Continues Here are some of the screening criteria for a winning strategy: PEG Ratio less than X Industry Median P/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (for more accurate valuation purposes) Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1\u00a0or 2 have a proven history of success.) Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us focus on companies that have strong liquidity.) Average 20-Day Volume greater than 50,000 (A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.) Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5% (Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.) Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold), offer the best upside potential. Our PEG-Driven Picks Here are four of the seven stocks that qualified the screening: Gap : With more than 3,600 stores worldwide, Gap is a premier international specialty retailer offering a diverse range of clothing, accessories, and personal care products.

{"text": "Here's Why You Should Add Ensign Group Stock to Your Portfolio Now Zacks Equity Research Thu, Dec 26, 2024, 8:56 PM 4 min read In This Article: ENSG +1.98% The Ensign Group, Inc. ENSG is benefiting from strategic acquisitions, an expanding footprint, rising service revenues and a strong financial position. An optimistic 2024 business outlook also reinforces investors\u2019 confidence in the stock. Zacks Rank & Price Performance Ensign Group carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. The stock has gained 11.5% in the past six months compared with the\u00a0industry\u2019s 2.9% growth. The\u00a0Medical\u00a0sector and the S&P 500 Composite have declined 9.7% and increased 10.3%, respectively, in the same time frame. ENSG's 6-Month Price Performance Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Rising Estimates The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ensign Group\u2019s 2024 earnings is pegged at $5.49 per share, indicating an improvement of 15.1% from the year-earlier reading, while the same for revenues is $4.3 billion, implying a 14% increase from the prior-year actual. The consensus mark for 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.07 per share, indicating 10.7% growth from the 2024 estimate. The same for revenues stands at $4.7 billion, which indicates a rise of 11% from the 2024 estimate. ENSG\u2019s earnings outpaced estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 1.3%. Key Drivers Ensign Group's revenue growth is primarily fueled by rising service revenues from its advanced healthcare offerings at skilled nursing, rehabilitation, and senior living facilities. The aging U.S. population is expected to sustain the robust demand for ENSG's senior living services. Additionally, the growing need for effective rehabilitation services, which assist individuals in resuming daily activities, is projected to drive revenue growth in the company's Skilled Services segment. ENSG anticipates revenues within the range of $4.25-$4.26 billion in 2024, the midpoint of which indicates 14.1% growth from the 2023 reported figure.\u00a0Adjusted earnings per share are estimated to lie between $5.46 and $5.52 this year. The midpoint of the outlook indicates 15.1% growth from the 2023 reported figure. The strong performance of Ensign Group's Standard Bearer segment further boosts revenue. Through the Standard Bearer unit, the company generates rental income by leasing post-acute care properties, which it owns, to healthcare operators under triple-net lease agreements. These arrangements benefit Ensign Group by not only providing rental revenues but also shifting property-related expenses to the tenants. Ensign Group\u2019s growth strategy, which is focused on acquisitions, is noteworthy. The company actively acquires facilities in various U.S. regions, fostering collaborations with local caregiving teams. This localized approach enables Ensign Group to understand regional healthcare needs better and deliver high-quality services to underserved communities. Story Continues In December 2024, ENSG expanded its portfolio by acquiring eight healthcare facilities in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and California. These strategic acquisitions enhance Ensign Group's healthcare portfolio and national footprint. Currently, the company operates 330 healthcare facilities across 16 states and owns 134 real estate assets. Acquisitions remain a top priority for management in its capital allocation strategy. To sustain its ongoing investments, maintaining a strong financial foundation is crucial. Ensign Group benefits from substantial cash reserves and adequate cash generation abilities. These financial strengths also support shareholder returns through share buybacks and dividends. The company has consistently increased its dividend payments for 22 consecutive years, demonstrating a commitment to rewarding shareholders. ENSG\u2019s board of directors recently approved a 4.2% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to boost shareholders' value.

{"text": "Is It Time To Consider Buying Embecta Corp. (NASDAQ:EMBC)? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Fri, Nov 29, 2024, 3:31 PM 3 min read In This Article: EMBC +0.11% While Embecta Corp. ( NASDAQ:EMBC ) might not have the largest market cap around , it saw a significant share price rise of 65% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. The recent jump in the share price has meant that the company is trading at close to its 52-week high. As a stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let\u2019s take a look at Embecta\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Embecta Is Embecta Still Cheap? Great news for investors \u2013 Embecta is still trading at a fairly cheap price. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $30.02, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Embecta\u2019s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its true value, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it\u2019s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range. What kind of growth will Embecta generate? NasdaqGS:EMBC Earnings and Revenue Growth November 29th 2024 Future outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Embecta's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 27%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value. What This Means For You Are you a shareholder? Since EMBC is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation. Are you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on EMBC for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy EMBC. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision. Story Continues So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Embecta at this point in time.

Mover Embecta Corp. (EMBC) Zacks Equity Research Mon, Dec 9, 2024, 4:50 PM 4 min read In This Article: EMBC +0.11% Momentum investors typically don't time the market or \"buy low and sell high.\" In other words, they avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that \"buying high and selling higher\" is the way to make far more money in lesser time. Everyone likes betting on fast-moving trending stocks, but it isn't easy to determine the right entry point. These stocks often lose momentum when their future growth potential fails to justify their swelled-up valuation. In that phase, investors find themselves invested in shares that have limited to no upside or even a downside. So, betting on a stock just by looking at the traditional momentum parameters could be risky at times. A safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced. Embecta Corp. (EMBC) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones: Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 23.8% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this company well in this regard. While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. EMBC meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 20.1% over the past 12 weeks. Moreover, the momentum for EMBC is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.24. This indicates that the stock moves 24% higher than the market in either direction. Given this price performance, it is no surprise that EMBC has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success. In addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped EMBC earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> Story Continues Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, EMBC is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. EMBC is currently trading at 0.99 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 99 cents for each dollar of sales. So, EMBC appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace. In addition to EMBC, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria. This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market. However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

Reports Fiscal 2024 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Financial Results; Provides Initial Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Guidance; Discontinues Insulin Patch Pump Program; and Announces Restructuring to Streamline Operations and Reduce Costs Embecta Corp. Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 2:30 PM 32 min read In This Article: EMBC +0.11% Embecta Corp. PARSIPPANY, N.J., Nov. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Embecta Corp. (\u201cembecta\u201d or the \"Company\") (Nasdaq: EMBC), a global diabetes care company, today reported financial results for the three- and twelve-month periods ended September\u00a030, 2024. \"We are pleased to report a strong fourth quarter and end to our fiscal year, as we once again delivered results that exceeded our expectations across key financial metrics. We continued to execute on our strategic priorities, and to date, our significant accomplishments include the successful transition of approximately 98% of our revenue to our own ERP system, shared service capabilities, and distribution infrastructure, with India remaining as our only deferred market. Additionally, the recent launch of our small-pack GLP-1 needles in Germany has gone well, and we are evaluating expanding into other markets,\" said Devdatt (Dev) Kurdikar, Chief Executive Officer of embecta. Mr. Kurdikar continued: \"As our stand-up work nears completion and following an in-depth review of our portfolio and strategy, we have decided to discontinue our insulin patch pump program and initiate an organizational restructuring plan. We believe this approach will streamline operations, reduce costs and enhance our profitability and free cash flow profile. We intend to concentrate our resources on our core business and to prioritize our free cash flow towards paying down debt which we expect will give us the financial flexibility needed for future investments.\" The Company currently expects to incur total pre-tax charges of between $35 million and $45 million in fiscal year 2025 related to the restructuring plan, consisting of between $25 million and $30 million in pre-tax, cash charges for planned workforce reductions and other associated costs from the discontinuation of the patch pump program, and between $10 million and $15 million in pre-tax, non-cash charges for asset impairments and write-offs. Note, these preliminary estimates may be revised following the completion of the ongoing analysis of the expected additional pre-tax non-cash charges associated with the implementation of the restructuring plan. The Company expects the restructuring plan to be substantially complete during the first half of fiscal year 2025 and expects the discontinuation of the patch pump program and organizational restructuring plan to generate annualized pre-tax cost savings of between $60 million and $65 million. Given the organizational restructuring plan, the Company has decided to postpone the previously announced Analyst & Investor Day to Spring 2025.

The impact of changes in foreign currency may vary significantly from period to period, and such changes generally are outside of the control of our management. We believe that this measure facilitates a comparison of our operating performance exclusive of currency exchange rate fluctuations that do not reflect our underlying performance or business trends. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on an Adjusted constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.

Our revenues increased by $4.2 million, or 1.5%, to $286.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to revenues of $281.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Changes in our revenues are driven by the volume of goods that we sell, the prices we negotiate with customers and changes in foreign exchange rates. The increase in revenues was driven by $13.7 associated with favorable changes in price and a $2.3 increase in contract manufacturing revenues related to sales of non-diabetes products to BD. This was partially offset by $5.3 million of unfavorable gross-to-net adjustments primarily attributed to the recognition of incremental Italian payback accruals resulting from the two July 22, 2024 rulings by the Constitutional Court of Italy, $3.4 million associated with the negative impact of foreign currency translation primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, and $3.1 million of unfavorable changes in volume.

In 2024, Other reflects the recognition of incremental Italian payback accruals resulting from the two July 22, 2024 rulings by the Constitutional Court of Italy relating to certain prior years since 2015 in order to arrive at Adjusted Revenues. Our revenues increased by $2.3\u00a0million, or 0.2%, to $1,123.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2024 as compared to revenues of $1,120.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenues was primarily driven by $27.7 million associated with favorable changes in price. This was partially offset by $14.5 million of unfavorable changes in volume, $6.1 million associated with the negative impact of foreign currency translation primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, $4.6 million of unfavorable gross-to-net adjustments primarily attributed to the recognition of incremental Italian payback accruals resulting from the two July 22, 2024 rulings by the Constitutional Court of Italy, and a $0.2 million decrease in contract manufacturing revenues related to sales of non-diabetes products to BD. Preliminary Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Guidance: For fiscal year 2025, excluding the patch pump program, the Company expects: Dollars in millions, except percentages and per share data Reported Revenues $1,093 - $1,110 Reported Revenue Growth (%) (2.7)% - (1.2)% Impact of F/X (%) (0.6 )% Impact of Italian Payback Measure (1) (%) 0.4 % Adjusted Constant Currency Revenue Growth (%) (2.5)% - (1.0)% Adjusted Gross Margin (%) 63.25% - 64.25% Adjusted Operating Margin (%) 29.00% - 30.00% Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share $2.70 - $2.90 Adjusted EBITDA Margin (%) 35.50% - 36.50% (1) Reflects the recognition of incremental Italian payback accruals resulting from the two July 22, 2024 rulings by the Constitutional Court of Italy relating to certain prior years since 2015 recorded in Revenues. We are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of our expected adjusted earnings per diluted share, expected adjusted EBITDA and our expected adjusted EBITDA margin as we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty and without unreasonable effort the impact and timing of any one-time items. The financial impact of these one-time items is uncertain and is dependent on various factors, including timing, and could be material to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

These non-GAAP financial measures are indicators of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. They are presented with the intent of providing greater transparency to financial information used by us in our financial analysis and operational decision-making. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors, stockholders and other readers of our consolidated financial statements in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing the underlying performance of our results of operations. However, the presentation of these measures has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for the company\u2019s results as reported under GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the presentations of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures in its operational and financial decision making, and believes that it is useful to exclude certain items in order to focus on what it regards to be a meaningful alternative representation of the underlying operating performance of the business.

Safe Harbor Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains express or implied \"forward-looking statements\" as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other securities laws. These forward-looking statements concern our current expectations regarding our future results from operations, performance, financial condition, goals, strategies, plans and achievements. These forward-looking statements are subject to various known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, and you should not rely upon them except as statements of our present intentions and of our present expectations, which may or may not occur. When we use words such as \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"estimates,\" \"plans,\" \"intends\", \u201cpursue\u201d, \u201cwill\u201d, \u201cmay\u201d or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking statements. For example, embecta is using forward-looking statements when it discusses its plans to discontinue its patch pump program, concentrate its resources on its core business, prioritize free cash flow towards paying down debt, and create financial flexibility for future investments, its ability to reduce costs, streamline operations and enhance profitability, its expected savings and expenses from its organizational restructuring and the timing thereof, its fiscal 2025 financial guidance and its expectations with respect to strengthening its base business, separating and standing up embecta as an independent company, and investing in growth, and geographic expansion of new product pacts for non-insulin diabetes drugs. Although we believe that our forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, our expected results may not be achieved, and actual results may differ materially from our expectations. In addition, important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, among others: (i) competitive factors that could adversely affect embecta\u2019s operations; (ii) any inability to extend or replace the services provided by BD under the transaction documents; (iii) any failure by BD to perform its obligations under the various separation agreements entered into in connection with the separation and distribution; (iv) any events that adversely affect the sale or profitability of embecta\u2019s products or the revenues delivered from sales to its customers; (v) increases in operating costs, including fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials or components used in its products, the ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships, and the potential adverse effects of any disruption in the availability of such items; (vi) changes in reimbursement practices of governments or private payers or other cost containment measures; (vii) the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as regional, national and foreign economic factors, including inflation, deflation, and fluctuations in interest rates; (viii) the impact of changes in U.S. federal laws and policy that could affect fiscal and tax policies, healthcare and international trade, including import and export regulation and international trade agreements; (ix) any new pandemic, or any geopolitical instability, including disruptions in its operations and supply chains; (x) new or changing laws and regulations, or changes in enforcement practices, including laws relating to healthcare, environmental protection, trade, monetary and fiscal policies, taxation and licensing and regulatory requirements for products; (xi) the expected benefits of the separation from BD; (xii) risks associated with embecta\u2019s indebtedness; (xiii) the risk that ongoing dis-synergy costs, costs of restructuring and other costs incurred in connection with the separation from BD will exceed our estimates of these costs; (xiv) the risk that it will be more difficult than expected to effect embecta\u2019s full separation from BD; (xv) expectations related to the costs, profitability, timing and the estimated financial impact of, and charges and savings associated with, the restructuring plan we announced; (xvi) risks associated with not completing strategic collaborative partnerships and acquisitions for innovative technologies, complementary product lines, and new markets; and (xvii) the other risks described in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including under the caption \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as further updated by our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q we have filed or will file hereafter. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements appearing in this release.

A : Devdatt Kurdikar, CEO, noted that a very small portion of US revenue comes from products manufactured in China, and the company is prepared to capitalize on any opportunities arising from tariff changes. Jacob Elguicze, CFO, added that the 2025 tax rate is expected to increase due to Pillar Two and other factors, while FX is anticipated to be a headwind, impacting revenue and earnings per share. Q : Why did it take so long to decide to discontinue the patch pump program, given known challenges? A : Devdatt Kurdikar, CEO, explained that the decision was made after a market check post-FDA clearance revealed no viable options to monetize the asset. The evolving market dynamics and the need to allocate capital more effectively led to the decision to discontinue the program. Q : Are there any restrictions post-spin from BD that could affect new opportunities? A : Devdatt Kurdikar, CEO, stated that there are no restrictions on M&A opportunities. However, there are restrictions on using technology acquired at the point of separation. The focus is on creating financial flexibility to explore opportunities aligned with Embecta's core competencies. Q : Is there any residual value in the patch pump program that could be leveraged? A : Devdatt Kurdikar, CEO, mentioned that while the market check did not reveal viable options, the company remains open to discussions if interest arises in the future. The restructuring is focused on discontinuing the program, but potential interest in the asset or IP would be considered.
