(NASDAQ:ASNS) (\u201cActelis\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a market leader in cyber-hardened, rapid deployment networking solutions for IoT and broadband applications, today announced that it has secured a renewal of services order of a 6-figure US Dollar value from Kenton Group, a long-time partner, to provide continued support services for hybrid networking systems supplied to UK transport authorities. This order builds on Actelis\u2019 existing role in supporting critical transport infrastructure and positions the company to play a key role in future digital upgrades across the UK\u2019s transportation network. The ongoing support is in the modernization of the National Roads Telecommunications Service (NRTS), a vital digital infrastructure supporting England\u2019s Strategic Road Network (SRN). The NRTS connects over 36,000 services, enabling real-time monitoring and advanced traffic management. Actelis\u2019 hybrid fiber solutions deliver cost-effective, fiber-grade connectivity by leveraging existing infrastructure to support smart road technologies such as Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) and automated systems. \u201cWe are excited to continue supporting digital transformation initiatives in the UK,\u201d said Tuvia Barlev, Chairman and CEO of Actelis Networks. \u201cThis order reinforces the confidence in our cyber-hardened networking solutions and highlights our ability to deliver innovative, scalable technologies that improve safety and operational efficiency across vital transport systems. Looking ahead, we see this as a precursor to significant opportunities as the UK prepares for the anticipated next phase of the NRTS upgrade.\u201d The anticipated NRTS-3 phase is expected to further modernize the UK\u2019s transport network with advanced digital services. Actelis\u2019 hybrid fiber-copper solutions provide a unique advantage in these upgrades, enabling secure, high-speed connectivity over existing infrastructure without the need for extensive new deployments. As the UK government continues to invest in smart road technologies, Actelis is well-positioned to secure substantial new orders in the coming phases of the project.

Infrastructure Modernization Efforts Business Wire Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 6:23 PM 3 min read In This Article: ASNS NEW YORK, January 22, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Market News Alerts Reports: Actelis Networks (NASDAQ: ASNS), a company specializing in cyber-hardened hybrid-fiber networking solutions, has announced a six-figure order renewal ahead of the next phase of the UK\u2019s National Roads Telecommunications Service (NRTS). While specific terms of the deal were not disclosed, this order is part of ongoing efforts to modernize the digital infrastructure of England\u2019s Strategic Road Network (SRN) and may signal Actelis\u2019 potential future involvement in the program\u2019s next phases \u2013 which seem to be quite expansive. This could why Actelis says this order \"positions the company for major future opportunities\". What is the NRTS? The NRTS (National Roads Telecommunications Service) connects over 36,000 roadside services\u2014including traffic signals, CCTV cameras, and information systems\u2014across England\u2019s motorways and major roads. Designed to enable real-time traffic management and advanced applications like Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X), the network is a cornerstone of the UK\u2019s Digital Roads Strategy. Actelis\u2019 hybrid-fiber technology, which blends the performance of fiber with the cost-saving use of existing copper infrastructure, seems to be a good fit for such large-scale and complex deployments. Actelis History with NRTS This latest announcement seems to be part of an existing relationship and history Actelis\u2019 has when it comes to the NRTS. In a previously published case study that appears on Actelis\u2019 site, Actelis showcased how together with its then-partner Telent, they successfully delivered hybrid-fiber solutions during earlier phases of the program, overcoming challenges related to integrating new and legacy infrastructure. According to recent news articles, Telent, which has a history of collaborating with Actelis, was appointed to manage National Highways' Corporate Wide Area Network (WAN), further strengthening its position as a key partner in the UK's critical infrastructure modernization efforts. According to \u2018Highways News\u2019, this reflects their ongoing involvement with National Highways to transform the NRTS. What could involvement in the next phase of NRTS mean for Actelis? The anticipated next phase, NRTS-3, represents a massive opportunity within the UK\u2019s Digital Roads Strategy. With a reported budget of at least \u00a3650 million according to coverage of the UK Government Tender , the project seems to involve substantial investments in modernizing and expanding critical infrastructure, including connectivity for over 36,000 roadside devices across England\u2019s Strategic Road Network (SRN). While Actelis would likely be just one of many suppliers\u2014or even a supplier to another primary contractor like Telent\u2014the sheer scale and expense of such infrastructure projects offer considerable revenue potential for all involved. Story Continues Actelis\u2019 confidence in its potential role seems evident in CEO Tuvia Barlev\u2019s statement in the company\u2019s official announcement: \" We see this renewal as a precursor to significant opportunities as the UK prepares for the next phase of the NRTS upgrade.\" Notably, According to the UK Governement\u2019s site , back in 2017, Telent was already awarded a \u00a3450 million NRTS contract \u2013 which was its second contract for the project. Given Telent\u2019s history of securing the NRTS contract and its extension to 2027, and Actelis\u2019 existing relationship with Telent from previous phases of the program, this confidence may be well-founded. Actelis\u2019 hybrid-fiber solutions, which appear to have been integral in earlier phases, could make it a strong contender for continued involvement.

Actelis launches MetaShield as part of its unique Cyber Aware Networking strategy, marking a significant milestone for the company, enhancing its networking portfolio with advanced AI-based cybersecurity to protect edge devices from within the network itself FREMONT, Calif., Dec. 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Actelis Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:ASNS) (\u201cActelis\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a market leader in cyber-hardened, rapid deployment networking solutions for IoT and broadband applications, today announced the official launch of MetaShield, the company\u2019s highly anticipated Cyber Aware Networking product. This milestone represents a significant step forward in Actelis\u2019 strategy to expand its portfolio and establish a robust SaaS business model, delivering enhanced value to its customers, and an important differentiator for the Company\u2019s networking solutions. MetaShield is designed to address the growing need for proactive, integrated, cybersecurity and operational continuity management solutions within IoT and critical infrastructure networks. By applying advanced threat detection and response capabilities directly into the company\u2019s hybrid-fiber networking products, MetaShield offers deep continuous monitoring and real-time protection. Thus, Metashield enables the safeguarding of networks against operational failures as well as sophisticated cyber threats, particularly at the edge of the network where vulnerabilities are most pronounced and hardest to detect, and before bad actions can propagate throughout the network. Following Actelis\u2019 announcement in August, the Company has received strong industry feedback on MetaShield during its pre-launch phase. The company will now expand its sales activity to bring this innovative solution to market. MetaShield not only strengthens Actelis\u2019 position as a leader in secure networking but is also expected, over time, to expand its business model to include additional recurring revenue with healthy margins streams through its SaaS offering, and to differentiate its MetaShield-compatible networking solutions. \u201cThe official launch of MetaShield marks a transformative moment for Actelis Networks,\u201d said Tuvia Barlev, Chairman and CEO of Actelis. \u201cAs the world becomes more interconnected, the threats to critical infrastructure are growing more sophisticated. MetaShield is our response to these challenges, providing a comprehensive solution that combines robust cybersecurity with the performance and scalability of our hybrid-fiber networking technology. MetaShield operates from within the network, making it effective at the often vulnerable edge of the network, while also providing a seamless way for our critical infrastructure customers to protect their IoT operations naturally as the network is installed. This launch demonstrates our commitment to innovation and sets the stage for the next chapter of growth, enhancing the value we deliver to our customers while contributing to our long-term vision of establishing a strong SaaS business model.\u201d Story Continues MetaShield integrates seamlessly with Actelis\u2019 existing products, enabling rapid deployment without requiring extensive infrastructure changes. This capability is particularly vital for industries such as government, defense, transportation, and utilities, where both speed and security are paramount. The product\u2019s advanced features include real-time anomaly detection, AI-driven threat mitigation, and automated network responses, ensuring continuous operation even under the most challenging conditions.

Growth Reaching $6.7 Million Actelis Networks, Inc. Thu, Nov 14, 2024, 5:47 PM 16 min read In This Article: ASNS Actelis Networks, Inc. Strong revenue growth and a significant increase in gross margin from 34% to 58% for the nine months ending June 2024. Q3 2024 EBITDA loss narrowed to $0.2 million, reflecting ongoing momentum and successful cost reduction efforts FREMONT, Calif., Nov. 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Actelis Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASNS) (\u201cActelis\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a market leader in cyber-hardened, rapid deployment networking solutions for wide area IoT applications, today reported financial results for the fiscal third quarter ended September 30, 2024. Financial Highlights for the Third Quarter and nine months ending September 30: Robust Revenue Growth, Surpassing Full-Year 2023 in Nine Months: Revenue reached $2.54 million in Q3 2024, a 200% year-over-year increase from $0.85 million in Q3 2023. For the nine months ending September 30, 2024, revenue grew to $6.7 million\u2014up 46% from the prior-year period\u2014driven by accelerated execution of large contracts, including $1.1 million of software and support revenues out of a two-year software and services renewal with one of our largest customers. Significant Improvement in Gross Margin: Gross margin soared to $1.74 million, or 69%, in Q3 2024, a substantial increase from $0.2 million, or 27%, in the same quarter last year. This boost was driven by an increase in revenues driving lower indirect costs as a percentage of revenues, and the significant software component of revenue. For the nine months ending September 30, 2024, gross margin increased to $3.9 million, or 58%, up from $1.55 million, or 34%, in the prior-year period. This substantial improvement is driven by higher software and services revenue and other high margin sales, along with stable, low indirect costs. Continued Reduction in Operating Expenses: Operating expenses continued their downward trend, totaling $2.0 million in Q3-2024, a 12% reduction compared to the same quarter last year. For the nine months ending September 30, 2024, operating expenses reached $6.0 million, down 17%, or $1.22 million, from the prior-year period, aligning with the company\u2019s cost reduction commitment made last year. Significant Reduction in Net Loss and Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA: Net loss narrowed substantially to $511,000 in Q3 2024, a 41% decrease compared to the prior-year quarter, and by 41% to $2.57 million for the nine months ending September 30, 2024. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA improved sharply, down 87% to $233,000 in Q3 2024, and down 56% to $2.0 million for the nine-month period. These improvements reflect the successful impact of increased revenue, gross margin growth, and ongoing operating cost reductions. Liquidity and Nasdaq Compliance Secured: With nearly $5 million raised in June 2024 and a significant reduction in net loss, shareholders\u2019 equity reached $2.8 million as of September 30, 2024. In September, the Company also filed a shelf prospectus and now has an effective At-The-Market (ATM) facility in place. Story Continues \u201cOur third-quarter results underscore Actelis\u2019 strong financial performance and continued growth trajectory,\u201d said Tuvia Barlev, Chairman and CEO of Actelis. \u201cWith robust revenue growth, a dramatic increase in gross margins, and disciplined cost management, we are achieving the financial resilience needed to support our expanding role in critical sectors. This progress reflects the value of our cyber-hardened, rapid-deployment networking solutions and our commitment to driving sustainable long-term growth for our shareholders.\u201d Recent Company Highlights Actelis continues to gain strong traction with significant contract renewals and new orders across strategic markets. In Q3 2024, Actelis secured the 1.4 million renewal of a two-year software and services contract with one of its largest North American customers out of which recognized 1.1 million in Q3, underscoring the long-standing trust and value Actelis provides while further enhancing our recurring revenue base. The Company also received substantial new orders across diverse sectors, solidifying Actelis' position as a leading provider of cyber-hardened, rapid-deployment networking solutions. Key projects include modernization initiatives for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) in major U.S. cities and counties, deployments for U.S. military bases, and expansion into European markets like Italy\u2019s national highway infrastructure and German utilities. Recent follow-on orders with the U.S. Department of Transportation and municipalities in Germany demonstrate Actelis\u2019 capability to serve critical infrastructure, transportation, and government applications with its secure, hybrid-fiber technology. Actelis\u2019 expense reduction program continues to yield positive results, with operating expenses for the nine months ending June 30, 2024, reduced by 17% year-over-year, aligning with our strategic cost structure optimization plan, and preparing the Company for a strong trajectory towards 2025. Actelis continues to advance its \u2018Cyber Aware Networking\u2019 initiative, an AI-powered SaaS layer designed to enhance the security of IoT networks by providing comprehensive threat monitoring and automated response capabilities directly at the network edge. As part of this initiative, and as reported on August 19, 2024, the Company is collaborating with an advanced cybersecurity provider to further develop and deliver these capabilities. Following extensive due diligence, Actelis issued a termination notice on October 12, 2024, for its agreement with Quality Industrial Corp., concluding that the deal did not align with our objective to maximize shareholder value. Despite ongoing tensions and conflicts in the Middle East, Actelis\u2019 operations remain unaffected. We are closely monitoring the situation and are prepared to make necessary adjustments as events unfold. \u201cOur third quarter concluded positively, meeting and exceeding key expectations,\u201d noted Tuvia Barlev, Chairman and CEO of Actelis. \u201cOur unique ability to deliver fiber-grade hardware, software, and services across key verticals\u2014such as Intelligent Transportation, Smart Cities, Federal and Military agencies, and Multi-Dwelling Units\u2014positions us well to maximize revenue growth and advance towards profitability. Looking ahead, we remain focused on driving organic growth while also exploring strategic opportunities that align with our strengths and enhance the value we bring to our customers.\u201d Fiscal Third Quarter and First nine months 2024 Financial Results: Revenues: Q3 2024 revenues were $2.54 million, reflecting a 200% year-over-year increase from $0.85 million in Q3 2023. The increase from the corresponding period was primarily attributable to an increase of $1.4 million of revenues generated from North America driven by volume increase and a renewal of a service and software contract and an increase of $0.3 million of revenues generated from Asia Pacific and Europe, the Middle East and Africa driven by volume increase. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues were $6.7 million, compared to $4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase from the corresponding period was primarily attributable to an increase of $3.4 million in revenues generated from North America associated with volume increase and a renewal of a service and software contract offset by decrease of $1.3 million in revenues generated from Asia Pacific and Europe, the Middle East and Africa associated with completed projects in the prior year period. Cost of Revenues: Cost of revenues for Q3 2024 was $0.8 million, compared to $0.6 million in Q3 2023. The increase from the corresponding period was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues as well as change in the product mix. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the cost of revenues was $2.8 million, compared to $3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease from the corresponding period was primarily attributable to the change in regional mix of revenue of an increase in North America revenues, which are more profitable, and a decrease in Europe, Middle East and Africa revenues which are less profitable Gross Profit: Gross profit for Q3 2024 was $1.7 million, up from $0.23 in Q3 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit reached $3.9 million, compared to $1.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Research and Development Expenses: R&D expenses for Q3 2024 were $0.5, down from $0.7 in Q3 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, R&D expenses were $1.8 million, compared to $2.1 million in the same period last year. The decrease is primarily attributable to cost reduction measures taken. Sales and Marketing Expenses: Sales and marketing expenses for Q3 2024 were $0.72, compared to $0.69 in Q3 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these expenses totaled $2.0 million, down from $2.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.The decrease was mainly due to cost reduction measures taken. General and Administrative Expenses: G&A expenses were $0.79 in Q3 2024, down from $0.97 in Q3 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, G&A expenses were $2.4 million, compared to $2.80 million for the same period last year. The decrease was mainly due to cost reduction measures taken. Other Income: Other Income was $0 in Q3 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Other Income was $163,000 driven by a government grant from the state of Israel associated with the Swords of Iron war. Operating Profit/Loss: Operating profit for Q3 2024 was $0.32 million, compared to an operating loss of $2.13 million in Q3 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the operating loss was reduced to $2.12 million, down from $5.70 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly due to the increase in revenues, improved gross margin due to regional revenue mix, and cost reduction measures taken, reducing operating expenses. Financial Income/(expense) and Interest Expenses: Our financial income, net was $52,000 and our interest expense was $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to financial income, net of $1.4 million and $0.2 million interest expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is mainly due to financial income in the prior year from bank deposits and exchange rate differences not repeated in current period. Our financial income, net was $138,000 and our interest expense was $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to financial income, net of $1.9 million and interest expense of $0.5 million interest expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is mainly due to financial income in the prior year from bank deposits and exchange rate differences not repeated in current period. Net Comprehensive Profit/(Loss): Net comprehensive Loss for Q3 2024 was $0.51 million, a significant turnaround from a net loss of $0.87 million in Q3 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net loss was $2.57 million, compared to a net loss of $4.35 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the increase in revenues, improved gross margin due to regional revenue mix, and cost reduction measures taken, reducing operating expenses, partially offset by financial income in the prior year not repeating itself. Non-GAAP EBITDA : Non-GAAP EBITDA loss was $233,000 in Q3-2024, compared to a non-GAAP EBITDA loss of $1.76 million in the year ago period, driven by increased revenue, better gross margin and reduced operating expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-GAAP EBITDA loss was $2.0 million, from $4.6 million in the year ago period. This decrease was primarily due to the increase in revenues, improved gross margin due to regional revenue mix, and cost reduction measures taken, reducing operating expenses.

GigaLine 900 Showcased Across Europe and U.S., Offers Rapid, Scalable Deployment with Unmatched Power Efficiency for Expanding High-Speed Connectivity in Multi-Dwelling-Units over existing wires or coax FREMONT, Calif., Nov. 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Actelis Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:ASNS) (\u201cActelis\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a market leader in cyber-hardened, rapid deployment hybrid networking, recently showcased its GigaLine 900 (GL900) broadband solution at multiple industry events such as WISPAPALOOZA, Broadband Communities West Summit, Connected Britain, and Connected Germany, attracting much interest from providers, integrators and building owners. This attention has underscored the GL900\u2019s potential as an ultra-low power, highly cost-effective solution designed to deliver symmetrical Gigabit services, within multi-dwelling units (MDUs), without the need to run new wires or Fiber in the walls, setting it apart with its unique sub-5W power consumption. The GL900\u2019s ultra-low power consumption, at less than 5W, enables broadband providers to meet the needs of millions of residents in MDUs efficiently and sustainably. With 23 million apartment buildings in the U.S. alone, this scalable solution is positioned to provide fiber-grade connectivity without the high costs and logistical challenges of rewiring\u2014a critical feature in closing the digital divide for American families. By leveraging existing copper or coax wiring, the GL900 offers flexible, fiber-grade performance that can adapt to varying building sizes, providing service to numerous apartments per unit and reducing both deployment time and energy consumption. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled with the market\u2019s reception to our GL900,\u201d said Tuvia Barlev, Chairman and CEO of Actelis. \u201cVisitors to our booths recognized the GL900\u2019s ability to address the industry's need for scalable, low-cost, and sustainable broadband solutions for MDUs, a key market we are well-positioned to serve. We have already received initial customer orders and multiple trials are underway.\u201d Actelis\u2019 unique technology allows wireless operators, such as those attending WISPAPALOOZA, to extend connectivity from rooftop access points directly into individual apartments, enhancing last-mile delivery in complex building infrastructures. With approximately 23 million apartment buildings in the United States, the majority of which were built before the year 2000, the GL900\u2019s rapid deployment capability, achieving Gigabit performance in less than an hour, meets the critical need for efficient broadband solutions in this significant segment. This solution aligns with current infrastructure initiatives like the $42 billion BEAD program , enabling broadband providers to maximize government funding by expanding access quickly and affordably. Story Continues \u201cAcross these shows, we\u2019ve heard consistently that the GL900 fills a crucial gap, but awareness of Actelis and our unique capabilities is essential for broader adoption,\u201d added Bret Harrison, SVP Sales America at Actelis. \u201cWith the GL900, operators can easily and efficiently bridge the connectivity gap, even in challenging MDU environments.\u201d About Actelis Networks, Inc.
