(NASDAQ: PRAX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company translating genetic insights into the development of therapies for central nervous system (CNS) disorders characterized by neuronal excitation-inhibition imbalance, today highlighted its portfolio progress and provided its business priorities for 2025. \u201c2024 was a landmark year for Praxis with positive topline results from the Phase 2 photoparoxysmal response (PPR) trial of vormatrigine that led to initiating our ENERGY program in common epilepsies. Additional highlights this year were the unprecedented efficacy in cohort 1 of the EMBOLD study of relutrigine in developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), followed by the initiation of the registrational cohort 2, and the continued overwhelming interest in the Essential3 program. Together, this progress has led to three blockbuster programs in late stage, with the potential for four product launches between 2026 and 2028,\u201d said Marcio Souza, president and chief executive officer. Mr. Souza continued, \u201cWe are now well positioned for a readout-rich 2025, with results anticipated for ulixacaltamide in the Essential3 program in ET followed by our first NDA filing, as well as topline results for vormatrigine from the RADIANT study in focal onset seizures (FOS) and generalized epilepsy, and the POWER1 study in FOS. We are also thrilled to have received a third rare pediatric drug designation (RPDD) for relutrigine in Dravet Syndrome, and with strong interest in cohort 2 of the EMBOLD study, we expect to file the NDA in 2026. With regulatory feedback on the elsunersen program, we expect to initiate the pivotal trial in the first half of 2025. We are sufficiently funded to advance all programs through their topline readouts, with runway into 2028. We look forward to providing a thorough update across our portfolio at the planned Investor R&D Day in the second quarter of 2025.\u201d Story Continues Portfolio updates and anticipated milestones Cerebrum\u2122 Small Molecule Platform Ulixacaltamide for Essential Tremor ET is an inadequately managed, undertreated and high burden disease with a prevalence of seven million patients in the U.S. The Essential3 program includes two Phase 3, registrational studies: Study 1 is a parallel design, placebo-controlled study (N=400) and Study 2 is a randomized withdrawal study (N=200). Since beginning recruitment in November 2023, over 100,000 patients have demonstrated interest in participating in the study. A pre-planned interim analysis of Study 1 is anticipated in the first quarter of 2025. At the time of the interim analysis update, Praxis will provide further detail on timing for the full readouts of Study 1 and Study 2. Praxis anticipates filing the NDA for ulixacaltamide in 2025. Following positive results from Essential3, the Company plans to re-initiate a study of ulixacaltamide in Parkinson\u2019s disease, where there is significant and unmet need for non-dopaminergic treatment options. Vormatrigine (PRAX-628) for Common Epilepsies (Focal Onset Seizures and Generalized Epilepsy) An estimated 3.5 million people in the U.S. suffer from common epilepsies. Sodium channel therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for patients with epilepsy yet currently approved drugs have significant safety and efficacy limitations. Vormatrigine is the most potent sodium-channel modulator ever designed to precisely target the hyperexcitable state of sodium-channels in adult common epilepsies. In recently completed Phase 1 studies, vormatrigine continued to demonstrate an ideal profile with strong competitive differentiation. Full results will be shared at an upcoming medical conference and highlights include: Results from an additional 45 mg multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohort showed a dose proportional increase in exposure with excellent tolerability, similar to the 20 and 30 mg MAD cohorts completed previously. A Phase 1 food effect study demonstrated that food intake does not affect vormatrigine absorption and therefore there is no need to take vormatrigine with food, which increases flexibility in dosing and ease of use. Praxis continues to make progress on the ENERGY program to advance vormatrigine through efficacy and registrational trials. The EMPOWER observational study , in partnership with the Epilepsy Study Consortium, is aiming to better characterize seizure burden started enrolling patients in 2024 and has enrolled over 2,000 patients. Early results were shared during the Praxis scientific exhibit at the December 2024 American Epilepsy Society (AES) Annual Meeting. The RADIANT Phase 2 study for FOS and generalized epilepsy is currently enrolling patients, with topline results expected in the first half of 2025. RADIANT is an open-label study recruiting up to 50 patients with FOS or generalized epilepsy, who will be treated with a 30 mg dose over an 8-week period to evaluate the impact of vormatrigine on seizure burden. Enrollment for the POWER1 Phase 2/3 registrational study in patients with treatment resistant FOS is progressing as planned, with topline results anticipated in the second half of 2025. POWER1 is assessing adjunctive treatment, allowing dosing of vormatrigine on top of 1 to 3 antiseizure medications (ASMs), and aims to enroll approximately 250 patients in a parallel-arm study, comparing a treatment arm of 20 mg for 6 weeks followed by 30 mg for 6 weeks versus a placebo arm for 12 weeks. POWER2 will be the second registrational study for vormatrigine and is expected to begin enrollment in the second half of 2025 as a three-arm, 12-week study. Praxis continues to evaluate the potential for expansion of one of its highly functionally selective compounds into pain indications. The program will be discussed at Praxis\u2019 planned R&D Day in the second quarter of 2025. Relutrigine (PRAX-562) for Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies DEEs cover a wide range of genetically and phenotypically defined epileptic conditions that are often characterized by onset of seizures at or shortly after birth and occur in approximately 200,000 patients in the U.S. Relutrigine is a sodium channel modulator with therapeutic potential across developmental epilepsies. Relutrigine is currently being evaluated in the EMBOLD study in SCN2A and SCN8A DEEs, with future plans for the EMERALD study in a broader, pan-DEE patient population. In cohort 1 of the EMBOLD study assessing relutrigine versus placebo in SCN2A gain-of-function (GoF) and SCN8A patients, relutrigine showed unparalleled results , with an update on the open-label extension (OLE) shared at the 2024 AES Annual Meeting . Key results included: 46% placebo-adjusted reduction in monthly motor seizures from baseline over a 16-week period. Patients continuing into the ongoing OLE (n=13) saw a 77% reduction in motor seizures from baseline through nine months of treatment. Over 30% of patients (n=5) achieved seizure freedom status while on relutrigine. Patients achieving seizure freedom had a median of 46 days of seizure freedom, inclusive of OLE period, compared to 3 days at baseline. Meaningful gains observed in alertness, communication and seizure severity suggest relutrigine has a disease modifying effect. Relutrigine was generally well-tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events or dose reductions required. EMBOLD is currently enrolling 80 patients with SCN2A and SCN8A DEEs in registrational cohort 2, with topline results anticipated in the first half of 2026, to be followed by an NDA filing later in 2026. In December 2024, Praxis received RPDD for relutrigine for Dravet Syndrome. This is the third RPDD for relutrigine, in addition to SCN2A and SCN8A DEEs. Praxis remains on track to initiate the EMERALD registrational study in the first half of 2025. At the 2024 AES Annual Meeting, Praxis shared an update for an emergency use patient with extended benefit achieved after receiving relutrigine Solidus\u2122 Antisense Oligonucleotide (ASO) Platform Elsunersen (PRAX-222) for early-seizure-onset SCN2A-DEE SCN2A GoF-DEE is a rare, genetic epilepsy characterized by early-onset and severe impact on development. The disease, as with all DEEs, affects not only the patient but also the entire caregiver ecosystem. In a Part 1 analysis of the EMBRAVE study, four patients receiving elsunersen over a four-month period achieved a 43% reduction in seizure burden compared to baseline. Praxis has completed discussions with global regulatory agencies to harmonize a registrational study design for elsunersen and will share the trial design and expected timelines in the first quarter of 2025. The second cohort of the EMBRAVE study continues to enroll patients in Brazil, evaluating safety and efficacy of elsunersen versus sham procedure. At the 2024 AES Annual Meeting, Praxis shared an update on four emergency access patient s , including updates from the first-in-patient case who has received elsunersen for over 15 months. Additional Pipeline Updates In December 2024, UCB exercised its option to in-license global development and commercialization rights for a KCNT1 small molecule development candidate as part of the strategic research collaboration established in December 2022. Praxis has earned an option exercise fee and is eligible to receive future success-based development and commercialization milestone payments, for a total of up to approximately $100 million, in addition to tiered royalties on net sales of any resulting products from the collaboration. Praxis remains on track to nominate a development candidate for each of its early stage ASO therapeutic initiatives in 2025 PRAX-080: Focused on targeting PCDH19 mosaic expression which represents a pioneering approach to treating PCDH19-related epilepsy, a rare but devastating genetic disorder characterized by early-onset seizures and cognitive impairment, disproportionately affecting females.

About Ulixacaltamide Ulixacaltamide is a differentiated and highly selective small molecule inhibitor of T-type calcium channels designed to block abnormal neuronal burst firing in the Cerebello-Thalamo-Cortical (CTC) circuit correlated with tremor activity. Ulixacaltamide, the most advanced program within Praxis\u2019 Cerebrum\u2122 small molecule platform, is currently in late-stage development for the treatment of essential tremor, Essential3 study . About Vormatrigine (PRAX-628) Vormatrigine is a next-generation, functionally selective small molecule targeting the hyperexcitable state of sodium-channels in the brain that is currently being developed as a once daily, oral treatment for adult focal onset seizures and generalized epilepsy. Preclinical data demonstrates vormatrigine is differentiated from standard of care, with the potential to be best-in-class for focal epilepsy. In vitro, vormatrigine has demonstrated superior selectivity for disease-state Na V channel hyperexcitability. In vivo studies of vormatrigine have demonstrated unprecedented potency in the maximal electroshock seizure (MES) model, a highly predictive translational model for efficacy in focal epilepsy. Data from the study demonstrated that vormatrigine can be safely dosed in healthy subjects to greater than 15 times the predicted human equivalent of the rodent MES EC 50 . To learn more about the POWER1 study please visit POWER1 study . About Relutrigine (PRAX-562) Relutrigine is a first-in-class small molecule in development for the treatment of developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) as a preferential inhibitor of persistent sodium current, shown to be a key driver of seizure symptoms in early onset SCN2A-DEE and SCN8A-DEE. Relutrigine\u2019s mechanism of sodium channel blocking is consistent with superior selectivity for disease state sodium channel (NaV) channel hyperexcitability. In vivo studies of relutrigine have demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of seizures up to complete control of seizure activity in SCN2A, SCN8A and other DEE mouse models. Relutrigine has been generally well-tolerated in three Phase 1 studies and has demonstrated biomarker changes indicative of NaV channel blocking effects. Relutrigine has received ODD and RPDD from the FDA, and ODD from the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of SCN2A-DEE and SCN8A-DEE and RPDD for Dravet Syndrome from the FDA.\u00a0To learn more about the EMBOLD study, please visit EMBOLD study . About Elsunersen (PRAX-222) Elsunersen is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) designed to selectively decrease SCN2A gene expression, directly targeting the underlying cause of early-seizure-onset SCN2A-DEE to treat seizures and other symptoms in patients with gain-of-function SCN2A mutations. In vitro studies of elsunersen have demonstrated reduction in both SCN2A gene expression and protein levels. In vivo, elsunersen has demonstrated significant, dose-dependent reduction in seizures, improvement in behavioral and locomotor activity and increased survival in SCN2A mouse models, with potential to be the first disease-modifying treatment for SCN2A-DEE. Elsunersen has received ODD and RPD from the FDA, and ODD and PRIME designations from the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of SCN2A-DEE. The Elsunersen program is ongoing under a collaboration with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

I Diversify With JEPI And EOI?!' Paula Tudoran Sun, Dec 29, 2024, 4:00 PM 5 min read In This Article: RDDT +1.38% Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Many investors struggle to counterbalance high yields against long-term stability when acquiring stable, reliable monthly revenue. Some investors prefer investing in JEPI , EOI or BST because while they generate lower yields, they offer wider diversification and a combination of growth potential and reduced volatility. On the other hand, other investors are tempted by $GOF\u2019s 13% yield, just like this Redditor has been. With $200K available to invest, the Reddit member sparked a dramatic debate on the discussion board with over 2.6K users after posting his dilemma on the r/dividends community. Don't Miss: Arrived Home's Private Credit Fund\u2019s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%* , which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum. Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. Should he invest in $GOF for $2,166/month or diversify his portfolio with JEPI, EOI or BST and go the safer route? He mentioned he\u2019s impressed by $GOF\u2019s 13% yield but has doubts about long-term stability, a concern that has received plenty of advice in the comments. \u201cGOF\u2019s yield is tempting, but I\u2019m concerned about concentration risk and NAV erosion,\u201d he wrote. If he diversified his portfolio and chose the safer route, he said it would lower his revenue to around $1,250 to $1,333 per month. \u201cThe diversified approach would lower my yield to around 7.5-8% ($1,250-1,333/month) but might offer better stability and growth potential,\u201d the poster said. Let\u2019s analyze the community members\u2019 recommendations for the investor. See Also: During market downturns, investors are learning that unlike equities, these high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% \u2013 9% are protected by resilient assets, buffering against losses. $GOF vs. JEPI, EOI or BST: Redditors Share Their Advice Diversify Across Several Platforms The very first comment to the Reddit post suggested that the advice-seeking investor diversify his acquisitions. After all, the put-your-eggs-in-one-basket approach is said not to always have a good outcome, at least according to some investors, including this one. \u201cI am an income investor; the majority of my total return comes from income rather than price movement. Therefore, income is a top priority for me and I avoid going all-in or investing even 25% in any single asset. To some extent, having more cash flow streams is better than having just a few,\u201d the Reddit user said. Story Continues The Redditor even explained to the investor why diversification is better through a simple example. \u201cFor example, if someone holds 50 positions generating 2% of their income each, the reduction or elimination of dividends/distributions from one or two of those positions won\u2019t significantly impact overall income generation,\u201d he explained. Trending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! Don\u2019t Rely Too Much on High-Yield Investments Many investors on Reddit seem to advise against riskier investments and this post has received a few such recommendations. One commenter explained that he owned a good chunk of high-yield investments but because they are riskier than low-yield investments, he decided to limit it to under 10% of his portfolio. \u201cI hold a lot of GOF (roughly 8% of total portfolio). Such a high yield and ROC scare me a bit, so I limit it to under 10% of the total portfolio. I also like PTY as far as CEFs go and I have a large amount of real estate (O, WPC, CCI and ABR) to go with a mix of growth and income/growth ETFs. I found a mix that helps me sleep a little better,\u201d the Redditor wrote. Trending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 for properties like the Byer House from Stranger Things. Mix High-Yield CEFs With Other Conservative Investments A few investors in the r/dividends community advised the poster to blend high-yield CEFs with a few other conservative options. \u201cI am glad to see you are open to CEFs. I personally like them because their primary focus is on generating income. You listed equity CEFs, but these funds also invest in fixed-income assets like corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and preferred stocks, providing a way to diversify away from equities,\u201d one Redditor said. While not many comments specifically mentioned JEPI, EOI or BST, this one Reddit member mentioned all of them and shared a bit of his experience. \u201cI\u2019ve had BST since Nov. last year and have continued buying. Only because of the recent downtrend is my cap. Gains < 0% and it\u2019s been paying pretty steadily. EOI, I\u2019m not familiar with. JEPI seems to have a pretty good history. I owned it for a bit, then split those funds into JEPQ and something more conservative from my LTS (long-term strategy) watch list,\u201d the Redditor said.

Interest Rates Are Falling, But These Yields Aren't Going Anywhere Lower interest rates mean some investments won't yield what they did in months past, but you don't have to lose those gains. Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities. Arrived Home's Private Credit Fund\u2019s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%* , which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100. Looking for fractional real estate investment opportunities?

{"text": "GRIN Therapeutics Presents Data from Honeycomb Trial of Radiprodil at the American Epilepsy Society Annual Meeting PR Newswire Mon, Dec 9, 2024, 4:00 PM 6 min read Previously reported Honeycomb topline results showed radiprodil was generally well-tolerated A key secondary analysis demonstrated a median reduction of 86% in countable motor seizure frequency consistent across GRIN genotypes with gain-of-function variants Company also outlined proposed plans for a Phase 3 pivotal trial expected to begin early 2025 NEW YORK , Dec. 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0GRIN Therapeutics, Inc., a leader in the development of therapies to treat serious neurodevelopmental disorders, presented additional topline data this weekend from the Company's Honeycomb trial, an ongoing global Phase 1b open-label trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of radiprodil, an investigational, selective and potent negative allosteric modulator of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subtype 2B (NR2B or GluN2B), in development for the treatment of GRIN-related neurodevelopmental disorder with gain-of-function (GoF) variants. The results, together with an overview of the proposed design of the Company's planned Phase 3 pivotal trial for radiprodil, were presented as a late-breaking poster at the American Epilepsy Society (AES) Annual Meeting in Los Angeles, California . \"We are excited to share updated data from the Honeycomb trial, which highlights the significant progress we've made in our effort to bring a new treatment to people living with GRIN-related neurodevelopmental disorder,\" said Bruce Leuchter , MD, president and chief executive officer of GRIN Therapeutics. \"As we plan for the launch of our pivotal Phase 3 trial for radiprodil, we are deeply grateful to the patients and families whose dedication and participation have been instrumental in driving this development program forward. Our team remains fully committed to collaborating closely with regulators, advocates, investigators, clinicians, and the broader community to advance this important research effort as rapidly as possible.\" As the next phase in the development program for radiprodil, GRIN Therapeutics plans to initiate a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 pivotal trial in early 2025, which will include two cohorts of patients with confirmed GoF mutations in the GRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2B, or GRIN2D genes, one cohort enrolling patients who have experienced qualifying countable motor seizures (CMS) and a second cohort enrolling patients without qualifying CMS. The proposed Phase 3 pivotal trial was designed based on analysis of positive topline data from the Phase 1b Honeycomb trial in which radiprodil appeared generally well-tolerated, with the most commonly observed adverse events associated with infections or underlying disease symptoms. Patients in the qualifying seizure cohort saw a median reduction of 86% in CMS frequency versus baseline which was consistent across GRIN genotypes. During the trial period, 71% of patients had a greater than 50% reduction in CMS and six of seven were seizure-free during at least 80% of days in the eight-week maintenance period. There were signs of favorable effect on clinical outcomes regardless of the occurrence of seizures as measured by Clinician and Caregiver Global Impressions of Change (CGI-C and CaGI-C) and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist \u2013 Community (ABC-C). Story Continues \"GRIN-related neurodevelopmental disorder was first characterized in 2010 and only formally named in 2014. Since then, research and advocacy communities have worked tirelessly to identify approaches to treatment that are both targeted and able to alter the natural course of the disease,\" said Michael A. Panzara , MD, MPH, chief medical officer of GRIN Therapeutics. \"The readout from the Honeycomb trial is an important milestone towards the goal of providing treatment options to patients with and without seizures who suffer from GRIN-related neurodevelopmental disorder with GoF variants. Our plans for a rapid transition to a pivotal Phase 3 study reflect our sense of urgency and commitment to these patients.\" About GRIN-related neurodevelopmental disorder GRIN-related neurodevelopmental disorder is a family of rare, genetically defined pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders caused by mutations in GRIN genes. While symptoms of GRIN-related neurodevelopmental disorder can present as early as infancy, a diagnosis is often not confirmed until age two or later when a child fails to reach developmental milestones. Individuals may experience developmental delay, intellectual disabilities, epilepsy, muscular hypotonia, movement disorders, spasticity, feeding difficulties and behavioral problems. There are currently no approved therapies for GRIN-related neurodevelopmental disorder. About Radiprodil Radiprodil is an investigational, selective and potent negative allosteric modulator of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subtype 2B (NR2B or GluN2B). In nonclinical studies, radiprodil has been shown to potently and selectively modulate GluN2B. Radiprodil has also demonstrated an antiseizure effect in a number of in vitro and in vivo preclinical seizure and epilepsy models and specifically in models characterized by an enhanced GluN2B NMDA transmission, which can occur with gain-of-function (GoF) mutations in GRIN-related neurodevelopmental disorder. In vitro analysis of brain tissues extracted from both tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) lesions has shown enhanced GluN2B NMDA expression supporting the potential ability of radiprodil to control seizures in these conditions. About GRIN Therapeutics GRIN Therapeutics is dedicated to the research and development of precision therapeutics for pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders with the goal of bringing hope to patients and caregivers. Working to develop novel therapies for patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, the company has two ongoing clinical trials to evaluate radiprodil for the potential treatment of GRIN-related neurodevelopmental disorder and other neurological conditions including tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type II.

2024 /PRNewswire/ -- GRIN Therapeutics Inc., a leader in development of therapies to treat serious neurodevelopmental disorders, today announced that it will present findings from the company's Phase 1b Honeycomb clinical trial assessing the effects of radiprodil, the company's investigational GluN2B negative allosteric modulator, in the treatment of GRIN-related neurodevelopmental disorder with gain-of-function (GoF) variants. The poster presentation, to be held at the American Epilepsy Society's (AES) Annual Meeting, December 6-10 in Los Angeles, CA , will also include a review of the proposed design of the planned Phase 3 clinical trial for radiprodil scheduled to initiate in early 2025. Presentation Details: Title: Pharmacokinetics, Safety/Tolerability, and Effect on Seizure Frequency and Behavior of Individually Titrated Radiprodil Doses in Children with GRIN-Related Disorder: Topline Multicenter Study Data Presenter: Pierandrea Muglia, MD, Founder, GRIN Therapeutics Session date/time: Saturday, December 7, 12:00 \u2013 6:00pm PST Additional information about the meeting can be found on the AES website . About Radiprodil: Radiprodil is an investigational, selective and potent negative allosteric modulator of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subtype 2B (NR2B or GluN2B). In nonclinical studies, radiprodil has been shown to potently and selectively modulate NMDA NR2B or GluN2B. Radiprodil has also demonstrated an antiseizure effect in a number of in vitro and in vivo preclinical seizure and epilepsy models and specifically in models characterized by an enhanced GluN2B-NMDA transmission, which can occur with gain-of-function (GoF) mutations in GRIN-related neurodevelopmental disorder. In vitro analysis of brain tissues extracted from both tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) lesions has shown enhanced GluN2B-NMDA expression supporting the potential ability of radiprodil to control seizures in these conditions. About GRIN Therapeutics: GRIN Therapeutics is dedicated to the research and development of precision therapeutics for pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders with the goal of bringing hope to patients and caregivers. Working to develop novel therapies for patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, the company has two ongoing clinical trials to evaluate radiprodil for the potential treatment of GRIN-related neurodevelopmental disorder and other neurological conditions including tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type II.
