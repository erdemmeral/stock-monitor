The Milk Powder market is expected to reach US$ 51.96 billion by 2033 from US$ 33.69 billion in 2024, with a CAGR of 4.93 % from 2025 to 2033. The increased demand for products as a result of urbanization and population growth worldwide, the growing infant formula market, rising health consciousness that encourages the consumption of dietary supplements, the growth of the bakery and confectionery industries, and improved dairy technology are some of the factors driving the market. Growth Drivers for the Milk Powder Market Growing baby formula market A key component of infant formula, a necessary food item for non-breastfed babies, is milk powder. Given its vital function in giving babies the vitamins, minerals, and nutrition they need, the growing infant formula business greatly drives the milk powder market. Rising worldwide birth rates, expanding numbers of working moms looking for convenient feeding options, and growing knowledge of the advantages of enriched infant formula are all driving this industry's expansion. The market is supported by the growing demand for premium milk powder as producers work to satisfy the strict quality and nutritional requirements needed for baby nourishment. Urbanization and population growth Due to increased demand for convenient, non-perishable food items brought on by worldwide urbanization and population growth, the milk powder industry is booming. Food items like milk powder that are easy to store and last a long time are preferred by urban lifestyles, which are defined by hectic schedules and smaller living areas. It provides a useful answer for customers looking for wholesome, easy-to-make solutions that blend in with the hectic pace of the city. The industry is growing because milk powder's longevity and storage effectiveness - which eliminates the need for refrigeration - perfectly match the urban need for food alternatives that are long-lasting and convenient. Notable expansion in the confectionary and baking industries Because it can improve the flavor, texture, and shelf life of goods like cakes, cookies, and chocolates, milk powder is essential to the bakery and confectionery sectors. The need for milk powder rises as these industries grow internationally. Its adaptability enables a variety of uses, ranging from enhancing baked goods' tenderness to acting as a crucial component in confections. The global demand for milk powder is fueled by the growing trend of artisanal and premium baked goods, the innovation of bakery and confectionery products, and the growing indulgence in sweets by consumers. Challenges in the Milk Powder Market Story Continues Competition from plant-based alternatives The market for milk powder is becoming more and more competitive as plant-based dairy alternatives like soy, almond, oat, and coconut milk gain popularity. Due to their perceived sustainability and health benefits, customers who are concerned about their health - especially those who have lactose intolerance, milk allergies, or vegan preferences - are choosing these alternatives. In comparison to conventional dairy farming, plant-based milks are frequently promoted as being lower in calories, cholesterol-free, and more ecologically friendly because they use less water and have smaller carbon footprints. The milk powder sector is under pressure from this change in consumer behavior, particularly in regions where environmental and health trends are of utmost importance. Additionally, the market share of traditional dairy products is being further eroded by the fast diversification of plant-based goods, such as plant-based cheese, yogurt, and ice cream. Environmental sustainability The environmental impact of dairy production is significant, as it contributes to soil degradation, excessive water use, and greenhouse gas emissions. Methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, is produced by cows, and the dairy industry is responsible for a sizeable portion of agricultural emissions worldwide. Because producing milk requires a lot of water, which affects areas with water scarcity, water usage is also a big challenge. Intensive dairy farming methods can also result in biodiversity loss, deforestation, and soil erosion. There is growing pressure on milk powder manufacturers to embrace more sustainable techniques as a result of these environmental issues. To lessen the industry's environmental impact and satisfy consumer and regulatory expectations for more environmentally friendly production methods, innovations including methane-reducing feed additives, better waste management, water-efficient technologies, and sustainable agricultural practices are being investigated. Milk Powder Market Overview by Region By countries, the global Milk Powder market is divided into United States, Canada, Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Japan, China, India, South Korea, Indonesia, Australia, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, South Africa, and Rest of World. United States Milk Powder Market A significant sector of the dairy industry, the US milk powder market is fueled by both exports and domestic demand. Dairy-based substances, infant formula, and a variety of food products employ milk powder, including whole milk powder (WMP) and skim milk powder (SMP). The market gains from rising use in the beverage and food processing industries as well as a growing need for easy, shelf-stable dairy products. The market is confronted with obstacles, meanwhile, including competition from plant-based substitutes and growing environmental worries about the carbon footprint of dairy farming. Profitability is also impacted by changes in the price of feed and raw milk. The market is anticipated to increase in the upcoming years due to advancements in processing and packaging as well as rising global demand, especially in Asia. The country is anticipated to produce 1.30 million tons of skim milk powder in 2024, an 11% increase from current levels, due to increased milk production and an abundance of skim milk available for drying, according to a recent report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Global Agricultural Information Network (GAIN). Additionally, exports are expected to rise by 3% to 838,000 tons. After a minor decline in exports in 2023, this comeback is the result of a rise in exportable supplies and a resurgence of shipments to price-sensitive markets in East and Southeast Asia. Germany Milk Powder Market Due to robust export growth and consistent local demand, the German milk powder market accounts for a sizeable portion of the European dairy industry. Dairy components, infant formula, and culinary products all frequently contain milk powder, especially whole milk powder (WMP) and skim milk powder (SMP). Germany benefits from its high standards of production and sophisticated dairy farming methods as a major dairy producer. Innovations in processing technology and the growing desire for convenient, long-lasting dairy products are driving the industry. Consumer preferences are being influenced by issues including the growing competition from plant-based dairy substitutes and worries about the environmental effects of dairy farming. More environmentally friendly procedures are being adopted by milk powder producers as a result of the increased demand for organic and sustainable products. Export markets continue to be important growth engines, particularly in Asia and Africa. China Milk Powder Market Due to the strong demand for dairy products, particularly infant formula and nutritional supplements, the Chinese milk powder industry is one of the biggest and fastest-growing in the world. The demand for milk powder has increased as a result of the nation's expanding middle class, growing health consciousness, and rising disposable incomes. Because of previous scandals and worries about the safety of native milk, Chinese customers are increasingly looking for high-end, international milk powder brands. In food goods, whole milk powder (WMP) and skim milk powder (SMP) are frequently utilized, but infant formula continues to be a significant growing area. However, plant-based substitutes and persistent issues with the sustainability of dairy farming pose a threat to the business. With an emphasis on quality and safety standards, rising urbanization and government assistance for the dairy sector are anticipated to further drive market expansion. Saudi Arabia Milk Powder Market The growing population of Saudi Arabia and the growing need for handy, long-lasting dairy products are driving the country's milk powder market's expansion. Saudi Arabia, a significant importer of milk powder, depends on both domestic production and imports from other countries to meet its demands, particularly for skim milk powder (SMP) and whole milk powder (WMP). Growing health consciousness, particularly in metropolitan areas, is driving the market, and customers prefer milk powder because of its versatility and shelf stability in food goods, beverages, and baby formula. But issues like water scarcity and the effects of dairy production on the environment have spurred attempts to implement more environmentally friendly methods. Furthermore, the popularity of plant-based dairy substitutes is beginning to affect consumer preferences. The continued demand for high-end, foreign milk powder brands contributes to the expansion of the Saudi Arabian market.

"LRCX Dips 18% in Six Months: Time to Accumulate or Exit the Stock? Anirudha Bhagat Mon, Jan 20, 2025, 3:53 PM 4 min read In this article: LRCX -1.06% Lam Research Corporation LRCX has seen its stock price drop 17.8% over the past six months, significantly underperforming the Zacks Electronics \u2013 Semiconductors industry\u2019s gain of 27.3%. The stock has also underperformed industry peers, including Marvell Technology, Inc. MRVL, Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Ambarella, Inc. AMBA, over the same time frame. 6-Month Price Return Performance Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research This underperformance has raised questions about whether it\u2019s a buying opportunity or a signal to exit. While Lam Research\u2019s long-term prospects in the semiconductor space are undeniable, several short-term challenges and industry-specific headwinds suggest that selling the stock for now may be the more prudent move. Here\u2019s why. Declining WFE Spending to Hurt LRCX Growth Despite the cyclical downturn for the semiconductor industry now over, wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) spending is still under pressure. Although Lam Research expects a recovery in 2025, the timeline remains uncertain, particularly for the memory segment. NAND spending, which has been a key revenue driver for Lam Research, has struggled to rebound as customers delay investments in advanced nodes like 256-layer and 384-layer technologies. This delay directly impacts Lam\u2019s growth prospects, as the company relies heavily on NAND orders. With more than two-thirds of NAND bits still produced on older nodes, a slow transition to advanced technologies could prolong the current revenue softness. For now, the company\u2019s exposure to this segment creates significant uncertainty. Rising Costs to Weigh on LRCX Profitability In its most recent earnings report for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Lam Research reported gross margins of 48.2%, which, while robust, were affected by unfavorable customer and product mix and rising incentive compensation costs. These factors are likely to weigh on profitability. Furthermore, the company has committed to significant research & development investments to maintain its leadership in advanced packaging and AI-driven technologies. While these expenditures are necessary for long-term competitiveness, they may pressure near-term earnings and free cash flow. Investors seeking immediate returns may find this lack of short-term profitability unappealing, particularly given the near-term challenges. Wall Street analysts also seem cautious about Lam Research\u2019s near-term earnings growth potential. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 earnings has witnessed downward estimate revisions. Find the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar. Story continues Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Geopolitical and Regulatory Risks: A Concern for LRCX Lam Research\u2019s heavy reliance on China for revenue poses another significant risk. China accounted for approximately 37% of Lam Research\u2019s total sales in the most recent reported quarter. However, escalating U.S.-China trade tensions and tightening export restrictions on advanced semiconductor equipment are threatening this critical market. The U.S. government has already imposed new restrictions on chip-making tools, and further regulatory changes could materially impact Lam Research\u2019s ability to generate revenues from Chinese customers. This geopolitical overhang adds to the uncertainty surrounding the stock\u2019s near-term performance. LRCX\u2019s Elevated Valuation Limits Upside Despite its recent decline, Lam Research\u2019s stock remains expensive, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple higher than its historical averages. Also, LRCX has a Zacks Value Score of D, indicating a stretched valuation at present. This premium valuation reflects optimism about a future WFE recovery and AI-related growth, leaving little room for error. If the anticipated recovery is delayed or muted, the stock could face additional downward pressure. Forward 12-Month Price-To-Earnings Multiple Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Conclusion: Exit LRCX for Now While Lam Research remains a leader in the semiconductor industry with strong long-term potential, the current headwinds outweigh the opportunities. Persistent WFE market weakness, rising costs and geopolitical risks create a challenging near-term outlook. For investors, the prudent choice is to sell Lam Research stock for now and reassess once the industry shows clearer signs of recovery. Currently, LRCX carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Aniruddha Ganguly Mon, Jan 20, 2025, 6:36 PM 5 min read In This Article: APH -0.93% Amphenol APH is set to report its fourth-quarter 2024 results on Jan. 22. See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news . The company expects fourth-quarter 2024 earnings between 48 cents and 45 cents per share, indicating growth of 17-22% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings has been steady at 50 cents per share over the past 30 days, suggesting 21.95% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. Amphenol\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 7.65%. Amphenol Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Amphenol Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Amphenol Corporation price-eps-surprise | Amphenol Corporation Quote Let\u2019s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement. APH\u2019s Q4 Revenues to Grow Y/Y Amphenol expects fourth-quarter 2024 revenues between $3.95 billion and $4.05 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $4.03 billion, indicating an increase of 21.26% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. Amphenol\u2019s to-be-reported quarter results are expected to benefit from a robust order backlog, strong sales growth driven by acquisitions, and increased demand for the company\u2019s solutions in the defense and commercial aerospace sectors. APH reported record orders of $4.412 billion in the third quarter of 2024, resulting in a robust book-to-bill ratio of 1.09:1. This strong order backlog is likely to contribute positively to sales in the to-be-reported quarter. For fourth-quarter 2024, APH expects sales in the defense market to increase moderately on a sequential basis. Commercial Air sales are expected to grow in the high single digits. APH\u2019s Q4 Results to Ride on Acquisitions Acquisitions have expanded its high technology and value-added interconnect product offerings to end markets, including defense, commercial aerospace and industrial product offerings. Top-line growth is expected to be reflected by this trend. Strong contributions from the acquisitions, including CIT (Carlisle Interconnect Technologies) and Lutze US, are expected to enhance Amphenol\u2019s product offerings and sales capabilities in the next quarter, especially in high-technology interconnect products. APH\u2019s growth prospects are also bolstered by strong demand for AI technologies in the IT datacom market and increased investments in the defense sector. This trend is likely to have boosted the company\u2019s top line during the fourth quarter. APH Shares Beat Sector, Industry Amphenol shares have jumped 41.7% on a trailing 12-month basis, outperforming the Zacks Electronics Connectors industry\u2019s return of 40.7% and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector\u2019s appreciation of 27.8%. Story Continues APH has also outperformed broader sector peers including Methode Electronics MEI, Ambarella AMBA and Applied Materials AMAT over the same timeframe. While AMBA and AMAT shares have returned 41.8% and 14.1%, respectively, MEI has dropped 44.5%. APH Performance Chart Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research However, APH stock is trading at a premium, as suggested by the Value Score of D. In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Earnings, APH is trading at 31.88X, higher than the sector\u2019s 27.01X. Price/Earnings (F12M) Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Strong Portfolio, Acquisitions Aid APH\u2019s Prospects Expanding spending on both current and next-generation defense technologies bodes well for APH\u2019s top-line growth. Apart from Defense, Amphenol\u2019s prospects ride on strong demand for its solutions across Commercial Air, Industrial and Mobile devices. Amphenol\u2019s prospects ride on strong spending by countries around next-generation defense technologies. Strong demand for jet-liners and next-gen aircraft is bullish for the commercial aerospace segment. Amphenol plans to expand its high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offerings, both organically and through complementary acquisitions in the industrial domain. Amphenol\u2019s solutions are critical for both high-speed power and fiber optic interconnect solutions. The growing use of AI and machine learning is driving these technologies, benefiting APH\u2019s long-term prospects in the IT datacom end market. Acquisitions have helped APH strengthen its product offerings and expand its customer base. The CIT acquisition expanded Amphenol\u2019s footprint across defense, commercial air and industrial end markets. The Lutze business strengthens APH\u2019s broad offering of high-technology interconnect products for industrial markets and expands the range of value-added interconnect products. The acquisition of CommScope\u2019s Outdoor Wireless Networks (OWN) and Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) businesses expands Amphenol\u2019s footprint in the areas of base station antennas and related interconnect solutions, as well as distributed antenna systems. The pending DAS and OWN acquisitions will expand its footprint in the mobile networks market. Here\u2019s Why Amphenol is a Buy Amphenol\u2019s strong portfolio is a major driver and justifies a premium valuation. Its diversified business model lowers the volatility of individual end markets and geographies. APH\u2019s solid liquidity makes the stock attractive for investors. Strong cash flow generating ability is noteworthy as APH repurchased 2.7 million shares for $176 million paid dividends worth $132 million in third-quarter 2024. As of Sept. 30, 2024, total liquidity was $4.6 billion. APH shares are trading above the 200-day moving average, indicating a bullish trend.

Intelligence (AI) Stocks Are Outpacing Nvidia's, and They Can Still Soar Higher Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool Sun, Jan 19, 2025, 12:00 AM 7 min read In This Article: NVDA -2.84% LITE -0.88% AMBA -1.84% Nvidia stock has been one of the biggest winners of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution in the past couple of years, clocking remarkable gains of nearly 800% over the past two years\u00a0on account of the red-hot demand for its data center graphics cards, but the past three months have been difficult for the chipmaker. Shares of the semiconductor giant are down 1% over the past three months. That's a bit surprising considering that Nvidia delivered an outstanding set of results during this period that beat Wall Street's expectations. What's more, Nvidia's guidance was also better than what analysts were looking for. However, concerns about Nvidia's ability to sustain its outstanding growth, its valuation, and the short-term margin pressure that will be created by the ramp-up of its latest generation of Blackwell processors seem to be weighing on the company's stock price. Meanwhile, two other little-known chip companies have received a big boost in the past three months thanks to the positive impact of AI on their businesses: Ambarella (NASDAQ: AMBA) and Lumentum Holdings (NASDAQ: LITE) . While Ambarella stock has jumped 25% in the past three months, Lumentum has appreciated nearly 23%. Their gains have been better than what Nvidia has delivered during this period, and the good part is that the AI-focused growth drivers of both of the smaller chipmakers are just kicking in. Let's check out how AI is turning out to be a catalyst for Ambarella and Lumentum. 1. Ambarella The chips that Ambarella designs are deployed in automotive and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The company is primarily known for its computer vision chips that process images and video, and it is now finding applications in the field of AI as well. According to one estimate, the size of the AI computer vision processor market could grow from $17.2 billion in 2023 to $45.7 billion in 2028 thanks to the growing demand from multiple verticals such as automotive, security and surveillance, and consumer electronics applications. Ambarella's product portfolio already includes chips capable of processing AI workloads in these applications. For instance, the company's CV5 processor that's based on an advanced 5-nanometer (nm) process node can run AI-based algorithms in automotive cameras, consumer cameras, and even robotics. Not surprisingly, the company is witnessing an increase in demand for this processor. CEO Fermi Wang remarked on the company's November 2024 earnings conference call that its new higher-priced AI inference processors, such as the CV5, are driving record AI revenue and also contributing toward a higher average selling price (ASP). The good part is that Ambarella expects the robust demand for CV5 to continue in fiscal 2026, which will begin next month. Additionally, the company estimates that the demand for its CV7 family of AI vision processors will pick up from the new fiscal year. Story Continues More importantly, this solid demand is translating into outstanding growth for Ambarella. Its revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (which ended on Oct. 31, 2024) increased an impressive 63% year over year to $82.7 million. The chipmaker also swung to an adjusted profit of $0.11 per share from a loss of $0.28 per share in the year-ago period. Ambarella's fiscal Q4 guidance of $78 million would translate into a 51% increase in its revenue from the year-ago quarter. The company is on track to finish fiscal 2025 with total revenue of $279 million, which would be a 23% improvement from the previous fiscal year. Its loss is expected to shrink to $0.30 per share from $0.83 per share in fiscal 2024. As the following chart shows, Ambarella's top and bottom lines are on track to improve further over the next couple of fiscal years, with the company expected to report an adjusted profit per share in fiscal 2027. AMBA Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Year data by YCharts The overall AI computer vision market is set for impressive growth over the next three years, so it won't be surprising to see Ambarella deliver the healthy growth that Wall Street is expecting from it. The company could be able to sustain its positive momentum for a longer period as well since it claims to have an automotive revenue pipeline of $2.2 billion through fiscal year 2031. If you throw in the prospects of AI computer vision processors in other areas such as consumer cameras and security applications, Ambarella may have enough room to grow its business significantly in the long run. 2. Lumentum Holdings The growing demand for high-speed data transmission in AI servers is driving robust growth in the networking equipment market. According to Morningstar, the spending on generative AI networking equipment could increase at an annual rate of 34% between 2023 and 2028, generating $34 billion in annual revenue at the end of the forecast period. Lumentum Holdings is already benefiting from this trend, witnessing a nice turnaround in its financial performance last quarter. The company's revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (which ended on Sept. 28, 2024) increased 6% year over year to $337 million. While that may not seem very impressive at first, investors should note that Lumentum's top line was down 23% in fiscal 2024 owing to soft demand from the cloud and networking and industrial segments. However, things have started changing for the better thanks to AI. Its cloud and networking revenue jumped 23% year over year in fiscal Q1 2025, offsetting the weakness in the industrial business. With cloud and networking now producing nearly 84% of Lumentum's top line, this business is set to drive stronger growth for the company. Lumentum points out that its cloud customer base is growing with the addition of new hyperscale customers that are placing orders for its lasers that are used in fiber-optic cables to enable high-speed data transmission in AI servers. What's more, Lumentum is busy expanding its manufacturing capacity so that it can fulfill more orders. These favorable developments explain why Lumentum's revenue estimate of $390 million for the current quarter would again be an improvement of 6% over the prior year. Even better, analysts are expecting the company's growth rate to improve as the year progresses. Consensus estimates are projecting a 17% jump in Lumentum's revenue for fiscal 2025 to $1.59 billion, which is expected to be followed by even stronger growth in the next fiscal year. LITE Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts The robust top-line growth is expected to filter down to the bottom line, with Lumentum's earnings expected to jump by 56% in the current fiscal year to $1.58 per share followed by healthy growth in the next couple of years as well. LITE EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts It won't be surprising to see the market rewarding this tech stock with more upside thanks to its improving earnings power. That's why it isn't too late for investors to buy Lumentum Holdings as its cloud and networking business seems set for better times ahead thanks to AI.

Zacks Equity Research Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 5:06 PM 2 min read In This Article: LASR -1.79% AMBA -1.84% nLight LASR shares soared 5.9% in the last trading session to close at $10.46. The move was backed by solid volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This compares to the stock's 2.3% loss over the past four weeks. nLight is benefiting from strong growth in its aerospace and defense business, driven by increased demand for directed energy systems and laser sensing products. This laser maker is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.14 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -7.7%. Revenues are expected to be $51.15 million, down 1.4% from the year-ago quarter. While earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. For nLight, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions.
