The report tracks home price changes less than four weeks behind real time at the national, state and metropolitan (Core-Based Statistical Area) levels and includes metropolitan price tiers that segment sale transactions into starter, mid and luxury tiers. The full report can be found here . December 1 Home Price Index Dallas-Plano-Irving Market Metric Change in HPI November-December 2024 (month over month) -0.1 percent December 2023-December 2024 (year over year) +0.7 percent National HPI Metric Change in HPI November-December 2024 (month over month) +0.1 percent December 2023-December 2024 (year over year) +3.9 percent Chief Economist National HPI Analysis: \"House price growth nationally started 2024 strong at a 7 percent annualized pace of growth but gradually slowed over the course of the year, ending in the high 3 percent year-over-year growth range. Higher mortgage rates in the latter half of the year, combined with higher inventory levels, triggered the cooling trend. If similar conditions persist through 2025, we should expect very moderate price appreciation,\" said Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American. \"Areas with rapid supply growth that outstrips demand may face stronger moderation or even price declines, while areas with limited new supply may see steadier price growth or even price reacceleration. The structural housing shortage nationally will keep a floor on how low prices can go, but a \u2018higher-for-longer\u2019 rate environment and inventory growth could cause further price moderation.\" Year-Over-Year Price-Tier Data for the Dallas-Plano-Irving Metro Area: December 2023 to December 2024 The First American Data & Analytics HPI segments home price changes at the metropolitan level into three price tiers based on local market sales data: starter tier, which represents home sales prices at the bottom third of the market price distribution; mid-tier, which represents home sales prices in the middle third of the market price distribution; and the luxury tier, which represents home sales prices in the top third of the market price distribution. Story Continues CBSA Starter Mid-Tier Luxury Dallas-Plano-Irving -0.6% +0.3% +3.3% \"House price growth has varied considerably at the regional level over the last year, largely driven by differences in for-sale inventories. As more homes become available, the power dynamics can shift in favor of buyers, putting downward pressure on prices,\" said Fleming. \"All else equal, house price growth in markets with higher inventory of homes available for sale will weaken compared to those with low inventory relative to demand.\" December 2024 First American Data & Analytics Price Tier HPI Highlights 2 Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) Ranked by Greatest Year-Over-Year Increases in Starter Tier HPI CBSA Change in Starter Tier HPI Change in Mid- Tier HPI Change in Luxury Tier HPI Pittsburgh +9.5 percent +2.7 percent +4.0 percent Cambridge, Mass. +6.0 percent +7.6 percent +6.8 percent New York +5.3 percent +5.2 percent +3.7 percent St. Louis +5.1 percent +2.9 percent +4.2 percent Anaheim, Calif. +5.0 percent +7.0 percent +6.6 percent Additional December 2024 First American Data & Analytics HPI Highlights Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) with Greatest Year-Over-Year Increases in HPI CBSA Change in HPI Anaheim, Calif. +6.1 percent Cambridge, Mass. +6.0 percent Pittsburgh +5.8 percent Las Vegas +4.4 percent Warren, Mich. +4.3 percent Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) with a Year-Over-Year Decease in HPI Tampa, Fla. -4.6 percent Oakland, Calif. -0.8 percent Austin, Texas -0.2 percent Los Angeles -0.1 percent San Antonio +0.5 percent HPI data for all 50 states and the largest 30 CBSAs by population is available here .

Next Release The next release of the First American Data & Analytics House Price Index will take place the week of February 17, 2025. First American Data & Analytics HPI Methodology The First American Data & Analytics HPI report measures single-family home prices, including distressed sales, with indices updated monthly beginning in 1980 through the month of the current report. HPI data is provided at the national, state and CBSA levels and includes preliminary index estimates for the month prior to the report (i.e. the preliminary result of July transactions is reported in August). The most recent index results are subject to revision as data from more transactions become available. The HPI uses a repeat-sales methodology, which measures price changes for the same property over time using more than 46 million paired transactions to generate the indices. In non-disclosure states, the HPI utilizes a combination of public sales records, MLS sold and active listings, and appraisal data to estimate house prices. This comprehensive approach is particularly effective in areas where there is limited availability of accurate sale prices, such as non-disclosure states. Property type, price and location data are used to create more refined market segment indices. Real Estate-Owned transactions are not included.

mortgage rates in the latter half of the year, combined with higher inventory levels, triggered the cooling trend, says Chief Economist Mark Fleming\u2014 SANTA ANA, Calif., January 27, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- First American Data & Analytics , a leading national provider of property-centric information, risk management and valuation solutions and a division of First American Financial Corporation (NYSE: FAF), today released its December 2024 Home Price Index (HPI) report. The report tracks home price changes less than four weeks behind real time at the national, state and metropolitan (Core-Based Statistical Area) levels and includes metropolitan price tiers that segment sale transactions into starter, mid and luxury tiers. The full report can be found here . December 1 Home Price Index Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale Market Metric Change in HPI November-December 2024 (month over month) -0.8 percent December 2023-December 2024 (year over year) -0.1 percent National HPI Metric Change in HPI November-December 2024 (month over month) +0.1 percent December 2023-December 2024 (year over year) +3.9 percent Chief Economist National HPI Analysis: \"House price growth nationally started 2024 strong at a 7 percent annualized pace of growth but gradually slowed over the course of the year, ending in the high 3 percent year-over-year growth range. Higher mortgage rates in the latter half of the year, combined with higher inventory levels, triggered the cooling trend. If similar conditions persist through 2025, we should expect very moderate price appreciation,\" said Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American. \"Areas with rapid supply growth that outstrips demand may face stronger moderation or even price declines, while areas with limited new supply may see steadier price growth or even price reacceleration. The structural housing shortage nationally will keep a floor on how low prices can go, but a \u2018higher-for-longer\u2019 rate environment and inventory growth could cause further price moderation.\" Year-Over-Year Price-Tier Data for the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale Metro Area: December 2023 to December 2024 The First American Data & Analytics HPI segments home price changes at the metropolitan level into three price tiers based on local market sales data: starter tier, which represents home sales prices at the bottom third of the market price distribution; mid-tier, which represents home sales prices in the middle third of the market price distribution; and the luxury tier, which represents home sales prices in the top third of the market price distribution. Story Continues CBSA Starter Mid-Tier Luxury Los Angeles-Long-Beach-Glendale -0.2% +2.0% +0.4% \"House price growth has varied considerably at the regional level over the last year, largely driven by differences in for-sale inventories. As more homes become available, the power dynamics can shift in favor of buyers, putting downward pressure on prices,\" said Fleming. \"All else equal, house price growth in markets with higher inventory of homes available for sale will weaken compared to those with low inventory relative to demand.\" December 2024 First American Data & Analytics Price Tier HPI Highlights 2 Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) Ranked by Greatest Year-Over-Year Increases in Starter Tier HPI CBSA Change in Starter Tier HPI Change in Mid-Tier HPI Change in Luxury Tier HPI Pittsburgh +9.5 percent +2.7 percent +4.0 percent Cambridge, Mass. +6.0 percent +7.6 percent +6.8 percent New York +5.3 percent +5.2 percent +3.7 percent St. Louis +5.1 percent +2.9 percent +4.2 percent Anaheim, Calif. +5.0 percent +7.0 percent +6.6 percent Additional December 2024 First American Data & Analytics HPI Highlights Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) with Greatest Year-Over-Year Increases in HPI CBSA Change in HPI Anaheim, Calif. +6.1 percent Cambridge, Mass. +6.0 percent Pittsburgh +5.8 percent Las Vegas +4.4 percent Warren, Mich. +4.3 percent Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) with a Year-Over-Year Decease in HPI Tampa, Fla. -4.6 percent Oakland, Calif. -0.8 percent Austin, Texas -0.2 percent Los Angeles -0.1 percent San Antonio +0.5 percent HPI data for all 50 states and the largest 30 CBSAs by population is available here .

Next Release The next release of the First American Data & Analytics House Price Index will take place the week of February 17, 2025. First American Data & Analytics HPI Methodology The First American Data & Analytics HPI report measures single-family home prices, including distressed sales, with indices updated monthly beginning in 1980 through the month of the current report. HPI data is provided at the national, state and CBSA levels and includes preliminary index estimates for the month prior to the report (i.e. the preliminary result of July transactions is reported in August). The most recent index results are subject to revision as data from more transactions become available. The HPI uses a repeat-sales methodology, which measures price changes for the same property over time using more than 46 million paired transactions to generate the indices. In non-disclosure states, the HPI utilizes a combination of public sales records, MLS sold and active listings, and appraisal data to estimate house prices. This comprehensive approach is particularly effective in areas where there is limited availability of accurate sale prices, such as non-disclosure states. Property type, price and location data are used to create more refined market segment indices. Real Estate-Owned transactions are not included.

combined with higher inventory levels, triggered the cooling trend, says Chief Economist Mark Fleming\u2014 SANTA ANA, Calif., January 27, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- First American Data & Analytics , a leading national provider of property-centric information, risk management and valuation solutions and a division of First American Financial Corporation (NYSE: FAF), today released its December 2024 Home Price Index (HPI) report. The report tracks home price changes less than four weeks behind real time at the national, state and metropolitan (Core-Based Statistical Area) levels and includes metropolitan price tiers that segment sale transactions into starter, mid and luxury tiers. The full report can be found here . December 1 Home Price Index Atlanta-Sandy Springs Alpharetta Market Metric Change in HPI November-December 2024 (month over month) 0.0 percent December 2023-December 2024 (year over year) +1.9 percent National HPI Metric Change in HPI November-December 2024 (month over month) +0.1 percent December 2023-December 2024 (year over year) +3.9 percent Chief Economist National HPI Analysis: \"House price growth nationally started 2024 strong at a 7 percent annualized pace of growth but gradually slowed over the course of the year, ending in the high 3 percent year-over-year growth range. Higher mortgage rates in the latter half of the year, combined with higher inventory levels, triggered the cooling trend. If similar conditions persist through 2025, we should expect very moderate price appreciation,\" said Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American. \"Areas with rapid supply growth that outstrips demand may face stronger moderation or even price declines, while areas with limited new supply may see steadier price growth or even price reacceleration. The structural housing shortage nationally will keep a floor on how low prices can go, but a \u2018higher-for-longer\u2019 rate environment and inventory growth could cause further price moderation.\" Year-Over-Year Price-Tier Data for the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Alpharetta Metro Area: December 2023 to December 2024 The First American Data & Analytics HPI segments home price changes at the metropolitan level into three price tiers based on local market sales data: starter tier, which represents home sales prices at the bottom third of the market price distribution; mid-tier, which represents home sales prices in the middle third of the market price distribution; and the luxury tier, which represents home sales prices in the top third of the market price distribution. Story Continues CBSA Starter Mid-Tier Luxury Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Alpharetta +1.3% +2.6% +6.0% \"House price growth has varied considerably at the regional level over the last year, largely driven by differences in for-sale inventories. As more homes become available, the power dynamics can shift in favor of buyers, putting downward pressure on prices,\" said Fleming. \"All else equal, house price growth in markets with higher inventory of homes available for sale will weaken compared to those with low inventory relative to demand.\" December 2024 First American Data & Analytics Price Tier HPI Highlights 2 Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) Ranked by Greatest Year-Over-Year Increases in Starter Tier HPI CBSA Change in Starter Tier HPI Change in Mid-Tier HPI Change in Luxury Tier HPI Pittsburgh +9.5 percent +2.7 percent +4.0 percent Cambridge, Mass. +6.0 percent +7.6 percent +6.8 percent New York +5.3 percent +5.2 percent +3.7 percent St. Louis +5.1 percent +2.9 percent +4.2 percent Anaheim, Calif. +5.0 percent +7.0 percent +6.6 percent Additional December 2024 First American Data & Analytics HPI Highlights Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) with Greatest Year-Over-Year Increases in HPI CBSA Change in HPI Anaheim, Calif. +6.1 percent Cambridge, Mass. +6.0 percent Pittsburgh +5.8 percent Las Vegas +4.4 percent Warren, Mich. +4.3 percent Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) with a Year-Over-Year Decease in HPI Tampa, Fla. -4.6 percent Oakland, Calif. -0.8 percent Austin, Texas -0.2 percent Los Angeles -0.1 percent San Antonio +0.5 percent HPI data for all 50 states and the largest 30 CBSAs by population is available here .

Next Release The next release of the First American Data & Analytics House Price Index will take place the week of February 17, 2025. First American Data & Analytics HPI Methodology The First American Data & Analytics HPI report measures single-family home prices, including distressed sales, with indices updated monthly beginning in 1980 through the month of the current report. HPI data is provided at the national, state and CBSA levels and includes preliminary index estimates for the month prior to the report (i.e. the preliminary result of July transactions is reported in August). The most recent index results are subject to revision as data from more transactions become available. The HPI uses a repeat-sales methodology, which measures price changes for the same property over time using more than 46 million paired transactions to generate the indices. In non-disclosure states, the HPI utilizes a combination of public sales records, MLS sold and active listings, and appraisal data to estimate house prices. This comprehensive approach is particularly effective in areas where there is limited availability of accurate sale prices, such as non-disclosure states. Property type, price and location data are used to create more refined market segment indices. Real Estate-Owned transactions are not included.

combined with higher inventory levels, triggered the cooling trend, says Chief Economist Mark Fleming\u2014 SANTA ANA, Calif., January 27, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- First American Data & Analytics , a leading national provider of property-centric information, risk management and valuation solutions and a division of First American Financial Corporation (NYSE: FAF), today released its December 2024 Home Price Index (HPI) report. The report tracks home price changes less than four weeks behind real time at the national, state and metropolitan (Core-Based Statistical Area) levels and includes metropolitan price tiers that segment sale transactions into starter, mid and luxury tiers. The full report can be found here . December 1 Home Price Index Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land Market Metric Change in HPI November-December 2024 (month over month) +0.2 percent December 2023-December 2024 (year over year) +2.1 percent National HPI Metric Change in HPI November-December 2024 (month over month) +0.1 percent December 2023-December 2024 (year over year) +3.9 percent Chief Economist National HPI Analysis: \"House price growth nationally started 2024 strong at a 7 percent annualized pace of growth but gradually slowed over the course of the year, ending in the high 3 percent year-over-year growth range. Higher mortgage rates in the latter half of the year, combined with higher inventory levels, triggered the cooling trend. If similar conditions persist through 2025, we should expect very moderate price appreciation,\" said Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American. \"Areas with rapid supply growth that outstrips demand may face stronger moderation or even price declines, while areas with limited new supply may see steadier price growth or even price reacceleration. The structural housing shortage nationally will keep a floor on how low prices can go, but a \u2018higher-for-longer\u2019 rate environment and inventory growth could cause further price moderation.\" Year-Over-Year Price-Tier Data for the Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land Metro Area: December 2023 to December 2024 The First American Data & Analytics HPI segments home price changes at the metropolitan level into three price tiers based on local market sales data: starter tier, which represents home sales prices at the bottom third of the market price distribution; mid-tier, which represents home sales prices in the middle third of the market price distribution; and the luxury tier, which represents home sales prices in the top third of the market price distribution. Story Continues CBSA Starter Mid-Tier Luxury Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land +0.7% +2.8% +4.1% \"House price growth has varied considerably at the regional level over the last year, largely driven by differences in for-sale inventories. As more homes become available, the power dynamics can shift in favor of buyers, putting downward pressure on prices,\" said Fleming. \"All else equal, house price growth in markets with higher inventory of homes available for sale will weaken compared to those with low inventory relative to demand.\" December 2024 First American Data & Analytics Price Tier HPI Highlights 2 Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) Ranked by Greatest Year-Over-Year Increases in Starter Tier HPI CBSA Change in Starter Tier HPI Change in Mid-Tier HPI Change in Luxury Tier HPI Pittsburgh +9.5 percent +2.7 percent +4.0 percent Cambridge, Mass. +6.0 percent +7.6 percent +6.8 percent New York +5.3 percent +5.2 percent +3.7 percent St. Louis +5.1 percent +2.9 percent +4.2 percent Anaheim, Calif. +5.0 percent +7.0 percent +6.6 percent Additional December 2024 First American Data & Analytics HPI Highlights Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) with Greatest Year-Over-Year Increases in HPI CBSA Change in HPI Anaheim, Calif. +6.1 percent Cambridge, Mass. +6.0 percent Pittsburgh +5.8 percent Las Vegas +4.4 percent Warren, Mich. +4.3 percent Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) with a Year-Over-Year Decease in HPI Tampa, Fla. -4.6 percent Oakland, Calif. -0.8 percent Austin, Texas -0.2 percent Los Angeles -0.1 percent San Antonio +0.5 percent HPI data for all 50 states and the largest 30 CBSAs by population is available here .

Next Release The next release of the First American Data & Analytics House Price Index will take place the week of February 17, 2025. First American Data & Analytics HPI Methodology The First American Data & Analytics HPI report measures single-family home prices, including distressed sales, with indices updated monthly beginning in 1980 through the month of the current report. HPI data is provided at the national, state and CBSA levels and includes preliminary index estimates for the month prior to the report (i.e. the preliminary result of July transactions is reported in August). The most recent index results are subject to revision as data from more transactions become available. The HPI uses a repeat-sales methodology, which measures price changes for the same property over time using more than 46 million paired transactions to generate the indices. In non-disclosure states, the HPI utilizes a combination of public sales records, MLS sold and active listings, and appraisal data to estimate house prices. This comprehensive approach is particularly effective in areas where there is limited availability of accurate sale prices, such as non-disclosure states. Property type, price and location data are used to create more refined market segment indices. Real Estate-Owned transactions are not included.

combined with higher inventory levels, triggered the cooling trend, says Chief Economist Mark Fleming\u2014 SANTA ANA, Calif., January 27, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- First American Data & Analytics , a leading national provider of property-centric information, risk management and valuation solutions and a division of First American Financial Corporation (NYSE: FAF), today released its December 2024 Home Price Index (HPI) report. The report tracks home price changes less than four weeks behind real time at the national, state and metropolitan (Core-Based Statistical Area) levels and includes metropolitan price tiers that segment sale transactions into starter, mid and luxury tiers. The full report can be found here . December 1 Home Price Index New York-Jersey City-White Plains Market Metric Change in HPI November-December 2024 (month over month) -1.6 percent December 2023-December 2024 (year over year) +3.5 percent National HPI Metric Change in HPI November-December 2024 (month over month) +0.1 percent December 2023-December 2024 (year over year) +3.9 percent Chief Economist National HPI Analysis: \"House price growth nationally started 2024 strong at a 7 percent annualized pace of growth but gradually slowed over the course of the year, ending in the high 3 percent year-over-year growth range. Higher mortgage rates in the latter half of the year, combined with higher inventory levels, triggered the cooling trend. If similar conditions persist through 2025, we should expect very moderate price appreciation,\" said Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American. \"Areas with rapid supply growth that outstrips demand may face stronger moderation or even price declines, while areas with limited new supply may see steadier price growth or even price reacceleration. The structural housing shortage nationally will keep a floor on how low prices can go, but a \u2018higher-for-longer\u2019 rate environment and inventory growth could cause further price moderation.\" Year-Over-Year Price-Tier Data for the New York-Jersey City-White Plains Metro Area: December 2023 to December 2024 The First American Data & Analytics HPI segments home price changes at the metropolitan level into three price tiers based on local market sales data: starter tier, which represents home sales prices at the bottom third of the market price distribution; mid-tier, which represents home sales prices in the middle third of the market price distribution; and the luxury tier, which represents home sales prices in the top third of the market price distribution. Story Continues CBSA Starter Mid-Tier Luxury New York-Jersey City-White Plains +5.3% +5.2% +3.7% \"House price growth has varied considerably at the regional level over the last year, largely driven by differences in for-sale inventories. As more homes become available, the power dynamics can shift in favor of buyers, putting downward pressure on prices,\" said Fleming. \"All else equal, house price growth in markets with higher inventory of homes available for sale will weaken compared to those with low inventory relative to demand.\" December 2024 First American Data & Analytics Price Tier HPI Highlights 2 Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) Ranked by Greatest Year-Over-Year Increases in Starter Tier HPI CBSA Change in Starter Tier HPI Change in Mid-Tier HPI Change in Luxury Tier HPI Pittsburgh +9.5 percent +2.7 percent +4.0 percent Cambridge, Mass. +6.0 percent +7.6 percent +6.8 percent New York +5.3 percent +5.2 percent +3.7 percent St. Louis +5.1 percent +2.9 percent +4.2 percent Anaheim, Calif. +5.0 percent +7.0 percent +6.6 percent Additional December 2024 First American Data & Analytics HPI Highlights Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) with Greatest Year-Over-Year Increases in HPI CBSA Change in HPI Anaheim, Calif. +6.1 percent Cambridge, Mass. +6.0 percent Pittsburgh +5.8 percent Las Vegas +4.4 percent Warren, Mich. +4.3 percent Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) with a Year-Over-Year Decease in HPI Tampa, Fla. -4.6 percent Oakland, Calif. -0.8 percent Austin, Texas -0.2 percent Los Angeles -0.1 percent San Antonio +0.5 percent HPI data for all 50 states and the largest 30 CBSAs by population is available here .

Next Release The next release of the First American Data & Analytics House Price Index will take place the week of February 17, 2025. First American Data & Analytics HPI Methodology The First American Data & Analytics HPI report measures single-family home prices, including distressed sales, with indices updated monthly beginning in 1980 through the month of the current report. HPI data is provided at the national, state and CBSA levels and includes preliminary index estimates for the month prior to the report (i.e. the preliminary result of July transactions is reported in August). The most recent index results are subject to revision as data from more transactions become available. The HPI uses a repeat-sales methodology, which measures price changes for the same property over time using more than 46 million paired transactions to generate the indices. In non-disclosure states, the HPI utilizes a combination of public sales records, MLS sold and active listings, and appraisal data to estimate house prices. This comprehensive approach is particularly effective in areas where there is limited availability of accurate sale prices, such as non-disclosure states. Property type, price and location data are used to create more refined market segment indices. Real Estate-Owned transactions are not included.

trend, says Chief Economist Mark Fleming\u2014 SANTA ANA, Calif., January 27, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- First American Data & Analytics , a leading national provider of property-centric information, risk management and valuation solutions and a division of First American Financial Corporation (NYSE: FAF), today released its December 2024 Home Price Index (HPI) report. The report tracks home price changes less than four weeks behind real time at the national, state and metropolitan (Core-Based Statistical Area) levels and includes metropolitan price tiers that segment sale transactions into starter, mid and luxury tiers. The full report can be found here . December 1 National House Price Index First American Data & Analytics\u2019 National Non-Seasonally Adjusted (NSA) HPI Metric Change in HPI November-December 2024 (month over month) +0.1 percent December 2023-December 2024 (year over year) +3.9 percent Highlights House prices nationally are now 54.8 percent higher compared to pre-pandemic levels (February 2020). House price decline reported in last month\u2019s HPI for October 2024 to November 2024 was revised down by 0.02 percentage points, from -0.01 percent to -0.03 percent. Chief Economist Analysis: \"House price growth nationally started 2024 strong at a 7 percent annualized pace of growth but gradually slowed over the course of the year, ending in the high 3 percent year-over-year growth range. Higher mortgage rates in the latter half of the year, combined with higher inventory levels, triggered the cooling trend. If similar conditions persist through 2025, we should expect very moderate price appreciation,\" said Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American. \"Areas with rapid supply growth that outstrips demand may face stronger moderation or even price declines, while areas with limited new supply may see steadier price growth or even price reacceleration. The structural housing shortage nationally will keep a floor on how low prices can go, but a \u2018higher-for-longer\u2019 rate environment and inventory growth could cause further price moderation.\" December 2024 Local Market Price Tier Highlights The First American Data & Analytics HPI segments home price changes at the metropolitan level into three price tiers based on local market sales data: starter tier, which represents home sales prices at the bottom third of the market price distribution; mid-tier, which represents home sales prices in the middle third of the market price distribution; and the luxury tier, which represents home sales prices in the top third of the market price distribution. Story Continues \"House price growth has varied considerably at the regional level over the last year, largely driven by differences in for-sale inventories. As more homes become available, the power dynamics can shift in favor of buyers, putting downward pressure on prices,\" said Fleming. \"All else equal, house price growth in markets with higher inventory of homes available for sale will weaken compared to those with low inventory relative to demand.\" December 2024 First American Data & Analytics Price Tier HPI Highlights 2 Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) Ranked by Greatest Year-Over-Year Increases in Starter Tier HPI CBSA Change in Starter Tier HPI Change in Mid-Tier HPI Change in Luxury Tier HPI Pittsburgh +9.5 percent +2.7 percent +4.0 percent Cambridge, Mass. +6.0 percent +7.6 percent +6.8 percent New York +5.3 percent +5.2 percent +3.7 percent St. Louis +5.1 percent +2.9 percent +4.2 percent Anaheim, Calif. +5.0 percent +7.0 percent +6.6 percent Additional December 2024 First American Data & Analytics HPI Highlights Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) with Greatest Year-Over-Year Increases in HPI CBSA Change in HPI Anaheim, Calif. +6.1 percent Cambridge, Mass. +6.0 percent Pittsburgh +5.8 percent Las Vegas +4.4 percent Warren, Mich. +4.3 percent Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) with a Year-Over-Year Decease in HPI Tampa, Fla. -4.6 percent Oakland, Calif. -0.8 percent Austin, Texas -0.2 percent Los Angeles -0.1 percent San Antonio +0.5 percent HPI data for all 50 states and the largest 30 CBSAs by population is available here .

Next Release The next release of the First American Data & Analytics House Price Index will take place the week of February 17, 2025. First American Data & Analytics HPI Methodology The First American Data & Analytics HPI report measures single-family home prices, including distressed sales, with indices updated monthly beginning in 1980 through the month of the current report. HPI data is provided at the national, state and CBSA levels and includes preliminary index estimates for the month prior to the report (i.e. the preliminary result of July transactions is reported in August). The most recent index results are subject to revision as data from more transactions become available. The HPI uses a repeat-sales methodology, which measures price changes for the same property over time using more than 46 million paired transactions to generate the indices. In non-disclosure states, the HPI utilizes a combination of public sales records, MLS sold and active listings, and appraisal data to estimate house prices. This comprehensive approach is particularly effective in areas where there is limited availability of accurate sale prices, such as non-disclosure states. Property type, price and location data are used to create more refined market segment indices. Real Estate-Owned transactions are not included.

In December 2024 , Galimedix Therapeutics announced the initiation of its Phase II eDREAM study to assess the safety and efficacy of GAL-101 eye drops in patients with dry age-related macular degeneration. In December 2024 , Ocugen, Inc. announced that the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for the OCU410 ArMaDa clinical trial recently convened and approved continuation of the second phase of the Phase 1/2 study. OCU410 (AAV5-hRORA) is a novel modifier gene therapy candidate being developed for geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to dry age-related macular degeneration (dAMD). In November 2024 , Ocugen, Inc. announced positive preliminary efficacy and safety data from the Phase I dose-escalation portion of the Phase 1/2 OCU410 ArMaDa clinical trial for geographic atrophy (GA), secondary to dry age-related macular degeneration (dAMD). Key findings include: no drug-related serious adverse events, reduced lesion growth, preservation of retinal tissue, and most importantly there was a positive effect on the functional visual measure of low luminance visual acuity (LLVA). In October 2024 , Eyestem Research, focused on creating scalable cell therapies for incurable diseases, had announced a positive outcome of the Drug Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) review for the first cohort of its Phase one trial to treat Geographic Atrophy secondary to Dry Age-related Macular Degeneration, marking a milestone for Indian science and medical research. In September 2024 , Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc. announced the presentation of new bevemipretide (SBT-272) preclinical data demonstrating topical ocular delivery to the retina with protective effects observed in models of AMD. In June 2024 , Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc. announced that it has enrolled and dosed its first patient in the ReNEW trial as part of its Phase III clinical program for elamipretide in patients with dry age-related macular degeneration (dry AMD). The program consists of the two Phase III trials, ReNEW and ReGAIN. Both trials will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of daily subcutaneous injections of elamipretide in participants with dry AMD. In April 2024 , \u00a0 Eyestem received approval from India's Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO) to commence human trials for Eyecyte RPE, a potential treatment for geographic atrophy arising from dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Story Continues Request a sample and discover the recent advances in dry AMD treatment drugs @ Dry Age-Related Macular Degeneration Pipeline Report The dry AMD pipeline report provides detailed profiles of pipeline assets, a comparative analysis of clinical and non-clinical stage dry AMD drugs, inactive and dormant assets, a comprehensive assessment of driving and restraining factors, and an assessment of opportunities and risks in the dry AMD clinical trial landscape. Dry Age-Related Macular Degeneration Overview Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the top four causes of blindness in older adults and the leading cause of irreversible blindness in developed countries. Around 170 million people globally are affected by AMD, making it the third most common cause of vision loss worldwide. Dry AMD typically progresses slowly, but wet AMD can cause severe visual impairment within days or weeks of onset. In the early stages of AMD, there are no noticeable symptoms, though an ophthalmologist can detect drusen before symptoms arise. Some individuals experience slight vision changes during the intermediate stage, but many remain symptom-free. Others may notice dark or grey spots in their central vision or have difficulty transitioning from bright to dim lighting. Clinicians currently use various imaging techniques to monitor changes in the retina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and choroid, including fundus exams, color fundus photography, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and infrared reflectance imaging. Over the past two decades, OCT has significantly advanced the early detection, monitoring, and treatment assessment of dry AMD. Modern spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) systems provide detailed cross-sectional and volumetric views of the retina, enabling clinicians to visualize, measure, and monitor retinal layers, RPE, hyperreflective foci, geographic atrophy (GA), and drusen. While SD-OCT remains the standard of care, emerging technologies like polarization-sensitive OCT (PS-OCT), which offers tissue-selective imaging, may revolutionize AMD research and clinical practices. Currently, no approved treatments exist for dry AMD. Management involves regular monitoring, timely detection of visual deterioration, appropriate rehabilitation, and early identification of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Research is underway to explore therapeutic strategies to prevent AMD, slow its progression, or restore vision. Potential treatments include lifestyle and behavioral changes, age-related eye disease study (AREDS) supplements, visual cycle modulators, anti-inflammatory agents, complement inhibitors, gene therapy, cell-based therapies, and approaches to reduce toxic by-products.
