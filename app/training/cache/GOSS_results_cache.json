(Nasdaq: GOSS), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of seralutinib for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD), today announced one oral and three poster presentations related to seralutinib at the Pulmonary Vascular Research Institute (PVRI) 2025 Annual Congress taking place January 29 th through February 1 st in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. \"Gossamer is committed to generating and presenting data that reflect the rapidly evolving pulmonary hypertension treatment landscape to best address the needs of patients. To that end, we are immensely proud to be able to present data from preclinical models that provide evidence of a synergistic treatment effect from the combination of seralutinib and sotatercept, a recently approved therapy for the treatment of PAH,\" said Faheem Hasnain, Co-Founder, CEO, and Chairman of Gossamer Bio. \"These data underscore seralutinib\u2019s potential to transform the PAH treatment paradigm, if approved, and they highlight the potential promise of these complementary mechanisms of action when utilized in combination. PAH is a progressive disease in which polypharmacy is the standard of care, and these preclinical results further build upon the positive PAH patient data generated in the Phase 2 TORREY Study, in which a majority of patients were on triple background PAH therapy.\" \"Furthermore, our ongoing global registrational Phase 3 PROSERA Study in PAH allows for the enrollment of a small number of patients on stable background treatment with sotatercept, provided they meet study entry criteria. All other patients who are enrolled in PROSERA may add sotatercept after 24 weeks, where approved and as appropriate. These study design elements will provide a limited, first-in-human combination experience with seralutinib and sotatercept, and importantly, they have been welcomed by patients and investigators, alike,\" added Mr. Hasnain.

Daugherty Lofts.

(Photo: Business Wire) CLINTON, Tenn., January 24, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Hunt Capital Partners, in collaboration with Hickory Creek Capital Partners, celebrated the grand opening and ribbon cutting for Daugherty Lofts in downtown Clinton, Tennessee on Thursday, January 23 rd . Located at 307 N Main Street, Daugherty Lofts is the adaptive reuse of the Daugherty Lofts Furniture Company Building, a popular 1942 retail store that was enlisted on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010, to create a mix of 39 one-, two-, and three-bedroom loft-style apartment homes for workforce families. The property is comprised of a five-story midrise building that introduces affordable housing for families earning up to 50% and 60% of the Area Median Income (AMI). To mark the special occasion, speeches were provided by key partners including Hickory Creek Capital Partners Founder Kent Leach, Clinton City Mayor Scott Burton, Anderson County Chamber of Commerce Head Rick Meredith, and Hunt Capital Partners Acquisitions Senior Director Mike Jacobs. Chelsea Ivens, State Field Director from the office of U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn, and Emily McCaul, Regional Field Director from the office of U.S. Senator Hagerty, were also in attendance to support the grand opening. The ribbon cutting was followed by home tours and light refreshments. \"It's been a long road starting in 2020 when we won the tax credits just as COVID was getting started. We've faced every adversity you could think of \u2013 rising construction costs, rising interest rates, material shortages, longer lead times, just to name a few. But seeing these doors open and people moving into their new homes, it makes me realize we've done a really good thing here,\" said Hickory Creek Capital Partners Founder Kent Leach. \"Not only have we given an old building new life, we're making these really unique living spaces available at an affordable rent. It really makes it worth all the adversity we've gone through.\" Daugherty Loft has a rich history deeply intertwined with the transformative period of World War II, particularly through the economic boom brought by the Manhattan Project in nearby Oak Ridge. During this era, Anderson County saw a significant surge in population growth due to the influx of workers which, in turn, spurred local economies by increasing demand for various household commodities like furniture, hardware, and appliances. These items were essential for accommodating the rapidly growing workforce. Today, projects like Daugherty Lofts aim to honor and preserve this historical essence through adaptive reuse. This approach not only conserves the architectural integrity and cultural heritage of such buildings, but also repurposes them for contemporary use, notably for affordable housing. This method of redevelopment provides a sustainable solution by revitalizing sturdy, abandoned structures to meet community needs while retaining their historical significance. Story Continues \"The adaptive reuse of the Daugherty building represents a testament to innovate housing solutions, which protects the structure\u2019s historical legacy while offering new housing options for families who need an affordable place to live,\" said Hunt Capital Partners Chief Operating Officer Amy Dickerson. \"We\u2019re proud to partner with Hickory Creek Capital Partners to add 39 high-quality, desirable affordable homes that blend history with function right in the historic downtown district of Clinton.\" The apartment homes are equipped with central air conditioning, ceiling fans, and coat and walk-in closets, as well as in-unit appliances such as a refrigerator, microwave, and dishwasher. Spacious area amenities include a community room, computer lab, central laundry, lounge area, and elevators. The rehabilitated building preserves its architectural character with features such as original milk doors, a 20 th century stone exterior, metal casement windows, rustic hardwood floors, and a restored 5 th floor skylight. Residents will have access to services provided by Anderson County Community Action Commission, a local non-profit agency dedicated to mobilizing social services within Anderson County since 1965. Services range from a weekly food pantry to rent and utility assistance. Daugherty lofts was financed, in part, with $9.1 million in federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits and $1.4 million in Historic Tax Credits (HTCs) syndicated by Hunt Capital Partners. Legacy Bank & Trust provided $10.6 million in construction financing and $2.1 million in permanent financing. Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development provided $300,000 in grand funding. River and Valley Department, LLC provided a $650,000 soft seller note. Hickory Creek Capital Partners is the general partner for the development. Frizzell Construction Company, Inc. is the general contractor and Goss Design Development is the architect of record. D&K Management, Inc. is the property manager. Environmental Social and Corporate Governance (\"ESG\") Investing Hunt Capital Partners recognizes that its institutional investors are seeking to increase the social value of their investments to help further their ESG initiatives. Investment in affordable housing not only improves the living conditions of its residents, but it also helps to remove obstacles that stand in the way of creating a healthy, safe and stable home environment for low-income families and seniors. When families spend less on housing related expenses, they have more resources available for other essentials such as food and clothing, or even extracurricular activities and educational programs. One of the most significant benefits to providing quality affordable housing is an increase in an individual\u2019s physical and mental health. Hunt Capital Partners\u2019 affordable housing investments create a lasting effect on the people and communities they serve for generations to come.

to corporate America: Stop 'illegal' DEI or face investigations Jessica Guynn, USA TODAY Actualizado Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 11:10 PM 6 min read Just days after taking office, President Donald Trump sent a clear message to corporate America : Follow the federal government\u2019s lead and \u201cend illegal DEI discrimination\u201d or face civil rights investigations. Trump\u2019s executive order aims to end diversity, equity and inclusion policies in the federal government and affirmative action in federal contracting. It bars the government from pushing contractors to diversify their workforce and taps federal agencies to use Civil Rights-era laws \u201cto combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences, mandates, policies, programs and activities.\u201d DEI policies \u201cundermine our national unity, as they deny, discredit and undermine the traditional American values of hard work, excellence and individual achievement in favor of an unlawful, corrosive and pernicious identity-based spoils system,\u201d the order said. The widely anticipated action to overturn decades of affirmative action and diversity precedent is expected to have an immediate chilling effect on corporate DEI efforts. While the federal government does not have a direct say over the private sector\u2019s diversity practices, it has wide purview over companies that depend on federal funding or hold government contracts . \"These actions freeze DEI operations in the federal government with the anticipation of the end of such programs,\" said Jonathan Butcher, a senior research fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank. \"Corporations,\" he said, \"should recognize that racial discrimination and racial preferences will no longer go unchallenged by Washington.\" Trump action expected to have immediate chilling effect Trump\u2019s executive order fulfills his campaign pledge to \u201cterminate\u201d DEI and reverse Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cwoke takeover\u201d of America \u2013 goals championed by his close allies and cheered by crowds at his rallies. Trump has cast DEI as illegal discrimination against white Americans. Trump adviser and Tesla billionaire Elon Musk has called DEI \u201cjust another word for racism.\u201d DEI spending is also a priority of Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, a nongovernmental task force led by Musk with the goal of reducing the size and scope of government. \"This is going to start a tidal wave of companies self-censoring and cutting back on those types of DEI efforts for fear of litigation with the federal government on the other end of that,\" said Joseph Seiner, a law professor at the University of South Carolina. \"Even if they're doing everything that complies with federal law, they could still find themselves subject to an investigation, which can be expensive and timely to defend against.\" Leer m\u00e1s Protesters rally as the U.S. Supreme Court hears oral arguments in affirmative action college admission cases in 2022. DEI rollback threatens workplace progress, civil rights leaders warn Coming less than five years after George Floyd\u2019s murder led corporations to embrace greater equality in their workforce and leadership ranks, civil rights leaders warned the rollback \u2013 telegraphed in the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project 2025 \u2013 threatens to reverse the progress women and people of color have made in the workplace over the past six decades. Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League, and other civil rights leaders are calling for a \u201cmassive resistance movement,\u2019\u2019 including meeting with corporate leaders, urging people to write to congressional lawmakers and taking legal action. \u201cWe are not going back,\u2019\u2019 Morial said. \u201cWe owe it to our ancestors. We owe it to our children.\u201d Diversity and civil rights advocates say affirmative action policies are still needed to fight discrimination in cubicles and executive suites and on factory floors. Each year, thousands of companies land federal contracts , serving hot meals or manufacturing missile defense systems. For decades, taking a slice of the hundreds of billions the U.S. government spends each year on goods and services came with anti-discrimination strings. In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson signed an executive order holding federal contractors to a higher standard than other employers in ensuring that women and people of color have equal opportunities in hiring , training and promotions. DEI case 50 years later: Why affirmative action still divides the nation. Nearly six decades later, an analysis by USA TODAY of federal contractors data obtained by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting showed those firms were not living up to that commitment. Deep racial divides cut through the workforces of federal contractors, which employ 1 in 5 American workers.\u00a0Though the employee ranks in these companies have diversified, the top jobs that command the best pay and benefits have not, mirroring the private sector at large, the analysis found. \u201cIn less than 48 hours in office, President Donald Trump has eviscerated his promise to be a champion of workers, gutting basic workplace equal opportunity protections that have been in place for 60 years,\u201d Fatima Goss Graves, CEO and president of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, said in a statement. \u201cThese protections were enforced by the Department of Labor, and by removing this important watchdog, Trump has opened up workers to workplace discrimination.\u201d President Donald Trump signs executive orders in the Oval Office of the White House on January 20, 2025 in Washington, DC. Employers pledged to stand by their DEI policies. Tim Bartl, CEO of the HR Policy Association, which represents hundreds of senior human resource executives across the country, said his organization would work with the Trump administration to ensure America\u2019s largest employers can seek \u201cthe best talent regardless of race, sex, religious beliefs in order to win in the marketplace.\u201d \u201cThis EO hasn\u2019t changed the law nor has it altered the commitment employers have to inclusive workplaces designed to attract and retain the best qualified talent,\u201d Bartl said. Trump executive power to slash DEI part of broader backlash Trump\u2019s executive order wiping out Johnson\u2019s is the latest in a series of moves to unwind affirmative action and diversity policies in America. Within hours of his swearing in, Trump revoked Biden executive orders to weave DEI into the fabric of the federal government. An incoming White House official told reporters during a background briefing on Monday that more DEI actions were coming for the private sector. Even before Trump took office, companies scaled back their corporate diversity efforts to align themselves with his administration. Last week, Amazon and Meta became the latest to make substantial changes. The push to end diversity initiatives began during Trump\u2019s first term and has grown since he\u2019s been out of office. Over the past few years, the private sector under fire from conservative foundations, think tanks and political operatives has dialed back diversity efforts. Those changes accelerated shortly after the Supreme Court in 2023 struck down affirmative action in higher education and as attitudes among U.S. workers on DEI began to shift. Anti-DEI activist Robby Starbuck\u2019s pressure campaigns on social media have forced more than a dozen companies to make DEI concessions, from Tractor Supply to Walmart . \"I see a lot of people saying DEI is dead. It\u2019s not,\" Starbuck said on X. \"It\u2019s cornered and in a position to die but we must be punishing and relentless in finishing this ideology off. No mercy.\" To that end, Trump has stocked his administration with anti-DEI allies \u2212 from Vice President JD Vance who, as an Ohio senator, introduced legislation that would prohibit government contractors from using federal funds for DEI initiatives to Trump\u2019s deputy chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller , who filed dozens of legal actions against \u201cwoke\u201d corporations. Trump tapped Andrea Lucas, a vocal DEI critic, to lead the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which has vast influence over U.S. employers. Lucas said she would root out \"unlawful DEI-motivated race and sex discrimination.\u201d In December, Trump asked Harmeet Dhillon to lead the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division, touting her record of \u201csuing corporations who use woke policies to discriminate against their workers.\u201d The Civil Rights Division was formed in 1957 to enforce laws to stop discrimination against Black people and other historically marginalized communities.

{"text": "Trump administration authorizes immigration enforcement on school campuses Zachary Schermele, USA TODAY Updated Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 5:57 PM 5 min read WASHINGTON \u2013 The Trump administration on Tuesday authorized federal authorities to conduct immigration arrests on school campuses, a decision a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said would prevent \"criminals\" from being able to \"hide in America\u2019s schools.\" The policy change, which immigration advocates expected, came a day after the president signed dozens of sweeping executive orders that could alter the educational landscape in the United States if left intact. After being sworn in, the president swiftly moved to undo broad swaths of his predecessor\u2019s regulatory agenda. He ordered the U.S. Department of Education to revoke troves of guidance that schools have relied on for years to maintain compliance with federal law. Many of the rules he targeted explicitly laid out protections for students vulnerable to discrimination or harassment due to their sexual orientation or gender identity. In his inauguration speech, he announced the directive unapologetically. \u201cAs of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female,\u201d Trump said. He also imposed a flurry of changes to curb immigration. He signed a controversial decree to end birthright citizenship, which is enshrined in the Constitution. And he instituted a hiring freeze across the federal government, including at the Education Department, which has long suffered from flat funding and inadequate staff in some of its most important offices. Presidents have limited authority to enact immediate change. So many of Trump\u2019s more contentious edicts will face considerable legal challenges. A coalition of 18 states filed suit Tuesday against the federal government to stop the birthright citizenship ban. That litigation followed a separate court challenge by the American Civil Liberties Union. More lawsuits are likely coming down the pike. Since most colleges and K-12 schools are bound by certain federal rules, a fresh sense of confusion has set in among school officials about which government regulations to follow. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear that these executive orders cannot create or change our laws,\u201d said Fatima Goss Graves, the president and CEO of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, a progressive group, in a statement. \u201cOnly Congress and the Supreme Court can do that.\u201d Apart from compliance concerns, Trump\u2019s critics say his suite of actions has already emboldened those who seek to harm marginalized people at school, especially undocumented or transgender students. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s actions today do nothing to help students learn and grow,\u201d Becky Pringle, the head of the National Education Association, the country\u2019s largest educators union, said in a statement Monday. \u201cThey need to be respected for who they are, no matter their race, place, background, sexual orientation, or gender identity.\u201d Story Continues What the Trump administration means for your identity: Sign up for USA TODAY's This is America newsletter. Sex discrimination laws up in the air Conservative groups like Parents Defending Education celebrated Trump\u2019s decision Monday to force the Education Department to scrap old guidance about supporting queer and transgender youth. \u201cOpposition to progressives' gender ideology spans both racial and political lines,\u201d said Nicole Neily, the organization\u2019s president, in a statement. \u201cWe're delighted that he kept his promise to the American people to put an end to this madness and look forward to the Department of Education putting in place policies and procedures that provide clarity to schools and families alike.\" Former President Joe Biden took big steps during his four years in office to use the levers of the federal government to support LGBTQ+ students and teachers. Under his leadership, the Education Department pursued a rewrite of a landmark sex discrimination law known as Title IX, formally broadening the definition of sexual harassment and misconduct to include gender identity and sexual orientation. Days before Biden left office, a federal judge halted those rules \u2013 which had only briefly taken effect in a patchwork of states, school districts and colleges amid legal wrangling. Now, in the wake of Trump\u2019s decrees, the regulatory whiplash has school administrators feeling \u201cjust distraught,\u201d said Brett Sokolow, a higher education attorney and the chair of the board of the Association of Title IX Administrators. \u201cWhy are we being told these completely opposite things?\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re living in two different Americas.\u201d Read more: USA TODAY spoke to Biden's education secretary days before he left office. Here's what he said about what worries him. Will a federal hiring freeze slow clarity for schools? Some clear guidance from Trump\u2019s Education Department, which has yet to staff some top posts, would be helpful, said Melissa Carleton, a higher education attorney. But the president\u2019s promise to implement a hiring freeze across the federal workforce could complicate that ask, she said. \u201cNow they\u2019re not going to fill any of the vacancies,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to move forward? Probably nothing for a while.\u201d An Education Department spokesperson declined to answer questions Tuesday about the hiring pause, Trump\u2019s return-to-work mandate for federal workers or the agency's plans to address the need for new Title IX guidance. Read more: 'Will I have a job?' Federal workers full of uncertainty, fear over Trump plans Deportation fears loom outside the classroom On Trump's first full day in office, the Department of Homeland Security officially rescinded a government protocol that prevented federal agents from conducting immigration enforcement at so-called \"sensitive locations,\" such as schools and churches. \"The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense,\" a DHS spokesperson said . School administrators have been gearing up for weeks to face the president's stricter immigration policies. Massive deportations on the scale Trump has promised could significantly disrupt the American education system. Roughly 6 million U.S. households are home to at least one undocumented resident, according to the Center for Migration Studies . There are approximately a half-million undocumented students enrolled in college nationwide. The National Education Association on Tuesday circulated new advice for school leaders grappling with the fallout of Trump\u2019s immigration orders. \"As educators, we have accepted the sacred responsibility to protect students \u2013 every single student, regardless of their immigration status,\u201d the union\u2019s president said in a statement. \u201cWe have a professional and moral responsibility to keep our students safe.\u201d (This story was edited to correct an error.)

Business Wire Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 5:30 PM 3 min read Acquisition of Recall Management Service Provider Extends Health Systems Supply Chain Automation Capabilities CINCINNATI, January 21, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--PAR Excellence Systems Inc. (\"PAR\"), a leading provider of supply chain integrity and cost management solutions to the healthcare industry, today announced the acquisition of NotiSphere, Inc. (\"NotiSphere\" or \"The Company\"), a provider of medical inventory recall notice tracking services to healthcare providers and medical device manufacturers. This acquisition underscores PAR\u2019s commitment to helping healthcare organizations enhance care quality while achieving significant savings in supply and labor costs through automated inventory management solutions. NotiSphere\u2019s core product enables healthcare providers and device manufacturers to improve patient safety by bringing visibility to a notoriously opaque and complex process while automating operations to realize meaningful cost savings. The Company transforms this process by ensuring only providers who have purchased a recalled product are notified and by providing visibility into the recall tracking process. With NotiSphere, both healthcare providers and device manufacturers can achieve a 95% reduction in time required to receive and accept a recall notice, an 80% reduction in time to respond to manufacturers on recall status, and a 90% reduction in false recall notices. Each year, more than 400 million medical product units are recalled in the United States, and yet health systems\u2019 current communication systems for product recalls are often outdated and inefficient. Hospitals receive notices for all recalled products, including ones they have not purchased, resulting in delays, increased labor costs and a potential risk to patient safety. NotiSphere\u2019s recall services complement PAR\u2019s existing portfolio of inventory management solutions. Together, PAR and NotiSphere can deliver comprehensive, end-to-end supply chain integrity and cost management solutions, driving digital transformation across the hospital inventory management market. \"Joining forces with PAR Excellence allows us to accelerate our vision of a smarter, more connected healthcare industry,\" said Guillermo Ramas, Founder and CEO of NotiSphere. \"This acquisition will empower providers and manufacturers alike, leveraging PAR Excellence\u2019s extensive reach and expertise to drive adoption of our recall management platform at scale.\" \"We are thrilled to welcome NotiSphere to the PAR family,\" said Thad MacKrell, CEO of PAR. \"PAR Excellence is on a mission to bring visibility, efficiency, and automation into healthcare supply chain management. This partnership marks a significant step forward in our mission to empower healthcare organizations with tools that optimize operations and ensure improved allocation of resourcing toward patient care. NotiSphere\u2019s approach to recall management aligns perfectly with our vision for an integrated and efficient healthcare supply chain.\" Story Continues Mark Welch, Sr. Vice President at Novant Health noted, \"At Novant Health, we are committed to leveraging innovative solutions that enhance patient safety and streamline operations. NotiSphere has consistently delivered exceptional value in simplifying medical device recall management, and its integration with PAR Excellence\u2019s robust suite of solutions is an exciting step forward for the healthcare industry. We look forward to seeing how this partnership will set new standards for efficiency and safety in healthcare supply chain management.\" Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP served as legal advisor to PAR Excellence.

Civil Rights Division, standing in the offices of the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division with a portrait of Thurgood Marshall, a civil rights lawyer and jurist who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1967 until 1991, on Jan. 16, 2025 in Washington, D.C. WASHINGTON \u2212 Moments after Attorney General Merrick Garland delivered a farewell address to his staff, Kristen Clarke returned to her office in the Justice Department to reflect on her own legacy as the nation\u2019s top civil rights enforcer. Clarke became the first Black woman to lead the department\u2019s Civil Rights Division while the nation was still reeling from the murder of George Floyd, the rapid spread of a pandemic that disproportionately harmed people of color, and a spike in hate and violence across the country . She said in an exclusive sit-down with USA TODAY that she's most proud of the work the division had done prosecuting the perpetrators of hate crimes and rogue law enforcement officers. Although her division scored major victories, particularly in the final months of the Biden administration, she couldn\u2019t help but wish it had done more during this \u201cvery busy period.\u201d \u201cThis is hard work, and work where I wish there were just, there was just more time in the day to do even more,\u201d she said as she sat surrounded by portraits of civil rights icons including Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and former South African President Nelson Mandela. Clarke will leave some of that work unfinished. But if she\u2019s worried about the Trump nominee set to replace her, Republican lawyer Harmeet Dhillon, abandoning or rolling back any of the progress she has made over the past four years, she doesn\u2019t show it. The career employees of the Justice Department \u201care dedicated folks who hold their head down, follow the facts, apply the law, and work to stand up for the American people, and they have done so from administration to administration, and I'm confident that they'll do so in the road ahead,\u201d Clarke said. Clarke felt like someone who could 'meet the moment' Clarke, the daughter of Jamaican immigrants who grew up in a Brooklyn housing project, has said she started her career by turning down high-paying jobs at corporate law firms to take her \u201cdream job\u201d working in the Justice Department during the George W. Bush administration. Kristen Clarke, assistant attorney general for civil rights, speaks at a press conferencewhere the Department of Justice delivered findings on the Investigation of the Louisville Metro Police Department and Louisville Metro Government, at Louisville Metro Hall on Wednesday, March 8, 2023. With her is U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland. She went on to work at the Civil Rights Bureau in the New York State Attorney General\u2019s Office and lead the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Both forged her outlook, those who worked with her say. \u201cThat sort of grounding in the day-to-day client stories and the level and intensity of litigation shaped her perspective, for sure,\u201d said National Women's Law Center President and CEO Fatima Goss Graves, who met Clarke while she was working at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. In 2021, Clarke returned to her dream job. Only this time, she was in charge. Story Continues And after four years of the Justice Department taking a backseat on issues like policing in the midst of a national reckoning on racial justice , Graves said it finally \u201cfelt like we would have someone to meet the moment.\u201d Garland quickly pledged to beef up Clarke's civil rights unit and launch an aggressive effort to fight policies that made it more difficult to vote, particularly for marginalized groups. Clarke, a longtime voting rights advocate, went on to sue several Southern states, including Alabama , Texas , Georgia , Virginia and Arizona , over their restrictions on voting. Clarke keeps a framed copy of the statement issued by Bush in July 2006 when Congress reauthorized the Voting Rights Act in her office. \u201cTo me, it is a reminder about our nation's long struggle to ensure that everyone has access to the ballot in our country, and of the bipartisan path that brought us a law that is arguably the most important federal civil rights law that our Congress has ever passed,\u201d she said. Kristen Clarke, the first Black woman to serve as assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division, on January 16, 2025 in Washington. Major wins, but more work to be done on police violence Garland revoked a Trump administration policy restricting the Justice Department's ability to force police departments investigated for abuse to make changes. That allowed Clarke to shed light on \u201cglaring areas of racial disparity\u201d in public safety, said Legal Defense Fund President and Director-Counsel Janai Nelson, who worked with Clarke in the early 2000s. The department convicted more than 180 police officers of civil rights abuses, including the officers known as the \u201cGoon Squad\u201d who tortured two Black men in Mississippi and those connected to the deaths of George Floyd , Breonna Taylor and Tyre Nichols . And in the final weeks of Biden's presidency, Clarke\u2019s team sprinted to the finish line and secured police-reform agreements with troubled law enforcement agencies in Minneapolis and Louisville , Kentucky. George Floyd's brother Philonise Floyd, left, with family attorney Ben Crump and Rev. Al Sharpton following the verdict in the Derek Chauvin trial. Though Clarke said these agreements have a proven track record of success, the work needed to sustain them could be derailed by the incoming administration, and reform efforts in cities like Memphis could be left hanging in the balance. During the previous Trump administration, the Justice Department launched only one investigation into a police department and made the practice of issuing consent decrees much harder. \"I was sworn into my role on the one year anniversary of the death of George Floyd, and it has been not lost on me that we have more work to do to advance the cause of justice,\" Clarke said. Combating hate takes a toll on Clarke How the country will confront the \"crisis of hate\" is one of the things Clarke said she is most worried about. As these offenses reached record levels , Clarke\u2019s department successfully prosecuted more than 125 people for such crimes, including three white men who killed Ahmaud Arbery , a Black jogger in Georgia, the mass shooter who killed 10 Black people in a supermarket in Buffalo, N.Y., and the white supremacist who killed 23 people at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas. This month, the Justice Department released a landmark report chronicling the 1921 race massacre when white attackers, including police, killed as many as 300 of Tulsa, Oklahoma\u2019s mostly Black residents. Protesters march through downtown during a \"March with Maud\" demonstration in downtown Athens, on Thursday, Feb. 23, 2023. Ahmaud Arbery was murdered during a racially motivated hate crime while jogging in Brunswick, Georgia on Feb. 23, 2020. Traveling the country and hearing from victims of some of the most heinous crimes and discrimination hasn\u2019t been easy, Clarke said, but she hopes making those people feel seen and heard will be a key part of her legacy. \u201cThese are the kind of stories that keep you up at night but also inspire you to come into work every day, to do the very best that you can, to use the law in ways to stand up for our nation's most vulnerable,\u201d she said. Those who know Clarke say her ability to connect with victims and survivors sets her work apart, including Taylor Dumpson, a hate crime survivor who was successfully represented by Clarke's team at the Lawyers\u2019 Committee in a lawsuit against neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin . Taylor Dumpson, left, a civil rights attorney for Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, and her mother, attorney Kimberly Dumpson, stand in line outside of the U.S. Supreme Court while waiting for their turn to enter the building while listening to early oral arguments on their cellphone. \u201cI see this through her relationship with the family of Dennis and Judy Shepherd, Matthew Shepard\u2019s parents , the families of James Byrd Jr. , families of Heather Heyer and families of Khalid Jabara , family of Lieutenant Collins III. Kristen, truly is like a family member to all of us,\u201d Dumpson said. \u201cAnd so to really be able to see the work she's done in hate crimes, to be able to both raise awareness, but also to enhance the state, local and tribal initiatives to make sure that they have support at the local level has also been really, really important.\u201d Clarke sees federal employees 'unfairly and unnecessarily targeted' From the outset, Clarke faced racist attacks as well as pushback from the GOP and right wing commentators . Seeing Clarke use her own lived experiences with racism and sexism to help others has been \u201cvery, very inspiring,\u201d said Dumpson, who now works at the attorney general\u2019s office in Rhode Island. She considers Clarke a mentor or \"work auntie,\" someone she can go to for advice on anything from legal issues to workwear, adding that Clarke is known for wearing colorful suits. During a heated 2\u00bd-hour nomination hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, several Senate Republicans, including Ted Cruz of Texas, were fiercely critical of Clarke and questioned whether she could be a nonpartisan enforcer of civil rights given statements she had made on issues such as voting rights, religious liberty and policing. Assistant AG Kristen Clarke testifies at House Judiciary hearing oversight of the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division on Dec. 5, 2023 in Washington. In July, 10 Senate Republicans, including Cruz, sent a letter to Garland urging him to fire Clarke for failing to disclose that she had been arrested in 2006 for a violent crime before her confirmation. Clarke has said the arrest happened while she was a victim of domestic abuse and wasn\u2019t disclosed because it was expunged from her record. Amy Spitalnick, CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs who worked with Clarke in the New York attorney general\u2019s office, said Clarke has been a frequent target, much like other women of color who are \"fighting hate and protecting democracy.\" \u201cWe saw a number of smears and other attacks directed at Kristen that were just not rooted in reality and that were fundamentally rooted in bigotry \u2026 but I have always deeply appreciated how she handled it with grace and with an unyielding focus on the work itself,\u201d Spitalnick said. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to prosecute his political rivals and throw Garland in jail. When asked if she was concerned for herself or the safety of her family, Clarke acknowledged that she has seen federal employees \u201cunfairly and unnecessarily targeted.\u201d \u201cI want to see the temperature turned down,\u201d she said. Advocates fear Trump rollbacks of civil rights Spitalnick said there are real fears that attacks on women, people of color and public servants more broadly will increase as the Trump administration assumes control. She said there was a packed sendoff for Clarke this week, and it was \u201cbittersweet\u201d as civil rights leaders like Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League, and attorney Ben Crump celebrated Clarke\u2019s achievements and advocates simultaneously steeled themselves for the fights they're sure will come. Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division speaks on a new report from the U.S. Department of Justice that found the Memphis Police Department routinely engages in policing that violates Memphians' civil rights during a press conference at the Odell Horton Federal Building in Memphis, Tenn., on Thursday, December 5, 2024. Trump, meanwhile, seems poised to turn the power of the Civil Rights Division against diversity, equity and inclusion policies designed to benefit the marginalized groups the division was created to protect. As for Clarke, she\u2019s focused on packing up her office and spending time with family, including her son Miles, a soccer player and college student studying finance and theology. Colleagues say it\u2019s unlikely she\u2019ll stay out of the civil rights fight for long, but Clarke said it will be hard to top the past four years. \"I leave here sad \u2013 it's a bittersweet moment \u2013 but incredibly proud of what we have been able to accomplish.\" Contributing: Kristine Phillips, USA TODAY; Brooke Muckerman , Memphis Commercial Appeal; Reuters This article originally
