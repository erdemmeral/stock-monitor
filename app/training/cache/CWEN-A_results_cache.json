Motley Fool Thu, Jan 16, 2025, 2:08 PM 5 min read In This Article: BEP -4.34% CWEN-A -0.73% Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC) (NYSE: BEP) and Clearway Energy (NYSE: CWEN) (NYSE: CWEN.A) are two of the largest renewable energy producers in the country. Those assets generate lots of steady cash flow, which they pay out in dividends. Brookfield Renewable currently yields nearly 5.5%, while Clearway Energy's payout is above 6.5%. Those high-yielding dividends make them two of the top renewable energy dividend stocks . However, since most investors don't want to hold too many stocks, they likely only have room for one in their portfolio. Here's a look at which is the better energy stock to buy right now. Similar, yet not the same Brookfield Renewable and Clearway Energy are leading renewable energy producers. They sell most of the power they produce under long-term, fixed-rate power purchase agreements (PPAs) with utilities and large corporate buyers. Those PPAs supply them with steady cash flow to fund their lucrative dividends. Another notable similarity is that parent companies sponsor and control these entities. Brookfield Corporation owns about a 48% interest in Brookfield Renewable, which is one of its operating businesses. Meanwhile, Clearway Energy Group (CEG), co-owned by TotalEnergies and BlackRock 's Global Infrastructure Partners, owns a controlling interest in Clearway Energy. Despite those similarities, there are several key differences between the two companies. Brookfield Renewable operates one of the world's largest publicly traded renewable power and decarbonization solutions platforms. Its globally diversified portfolio featuring hydroelectric, wind (onshore and offshore), and solar (utility-scale and distributed energy) assets spans five continents. It also has investments in global nuclear services, carbon capture, solar panel manufacturing, biofuels, and advanced recycling. In addition to its sizable operating portfolio (37 gigawatts, or GW), Brookfield Renewable is one of the largest clean energy developers in the world, with a massive pipeline of future projects (around 200 GW). It has acquired several renewable energy development companies around the world in recent years to enhance its expertise, increase its scale, and grow its pipeline. Clearway Energy, on the other hand, has a much more focused portfolio and strategy. It's one of the largest owners of clean energy generation assets in the U.S., with 11.7 GW of capacity across 26 states. It has about 9 GW of wind, solar, and energy storage capacity and over 2.7 GW of natural gas-fired power production capacity. Story Continues A differentiated growth profile Brookfield Renewable and Clearway Energy have a lot of visibility into their future growth due to their PPAs and secured investments. For example, Clearway Energy sold its thermal assets a few years ago and has been recycling that capital into higher-returning renewable energy investments. It has secured several dropdown transactions with CEG to acquire operating renewable energy assets it's developing. Those transactions give it lots of visibility into its ability to grow its cash available for distribution (CAFD) over the next few years. It expects to grow its CAFD by a 7.5% to 12.5% compound annual rate from this year's baseline through 2027, which should support dividend growth in the bottom half of its 5% to 8% annual target range. Over the longer term, it expects to deliver 5% to 8%-plus CAFD per share growth each year, supported by additional dropdowns of renewable energy projects developed by CEG. It aims to fund that growth primarily with retained cash after paying its dividend and new debt. That should support dividend growth within that target range. Meanwhile, Brookfield Renewable expects a quartet of growth drivers (inflation-linked rate increases on existing PPAs, securing higher market rates as legacy PPAs expire, development projects, and accretive M&A) to power more than 10% annual FFO per-share growth. That growth is highly visible and secured through 2029. It easily supports the company's plan to increase its dividend by around 5% to 9% annually. Brookfield's high-return development program is a big factor driving its higher growth rate. Development projects should add 4% to 6% to its FFO per share each year. On top of that, the company is a serial acquirer, thanks to its relationship with Brookfield Corporation, which manages several renewable energy funds through its Brookfield Asset Management subsidiary. That relationship provides Brookfield Renewable with more capital to fund acquisitions. Higher income now versus higher total return potential Clearway Energy currently offers a higher-yielding dividend (6.5%) that should grow by 5% to 8% annually in the foreseeable future. Because of that, it's a slightly better energy stock for investors who want more income in the near term. However, Brookfield Renewable expects to grow its cash flow much faster over the next several years, which could support a higher dividend growth rate over the long run. Because of that, it could have the power to produce higher total returns in the future. That makes it the better option for those seeking income with greater upside potential.

Jan 8, 2025, 3:02 PM 3 min read In This Article: CWEN -0.39% CWEN-A -0.73% What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. In light of that, when we looked at Clearway Energy ( NYSE:CWEN.A ) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled. Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Clearway Energy is: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.017 = US$228m \u00f7 (US$14b - US$661m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024) . Therefore, Clearway Energy has an ROCE of 1.7%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Renewable Energy industry average of 3.6%. View our latest analysis for Clearway Energy NYSE:CWEN.A Return on Capital Employed January 8th 2025 In the above chart we have measured Clearway Energy's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Clearway Energy . So How Is Clearway Energy's ROCE Trending? On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Clearway Energy doesn't inspire confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 4.9%, but since then they've fallen to 1.7%. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line. On a related note, Clearway Energy has decreased its current liabilities to 4.6% of total assets. So we could link some of this to the decrease in ROCE. Effectively this means their suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of the business, which reduces some elements of risk. Since the business is basically funding more of its operations with it's own money, you could argue this has made the business less efficient at generating ROCE. Our Take On Clearway Energy's ROCE Bringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Clearway Energy's reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 65% over the last five years. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high. Story Continues Clearway Energy does have some risks, we noticed 3 warning signs (and 1 which is a bit concerning) we think you should know about.

Fires Up CES Crowd MoneyShow Tue, Jan 7, 2025, 5:30 PM 2 min read The Nasdaq led the way yesterday with a solid advance, even as the Dow dipped. Today, equities are broadly higher along with gold, silver, and crude oil. Treasuries and the dollar are flattish. Enthusiasm for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the tech that powers it remains as high as ever. So, investors were VERY interested to hear what Nvidia Corp. ( NVDA ) CEO Jensen Huang had to say yesterday at the mammoth CES consumer electronics conference in Las Vegas.\u00a0He didn\u2019t disappoint, unveiling \u201cphysical AI\u201d tools aimed at improving robot performance...new chips for the automotive market...and a high-end supercomputer designed for researchers and scientists. Editor\u2019s Note: To get a FREE copy of the complete MoneyShow 2025 Top Picks Report , click HERE .) NVDA shares were already up more than 180% in the 12 months heading into the event. Now, they\u2019re trying to break out above previous technical resistance to a fresh all-time high above $150. US-China tensions ratcheted up another notch overnight, and investors in Chinese-domiciled companies are feeling the pain. The Department of Defense\u00a0called out several Chinese companies\u00a0for their alleged links to China\u2019s military, a \u201cblacklisting\u201d that doesn\u2019t carry formal sanctions but that makes US firms more reluctant to deal with them. Among those named were game publisher and Internet business operator Tencent Holdings Ltd. ( TCEHY )...a major Tesla Inc. ( TSLA ) supplier called Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd\u2026and the oil giant Cnooc Ltd. TCEHY shares fell here in the US, while Cnooc dropped in Hong Kong trading. The iShares China Large-Cap ETF ( FXI ) is one of the most popular ways to play Chinese stocks here in the US. It rallied strongly in Q4 2024 on stimulus plans, but has been taking on water in the last several weeks.

7, 2025, 1:00 PM 1 min read Sprouts Farmers Market Inc. ( SFM ) is a retailer of fresh, natural, and organic food products under the Sprouts brand in the US. The company offers fresh produce, meat, and meat alternatives, seafood, deli, bakery, floral, and dairy and dairy alternatives, showcases Louis Navellier , founder and chairman of Navellier & Associates . Editor\u2019s Note: To get a FREE copy of the complete MoneyShow 2025 Top Picks Report , click HERE .) Sprouts also sells non-perishable products such as groceries, vitamins and supplements, bulk items, frozen foods, beer and wine, and natural health and body care. See also: Top Picks 2025: Sezzle (SEZL) In the third quarter of 2024, Sprouts sales rose 13.6% to $1.946 billion from $1.713 billion in the same quarter a year ago.\u00a0During the same period, the company's earnings rose 42.2% to $91.6 million, or 91 cents per share, from $65.3 million, or 64 cents per share. The analyst\u00a0community wanted sales of $1.872 billion and earnings of 77 cents per share, so the company posted a 4% sales surprise and an 18.2% earnings surprise. Same-store sales growth has risen at an 8.4% annual pace \u2013 and more consumers are looking for alternatives to Whole Foods Market (commonly known as \u201cWhole Paycheck\u201d)! I expect Sprouts Farmers Market will continue to benefit from lower food prices and its strong same-store sales growth. The stock is a good buy.

Jan 7, 2025, 1:00 PM 2 min read Neo Performance Materials Inc. ( NEO.to ) has many growth drivers at its back, which makes it an ideal pick for the 2025 Top Picks report. The company processes and sells rare earth metals, magnets, and magnetic powders, highlights Philip MacKeller , editor of Contra the Heard . Editor\u2019s Note: To get a FREE copy of the complete MoneyShow 2025 Top Picks Report , click HERE .) These products are used throughout the economy in everything from medical imaging devices and wireless technologies to lighting and petroleum refining. Additionally, its products are important for electric vehicles and energy storage. This makes NEO a play on economic growth and the energy transition. The organization is making the most of the energy transition by rationalizing its operations in China and by expanding in Europe. The company is building a sintered magnet facility in Narva, Estonia. So far, the construction is on time and on budget, with commissioning expected in 2025. Once the plant is up and running, it should produce enough material for 1.5 million electric cars annually before phase two of construction begins. That should eventually result in the manufacturing of enough material for 4.5 million electric cars a year. This facility should drive significant sales and earnings appreciation in the years ahead, and the market should start to better value this asset now that phase one is near completion. Neo Performance could benefit from East/West tensions, too. It is one of the few, downstream rare earth manufacturers with operations outside of China. This could be important if the rivalry between China and Western democracies heats up or if President Trump follows through on his current threats and ignites a trade war. The market saw a glimpse of what this could look like in early December when China announced an export ban on gallium, germanium, and antimony to the US. The stock rallied in response and its business should be a benefactor of this decision. The enterprise has a clean balance sheet, low valuations, and is engaged in a strategic review. This may not yield any results. But it could unlock value via asset sales, divestments, or even the sale of the company. Any of these outcomes could boost the share price. All investments carry risk, and Neo Performance is no different. Though it has a huge footprint outside of China, it operates within the country as well. These sites could be impacted if a trade war goes into overdrive or if there is ever an armed conflict over Taiwan.

If Putin is successful in Ukraine and NATO fractures, Narva could top Putin\u2019s invasion list. Even if this does not happen, Neo sources certain materials from Russia, which could be caught up in sanctions. Risks and all, the stock has great growth drivers and is a way to own a bit of the future at a reasonable price.

Energy Corp. ( DUK ) presents a compelling investment opportunity for income-oriented investors. The company's strong dividend history, regulated business model, and robust growth prospects make it an attractive choice for long-term wealth building, counsels John Gardner , founder and principal of Blackhawk Wealth Advisors\u2019 Market Insights . Editor\u2019s Note: To get a FREE copy of the complete MoneyShow 2025 Top Picks Report , click HERE .) Duke has a long-standing commitment to reward shareholders through consistent dividend payouts. Last year was the 98th consecutive year that Duke Energy paid a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock. The company has also increased its dividends for 12 consecutive years. Dividend growth is an often-overlooked fundamental metric by income investors. The ability to consistently increase dividends is a testament to stable cash flow and effective management. Duke Energy has a 5-year dividend growth rate of 6%. The economic boom after World War II brought unprecedented demand for electric power. As fancy refrigerators, range-top ovens, and television sets became middle-class staples, the increased demand for modern-day conveniences prompted a shift to coal-fired generation. Today, Duke Energy is dedicated to identifying, integrating, and scaling up new technologies that make electricity cleaner, more reliable, and affordable. Duke is now focused on supporting clean energy and meeting the high demands from data centers. The company recently announced agreements with Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN ), Alphabet Inc. ( GOOGL ), and Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT ) to address rapid load growth caused by oncoming data centers and accelerate clean energy in the Carolinas. These technology giants are significantly driving electricity demand, primarily through extensive and rapidly expanding data center operations. These data centers are essential for supporting cloud services, AI development, and other digital operations. The facilities require vast amounts of power to run servers, cooling systems, and other infrastructure needed to store and process massive amounts of data. Looking ahead, Duke Energy faces a bright future thanks in part to AI. One reference: Even a simple ChatGPT task uses 10 times the energy that a normal Google search does. Duke Energy is expected to capitalize on this increasing energy demand. On top of the stable and sustainable investment income DUK provides, it is quite possibly an attractive \u201ctotal return\u201d stock. It is the combination of income and growth that equates to total return.

Add in the dividend and DUK could provide a total return of more than 15% in the year ahead.

6, 2025, 1:00 PM 2 min read Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ ) is one of the largest wireless carriers in the US. It recently traded with a market cap of $180 billion and it generates $134 billion in annual revenue. The stock\u2019s high 6.3% dividend yield immediately stands out. But there\u2019s more to Verizon stock than just a high yield, highlights Ben Reynolds , editor of Sure Dividend . Editor\u2019s Note: To get a FREE copy of the complete MoneyShow 2025 Top Picks Report , click HERE .) First, the company continues to invest for long-term growth. On Sept. 5, 2024, Verizon announced it would acquire Frontier Communications Inc. ( FYBR ) in an all-cash transaction based on a $20 billion enterprise value. Frontier is the largest pure-play fiber Internet provider in the US, so the acquisition will significantly strengthen Verizon\u2019s fiber network. The acquisition is expected to close in Q1 or Q2 of 2026 and be accretive to earnings per share in fiscal 2027. On Sept. 4, 2024, Verizon announced that it was increasing its quarterly dividend 1.9% to $0.6775, extending the company\u2019s dividend growth streak to 18 consecutive years. Verizon is the rare security that offers both a high 6%-plus dividend yield and a consistent track record of raising the dividend every year. On Oct. 22, 2024, Verizon reported third-quarter results for the period ending Sept. 30, 2024. For the quarter, revenue declined 0.1% to $33.3 billion. Adjusted EPS of $1.19 compared unfavorably to $1.22 in the prior year. Free cash flow totaled $14.5 billion for the first half of the year, compared to $14.6 billion last year. Verizon reaffirmed its prior guidance for 2024 as well. The company continues to expect adjusted EPS in a range of $4.50 to $4.70. At the midpoint of guidance of $4.60, 2024 will be the company\u2019s weakest year since fiscal 2017. We do expect the company to return to EPS growth in 2025 and beyond. Moving forward, we are projecting earnings growth of 2.5% over the next five years. This growth estimate is below the company\u2019s historical average due in part to the company\u2019s lackluster performance over the last few years. The company\u2019s all-time EPS high (so far) occurred in 2021. We expect Verizon to generate adjusted EPS of $4.60 in 2024. Based on this, the stock was recently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of less than 10. Our fair value estimate P/E ratio is 11 \u2013 so we believe Verizon stock to be undervalued at current prices. See also: Top Picks 2025: Clearway Energy (CWEN) The high 6%-plus dividend yield is well covered by earnings as the payout ratio is under 60% of expected fiscal 2024 EPS. Investors can hold Verizon, collect its sizeable dividend, as well as likely continued increases to the dividend in the years ahead, while waiting for the valuation multiple to increase.

PLUS Income ETF YGLD MoneyShow Mon, Jan 6, 2025, 12:59 PM 2 min read The Simplify Bitcoin Strategy PLUS Income ETF ( MAXI ) has been a big winner for investors since it launched in September 2022. In December 2024, Simplify launched a new ETF using the same options strategy as MAXI but with a leveraged bet on gold as the underlying asset. The new ETF is the Simplify Gold Strategy PLUS Income ETF ( YGLD ), explains Tim Plaehn , editor of The Dividend Hunter . Editor\u2019s Note: To get a FREE copy of the complete MoneyShow 2025 Top Picks Report , click HERE .) A year ago, we launched our ETF Income Edge service to provide information and guidance about the rapidly expanding universe of high-yield, option-strategy ETFs. Some crazy yields are reported for these ETFs, and we work to separate the ones that work for investors from the ones that will destroy your wealth. MAXI recently had a distribution yield of 51.8%. Through Dec. 5, 2024, MAXI had returned 96.3% for the last year and 348% since its launch. MAXI rode the rise of Bitcoin to reward investors. The ETF, with its option strategy, performed extremely well when Bitcoin was stuck in a trading range. As for YGLD, the fund targets a 150% exposure to the price of gold. It does so by holding T-bills and cash equal to 100% of the portfolio holdings \u2013 and purchasing gold futures valued at 150% of the portfolio size. Additional gold exposure comes from selling out-of-the money put credit spreads on the SPDR Gold Shares ETF ( GLD ). Also, unique to MAXI and now YGLD, the funds generate cash flow by selling puts on unrelated assets. The fund holdings list shows credit put spreads on MSTR (Bitcoin), RUTW (small cap stocks), and the SPX. YGLD launched on Dec. 2, 2024. As the dividends paid will vary from month to month, I expect the distribution yield to be similar to MAXI, which has ranged from 30% to 50%. YGLD could be a big winner in 2025 with that yield and some gains for gold. See also: Top Picks 2025: Clearway Energy (CWEN) I plan to keep MAXI in my recommended high-yield ETF portfolio but hope to add YGLD as soon as the fund has paid a few dividends and established a yield. One benefit from these options strategy ETFs is that you get paid very well while waiting for the underlying asset to make its move. Of the 96% MAXI returned over the last year, 72% was from dividend payments.

2025, 1:01 PM 2 min read You can count on the reliable earnings and generous dividends offered by utility stocks, which are still undervalued and under-represented in Americans\u2019 portfolios. For more aggressive investors, Clearway Energy Inc . ( CWEN ) fits the bill, advises Roger Conrad , editor of Conrad\u2019s Utility Investor . Just Released: The Golden Era: 3 Powerful Forces Driving Precious Metals Higher (& How YOU Can Profit!) Report Will the US economy avoid a hard landing? Has inflation really been tamed, or is it ready to flare up again? Will the Federal Reserve continue its pivot to lower interest rates? And how hard will the incoming Trump Administration push its campaign promises? Investors should be asking all those questions heading into 2025 \u2014 especially with nearly one-third of the S&P 500 weighted to just 6 \u201cBig Tech\u201d stocks, all currently priced to perfection. But utilities like CWEN remain attractive. The company has posted steadily growing cash flow and dividends by adding long-term contracted power generation since former parent NRG Energy Inc. ( NRG ) launched it as NRG Yield in the previous decade. And it has accelerated growth this decade under Clearway Group (54.91% of voting shares, 42.12% economic interest), which is owned by TotalEnergies SE ( TTE ) and Blackrock/GIP. The company plans to announce Q4 results Feb. 21. Current guidance is for 7.5% to 12% compounded annual growth for cash available for distribution (CAFD) through 2027, with 5% to 8% dividend growth. That\u2019s off a yield recently close to 6%. The primary fuel for growth is drop-down acquisitions of fully contracted renewable energy assets developed by Clearway Group. Those now include five gigawatts of generation assets co-located with data centers. Over the past 12 months, Clearway-contracted solar output has increased by more than 60%. Overall renewable energy generation is up 27%. The two largest ongoing expansion efforts are a 500-megawatt solar-plus-storage facility in Texas expected to reach commercial operation in 2025, and a drop down of 320 MW of \u201cstorage hybridization\u201d projects entering service in 2026. The company also owns an increasingly valuable portfolio of natural gas generation that\u2019s vital to California\u2019s power grid. These assets could be sold at a lucrative price in coming years. In the meantime, they\u2019re a reliable source of cash flow, balancing off changeable wind and solar conditions.

That\u2019s a good place to be right now, with investors generally wary of renewable energy stocks following US elections. With Clearway posting solid results, it\u2019s only a matter of time before investors lose their fear and this stock takes out its all-time high in the mid-30s.

Energy, Inc. (CWEN) Is Among the Best Environmental Stocks to Invest in Right Now? Mashaid Ahmed Thu, Jan 2, 2025, 11:55 AM 5 min read In This Article: CWEN-A -0.73% We recently published a list of the 10 Best Environmental Stocks To Invest In Right Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Clearway Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CWEN ) stands against the other best environmental stocks to invest in right now. The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29), held in Baku, Azerbaijan, concluded on November 24, with a landmark agreement that sets a new collective goal for climate finance. The agreement, which aims to triple the annual finance to developing countries from the previous goal of $100 billion to $300 billion by 2035, marks a significant step forward in global efforts to combat climate change and support vulnerable nations. Furthermore, this new finance goal, known as the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) also aims to scale up collaboration among all actors including governments, private sector entities, and international financial institutions to finance developing countries to reach $1.3 trillion annually by 2035. The progress made at COP29 builds on the global climate action achieved at previous conferences. COP27 established a historic Loss and Damage Fund, while COP28 delivered a global agreement to transition away from all fossil fuels in energy systems swiftly and fairly, tripling renewable energy and boosting climate resilience. The new finance goal at COP29 is a crucial step in ensuring that these commitments are met and that the global community remains on track to limit global warming. According to a report by McKinsey, the $300 billion annual goal for climate financing falls drastically short of the estimated $1 trillion needed annually to meet global targets. On a broader scale, McKinsey estimates that up to $9 trillion per year will be required globally by 2050 to decarbonize physical assets and transition towards a sustainable future. The report highlights that private capital is widely seen as a key enabler in bridging this financing gap. However, many investors remain cautious, not just due to a lack of funds, but due to a shortage of credible, scalable investment opportunities, execution challenges, insufficient risk management, and delays in scaling operations. The geopolitical and macroeconomic environment further complicates the sustainability landscape. Higher interest rates, inflation, and energy supply disruptions have created an environment where cost assumptions from just a few years ago no longer hold true. In light of these dynamics, McKinsey identifies three key strategies for businesses to navigate the complex investment landscape in sustainability. First, companies must reevaluate and refresh sustainability strategies as past assumptions may no longer be valid, and companies must take a pragmatic approach to align their strategies with current realities. Second, businesses must accelerate climate technology industrialization. While renewable energy technologies have made significant progress in cost competitiveness, other emerging technologies, such as hydrogen, long-duration energy storage, and precision fermentation, require further industrialization. Third, companies must address execution risks, streamline supply chains, and ensure they have experienced teams capable of managing large-scale sustainable projects. Story Continues The report concluded by emphasizing that companies who will act decisively, embrace innovative financing mechanisms, and prioritize operational excellence will not only contribute to global sustainability goals but also position themselves for future growth in an evolving economic landscape. The journey towards a sustainable future requires collaboration, innovation, and accountability across all sectors. While the challenges are significant, the opportunities for growth, resilience, and value creation are even greater.

Clearway Energy (CWEN) One of the Best Renewable Energy Stocks to Buy Now? Mashaid Ahmed Tue, Dec 31, 2024, 8:50 PM 6 min de lectura En este art\u00edculo: CWEN-A -0.73% We recently published a list of the 11 Best Renewable Energy Stocks To Buy Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Clearway Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CWEN ) stands against the other best renewable energy stocks to buy now. The future of President Joe Biden\u2019s landmark climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) plays a significant role in promoting renewable energy by offering a wide range of tax incentives and funding mechanisms to encourage investment in clean energy technologies, including solar, wind, and geothermal power, hangs in the balance as the incoming Republican-controlled White House, Senate, and House of Representatives prepare to take office in 2025. However, an area of concern is the future of the Department of Energy\u2019s Loan Programs Office (LPO), which provides financing for green energy projects. The LPO has been instrumental in funding large-scale renewable energy projects and it expanded significantly under the IRA. However, Trump\u2019s appointees, particularly Wright, who has expressed skepticism about the climate crisis, may be inclined to scale back or dismantle this program entirely, which could have a significant impact on the green energy sector.

Renewables as the Key to Meeting Rising Demand In an interview with Bloomberg on December 23, Tom Steyer, Co-Founder of Galvanize Climate Solutions, a climate-focused global investment firm, discussed the role of renewable energy in the United States. Steyer emphasized that while the year 2025 is often discussed in the context of climate regulations, it is more accurately about meeting the growing energy demand. He argued that renewable energy should be at the center of any energy bill, regardless of political persuasion. Steyer highlighted that market costs are the primary drivers of the energy transition to renewables. He cited the fact that in 2023, 86% of new electricity generation was predominantly from renewable sources, driven by economic rather than purely environmental considerations. Steyer pointed out that the phrase \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d might still be part of the political conversation, but the cost differential between renewable and fossil fuels drives the reality. He noted that renewables are now cheaper than fossil fuels and are becoming increasingly cost-effective. For instance, the cost of natural gas in the U.S. has risen to nearly double its previous levels, while in Europe, it is even higher. However, the cheapest electricity is increasingly coming from renewable sources, both in the U.S. and globally. This economic reality is driving business decisions, international competitiveness, and national security by industries such as tech, that require large amounts of electricity and are increasingly turning to renewables to meet their energy needs. Leer m\u00e1s When asked about the potential impact of deregulation in the energy sector, Steyer suggested that deregulation could help accelerate the adoption of renewables if it includes faster permitting and lower oversight for all energy projects, including renewables. He noted that the Trump administration\u2019s push for faster permits and reduced oversight for oil and gas drilling could extended to renewables, and will lead to a significant expansion of low-cost, abundant renewable energy. Regarding nuclear energy, Steyer acknowledged its potential but noted the challenges associated with cost, safety, and public perception. He pointed out that nuclear energy has historically been expensive, with the last nuclear plant in Georgia costing at least four times its original estimate. While nuclear energy could provide a stable baseload power source, the high costs and safety concerns have made it a less attractive option compared to renewables. As the United States enters 2025, the future of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) remains uncertain under a Republican government. However, the cost-effectiveness of renewable energy compared to fossil fuels makes it increasingly dominant in the global energy mix. Why Clearway Energy, Inc.

{"text": "3 Top High-Yield Stocks to Buy Before 2024 Is Over Matt DiLallo, Neha Chamaria, and Reuben Gregg Brewer, The Motley Fool Sun, Dec 22, 2024, 4:41 PM 6 min read In This Article: BEP -4.34% EPD +1.47% CWEN-A -0.73% ^GSPC -0.76% The dividend yield on the average stock has fallen over the past year due to the surge in the stock market. For example, the S&P 500 's dividend yield has declined from 1.6% a year ago to around 1.2% these days, which is near its lowest level in over 20 years. However, some stocks still offer higher-yielding dividends . Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) , Clearway Energy (NYSE: CWEN) (NYSE: CWEN.A) , and Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEP) (NYSE: BEPC) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors as great stocks to buy as we head into the new year. Here's why they're great income stocks to buy right now. Enterprise Products Partners is built to pay you well Reuben Gregg Brewer (Enterprise Products Partners): How about buying an investment-grade-rated energy company with a shockingly reliable business and a 6.5% yield?\u00a0If that sounds good to you, then you may want to buy North American midstream giant Enterprise Products Partners before 2024 is over. From a business perspective, this high-yielder owns the energy infrastructure that helps move oil and natural gas around the world. The energy sector couldn't operate without the pipelines, storage, transportation, and processing assets Enterprise owns. And its customers are happy to pay the fees necessary to use Enterprise's infrastructure, making the master limited partnership (MLP) a simple toll-taker business. The big takeaway -- volatile commodity prices aren't the main driver of financial results. This is a big part of the reason it has been able to reliably increase its distribution for 26 consecutive years. Throw in an investment-grade-rated balance sheet\u00a0and the fact that distributable cash flow covers the distribution by around 1.7 times, and there's a lot of room for adversity before a distribution cut would be a material risk. Sure, the lofty yield will make up most of an investor's return here, but Enterprise does have around $6.9 billion in capital investment projects underway and the size to act as an industry consolidator. Slow and steady distribution growth looks likely to continue for years to come from this high yielder. The power to grow its dividend in 2025 and beyond Matt DiLallo (Clearway Energy ): Clearway Energy currently offers investors a 6.5% dividend yield. That's a hefty payout compared to the S&P 500 , which yields around 1.2%. The clean energy infrastructure owner is having another solid year. It's on track to meet or exceed its guidance of generating $395 million of cash available for distribution (CAFD) this year. That has given it the power to increase its dividend by 7% over the course of the year, hitting its goal of delivering dividend growth toward the high end of its 5% to 8% annual target range. Story Continues Clearway has already lined up a lot of growth for 2025 and beyond. It expects previously funded investments to grow its CAFD to $420 million at the mid-point of its target range. That should enable it to increase its dividend by about 6.8% over the next year. The company already has more growth lined up for 2026 and is building toward 2027. It has secured several new investments in renewable energy projects that will enter commercial service over the next year and has started securing new contracts for its natural gas-fired power plants. These initiatives should help grow CAFD per share at a 7.5% to 12.5% compound annual rate in the 2026 to 2027 timeframe from next year's baseline. That should support another 6.5% increase in the dividend in 2026 and growth toward the lower end of its target range the following year. Beyond 2027, Clearway sees the potential to continue growing its CAFD and dividend at a mid- to high-single-digit annual rate as it continues investing in new renewable energy assets. Given its already high yield, Clearway has the potential to produce high total returns in the coming years as it grows its CAFD and dividend payments . That combination of yield and growth makes it look like a great income stock to buy before this year is over. Lots more dividend growth ahead Neha Chamaria (Brookfield Renewable) : Shares of Brookfield Renewable have significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in 2024. Still, Brookfield Renewable has big growth plans, is steadily growing its funds from operations (FFO), and is sending out bigger dividend checks to its shareholders year after year. Brookfield Renewable grew its FFO per unit by around 7% during the nine months that ended Sept. 30 and expects to grow it by more than 10% in the full year, backed by its recent acquisitions and development projects. In fact, 2024 will be the company's strongest year for investments in growth as it continues to steadily raise cash to invest from two sources: cash-flow growth and proceeds from the sale of mature assets. In 2024 alone, Brookfield Renewable expects to commission 7 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity, a record for the company. Its total development pipeline soared to a whopping 200 GW at the end of the third quarter. Brookfield Renewable expects to grow its pipeline even further in 2025 and 2026 and believes it should be able to grow its annual FFO per unit by 10% or more over the next five years and beyond. For investors, Brookfield Renewable's FFO growth should translate into bigger dividends. The company expects to grow its annual dividend by 5% to 9%. Couple that with a high dividend yield -- its corporate shares currently yield 5.1%, while units of the partnership yield 6.3% -- and Brookfield Renewable looks like a solid dividend stock to buy before 2024 draws to a close. Note that purchasing corporate shares can help investors in the U.S. avoid filing a K-1 tax form and foreign tax withholding. Should you invest $1,000 in Enterprise Products Partners right now?

Energy Stocks to Buy Now? Mashaid Ahmed Tue, Dec 24, 2024, 6:17 PM 5 min read In This Article: CWEN-A -0.73% We recently published a list of 10 Best Solar Energy Stocks To Buy Now . In this article, we are going to look at where Clearway Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CWEN ) stands against other best solar energy stocks to buy now. During Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, the U.S. solar industry experienced a significant boost, primarily driven by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This $369 billion package, signed into law in 2022, has been a game-changer for the renewable energy sector. The IRA provided substantial incentives for renewable energy, including tax credits, grants, and investments in clean energy infrastructure. The IRA has also reduced the U.S. reliance on imported energy resources. The economic benefits of the IRA have been widely recognized, with bipartisan support from both Democratic and Republican leaders. According to a report by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) published on December 4, the US solar market installed 8.6 GW of capacity in Q3, continuing the trend of record-setting quarterly volumes this year and marking a notable 21% increase compared to the same quarter in the prior year. The report also highlights significant growth in domestic solar module manufacturing capacity, which increased by over 9 GW in Q3, reaching nearly 40 GW. This marks a substantial rise from less than 7 GW at the end of Q2 2022, before the introduction of domestic manufacturing and procurement tax credits under the IRA. Additionally, the first US cell manufacturing facility opened in Q3 marking a significant milestone in reshoring cell production for the first time since 2019. Utility-scale solar remained the largest contributor, with 6.6 GW installed in Q3, which signifies a 44% increase year-over-year and marks the highest third-quarter performance on record for the segment. Solar\u2019s Future Under Trump As Donald Trump prepares for a second term as president, the future of the U.S. solar industry is a topic of significant interest. Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric has signaled intentions to bolster the fossil fuel industry, repeal Biden-era policies such as the IRA, and increase trade tariffs. In an interview with CNBC on November 9, John Berger, CEO of Sunnova, discussed the impact of a potential second Trump administration on the solar industry. Berger emphasized that the market is currently driven by wild speculation and emotional responses, but he believes that the fundamentals of the solar industry remain strong and the demand for energy is increasing, suggesting it could bring even more success and growth for the solar industry and his company. Story Continues Berger addressed the speculation about future policy changes, particularly regarding the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). He stated that the IRA is unlikely to change significantly, noting its success and the bipartisan support for domestic manufacturing, especially in the production of solar panels, batteries, inverters, and electric vehicles. He also stated that 85% of the plants that manufacture solar panels and batteries are located in Republican districts. Berger concluded by praising the IRA, particularly the tax credit for manufacturing (45X), which has played an instrumental role in growing and building domestic manufacturing plants in the U.S. Despite the potential for federal policy changes, the solar industry will undoubtedly play an increasingly vital role in global energy systems.

Signs Binding Agreement to Acquire 137 MW Wind Project Clearway Energy, Inc Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 1:26 AM 11 min read In This Article: CWEN -0.39% CWEN-A -0.73% Clearway Energy, Inc PRINCETON, N.J., Nov. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Clearway Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CWEN, CWEN.A) (\u201cCompany\u201d) today announced that it has entered into a binding agreement to acquire the operational Tuolumne Wind Project from Turlock Irrigation District. Tuolumne Wind Project is a 137 MW wind project located in Klickitat County, WA that achieved commercial operations in 2009. The project will sell power under a new PPA with Turlock Irrigation District, an investment-grade regulated entity, with an initial contract term of 15 years to 2040. In conjunction with the acquisition, the Company also has received from Turlock Irrigation District a contractual extension option to enable a potential future repowering of the project. After factoring in estimated closing adjustments and new non-recourse project-level debt, the Company expects its total long-term corporate capital commitment to acquire the project to be approximately $70-75 million, which the Company expects to fund with existing sources of liquidity. Based on current expected terms and conditions of the new non-recourse financing, the acquisition is expected to provide incremental annual levered asset CAFD on a five-year average basis of approximately $9 million beginning January 1, 2026. The Company expects the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2025, after which its targeted contribution to fiscal year 2025 results will be communicated. \u201cClearway continues its successful track record of executing accretive, third-party acquisitions. We look forward to providing clean, reliable electricity to Turlock Irrigation District and its customers for years to come. Additionally, this transaction, along with other recent investments, underscores Clearway\u2019s expanding presence in Western states alongside our historical core in California, contributing further to our strong incumbency in these attractive markets for clean power,\u201d said Craig Cornelius, Clearway Energy, Inc.\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. \u201cWe are also pleased to note that this acquisition is the next step in our path to meeting our long-term financial objectives, including our goal to deliver the midpoint or better of $2.40 to $2.60 in CAFD per share in 2027.\u201d About Clearway Energy, Inc.

Contacts: Investors: Media: Akil Marsh Zadie Oleksiw investor.relations@clearwayenergy.com media@clearwayenergy.com 609-608-1500 202-836-5754 Appendix Table A-1: Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution Reconciliation The following table summarizes the calculation of Estimated Cash Available for Distribution and provides a reconciliation to Net Income/(Loss): ($ in millions) 5-Year Average 2026 - 2030 Net Income $ 7 Interest Expense, net 8 Depreciation, Amortization, and ARO Expense 17 Adjusted EBITDA 32 Cash interest paid (8 ) Cash from Operating Activities 24 Maintenance Capex (1 ) Principal amortization of indebtedness (14 ) Estimated Cash Available for Distribution $ 9 Non-GAAP Financial Information EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Cash Available for Distribution (CAFD) are non-GAAP financial measures. These measurements are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that Clearway Energy\u2019s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. EBITDA represents net income before interest (including loss on debt extinguishment), taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is presented because Clearway Energy considers it an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes debt and equity holders frequently use EBITDA to analyze operating performance and debt service capacity. EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: EBITDA does not reflect cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments; EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on debt or cash income tax payments; Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and Other companies in this industry may calculate EBITDA differently than Clearway Energy does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to use to invest in the growth of Clearway Energy\u2019s business. Clearway Energy compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally. See the statements of cash flow included in the financial statements that are a part of this news release. Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a further supplemental measure of operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for mark-to-market gains or losses, non-cash equity compensation expense, asset write offs and impairments; and factors which we do not consider indicative of future operating performance such as transition and integration related costs. The reader is encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons Clearway Energy considers it appropriate for supplemental analysis. As an analytical tool, Adjusted EBITDA is subject to all of the limitations applicable to EBITDA. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, the reader should be aware that in the future Clearway Energy may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this news release. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods. This measure is widely used by investors to measure a company\u2019s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. Additionally, Management believes that investors commonly adjust EBITDA information to eliminate the effect of restructuring and other expenses, which vary widely from company to company and impair comparability. As we define it, Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for the effects of impairment losses, gains or losses on sales, non-cash equity compensation expense, dispositions or retirements of assets, any mark-to-market gains or losses from accounting for derivatives, adjustments to exclude gains or losses on the repurchase, modification or extinguishment of debt, and any extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring items plus adjustments to reflect the Adjusted EBITDA from our unconsolidated investments. We adjust for these items in our Adjusted EBITDA as our management believes that these items would distort their ability to efficiently view and assess our core operating trends. In summary, our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis and to readily view operating trends, as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations, and in communications with our Board of Directors, shareholders, creditors, analysts and investors concerning our financial performance. Cash Available for Distribution A non-GAAP measure, Cash Available for Distribution is defined as of September 30, 2024 as Adjusted EBITDA plus cash distributions/return of investment from unconsolidated affiliates, cash receipts from notes receivable, cash distributions from noncontrolling interests, adjustments to reflect sales-type lease cash payments and payments for lease expenses, less cash distributions to noncontrolling interests, maintenance capital expenditures, pro-rata Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated affiliates, cash interest paid, income taxes paid, principal amortization of indebtedness, changes in prepaid and accrued capacity payments, and adjusted for development expenses. Management believes CAFD is a relevant supplemental measure of the Company\u2019s ability to earn and distribute cash returns to investors. We believe CAFD is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because securities analysts and other interested parties use such calculations as a measure of our ability to make quarterly distributions. In addition, CAFD is used by our management team for determining future acquisitions and managing our growth. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to CAFD is cash provided by operating activities. However, CAFD has limitations as an analytical tool because it does not include changes in operating assets and liabilities and excludes the effect of certain other cash flow items, all of which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results from operations. CAFD is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered an alternative to cash provided by operating activities or any other performance or liquidity measure determined in accordance with GAAP, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. In addition, our calculations of CAFD are not necessarily comparable to CAFD as calculated by other companies. Investors should not rely on these measures as a substitute for any GAAP measure, including cash provided by operating activities.

Clearway Energy, Inc. (NYSE:CWEN.A) Suggests It's 49% Undervalued editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 9:57 PM 6 min read In This Article: CWEN -0.39% CWEN-A -0.73% Key Insights Clearway Energy's estimated fair value is US$53.08 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Clearway Energy's US$27.00 share price signals that it might be 49% undervalued Analyst price target for CWEN.A is US$33.58 which is 37% below our fair value estimate Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Clearway Energy, Inc. ( NYSE:CWEN.A ) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex. We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model . See our latest analysis for Clearway Energy Is Clearway Energy Fairly Valued? We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$467.3m US$261.0m -US$199.0m US$744.0m US$796.2m US$841.6m US$881.8m US$918.3m US$952.0m US$984.0m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x2 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 7.02% Est @ 5.70% Est @ 4.78% Est @ 4.13% Est @ 3.68% Est @ 3.36% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.9% US$429 US$220 -US$154 US$529 US$520 US$505 US$486 US$465 US$442 US$420 (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$3.9b After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.9%. Story Continues Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$984m\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (8.9%\u2013 2.6%) = US$16b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = US$16b\u00f7 ( 1 + 8.9%) 10 = US$6.9b The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$11b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$27.0, the company appears quite good value at a 49% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. NYSE:CWEN.A Discounted Cash Flow November 26th 2024 The Assumptions We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Clearway Energy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.522. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for Clearway Energy Strength Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry. Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market. Weakness Interest payments on debt are not well covered. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market. Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value. Threat Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow. Dividends are not covered by earnings. Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market. Looking Ahead: Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

Mashaid Ahmed Wed, Dec 11, 2024, 9:37 PM 5 min read In This Article: CWEN-A -0.73% We recently published a list of 10 Best Alternative Fuel Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to look at where Clearway Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CWEN ) stands against other best alternative fuel stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The alternative fuel and renewable energy industry is currently one of the fastest-growing sectors globally. Examples of alternatives include wind, solar, nuclear, hydropower, and biofuel energy. According to the Business Research Company, the global alternative fuel or renewable energy market was valued at $1.10 trillion in 2024 and is projected to reach $1.55 trillion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 8.8%. Growing environmental concerns and stringent environmental regulations in many developed countries have significantly boosted the renewable energy sector, leading to an increase in installed capacity for renewable sources. The increasing power demand and energy consumption are also key drivers of the growing demand in the alternative or renewable fuels industry. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global energy demand is expected to increase by 3.4% annually by 2026, with 85% of this additional demand coming from China and India. India\u2019s electricity demand alone is predicted to grow by over 6% annually until 2026, driven by economic growth and rising air conditioning use. Southeast Asia is also expected to see a 5% annual increase in electricity demand through 2026. In the United States, a moderate rise in electricity demand is anticipated in the coming years, primarily driven by data centers. The electricity consumption by data centers, artificial intelligence, and cryptocurrency could potentially double to 1,000 TWh by 2026. The IEA forecasts that the surge in electricity generation from low-emission sources will meet global demand growth over the next three years, with renewable energy expected to surpass coal as the leading energy source by early 2025.

Uncertainty in U.S. Alternative Energy Market On November 11, Reuters reported that hedge funds rapidly increased their investments in bank stocks, marking the fastest pace in three years, while simultaneously reducing their holdings in renewable energy companies, according to a note from Goldman Sachs. This shift in investment strategy came in response to Donald Trump\u2019s win in the U.S. presidential election. Financial stocks, including banks, have become the most favored and most net-purchased sector on Goldman\u2019s prime brokerage trading desk. Story Continues Additionally, hedge funds placed long bets on consumer finance, capital markets, and financial services companies, with a focus on US stocks and equities in developing Asia and Europe, where they exited short positions and added long ones. In contrast, utility companies, especially independent power, and renewable electricity producers faced heavy selling, with hedge funds taking two short positions for every long position in U.S. utility companies. Despite short-term challenges, the rapid growth and increasing investment in alternative fuel and renewable energy reflects a global shift towards sustainable and environmentally friendly energy solutions. As renewable technologies continue to advance and become more cost-effective, they are increasingly becoming the preferred choice for new energy projects worldwide. Why Clearway Energy, Inc.

Here Are 3 Great Energy Stocks to Buy Right Now. Matt DiLallo, Neha Chamaria, and Reuben Gregg Brewer, The Motley Fool Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 2:16 PM 6 min read In This Article: BEP -4.34% NEE-PT +0.49% CWEN-A -0.73% The energy industry has reached a major inflection point. It was already slowly transitioning to cleaner energy sources to combat the potentially worse impacts of climate change. Now, demand for electricity is on track to accelerate in the coming years, powered by the electrification of transportation and increased digitalization, including an expected surge in demand by power-hungry artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. Given that outlook, several energy stocks look like compelling buys these days. Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC) (NYSE: BEP) , Clearway Energy (NYSE: CWEN.A) (NYSE: CWEN) , and NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors as the best ones to buy for those with $1,000 to invest right now. Here's why they like that trio the best. Are You Missing The Morning Scoop? Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb Brookfield Renewable is being opportunistic like always Reuben Gregg Brewer (Brookfield Renewable): A strange pair of trends is taking shape at Brookfield Renewable. On the one hand, it is selling assets at prices it thinks are attractive. On the other hand, it is using the proceeds from those sales to buy investments it thinks are attractively priced. The confounding fact here is that both assets are in the same sector: clean energy. That's not as odd as it sounds. After a period in which Wall Street was willing to fund just about anything related to clean energy, the sector is now facing much more difficult financial constraints. Financially strong businesses are doing fine and are still attractive, while financially weak businesses are being left on the discount pile. Brookfield is selling well-capitalized, cash-generating clean energy businesses and buying weak ones, which is really just an extension of the opportunistic approach it has always taken. Once in-house, Brookfield uses its investment-grade-rated balance sheet to recapitalize troubled businesses. It also works to improve its operating performance based on its long history of success in the clean energy space. It's not rocket science; Brookfield Renewable is simply leaning into its business strengths. And that's leading to strong performance for investors, noting that funds from operations (FFO)\u00a0grew 11% year over year in the third quarter of 2024. But since Wall Street's excitement over clean energy has waned, long-term investors can collect a yield as high as 5.6% by buying Brookfield Renewable and its opportunistic exposure to a growing piece of the broader energy industry. Story Continues Extending its growth outlook Matt DiLallo (Clearway Energy ): Clearway Energy made a brilliant move a few years ago. The clean energy infrastructure company cashed in on the value of its thermal assets, selling them to private equity giant KKR for over $1.3 billion in net proceeds. It has been recycling that capital into higher-returning renewable energy investments ever since. The company has committed to investing all the proceeds from that sale into deals that should close in the coming quarters, giving it a lot of visibility into its growth over the next few years. Clearway expects to generate about $2.08 per share of cash flow available for distribution (CAFD) next year. That should support dividend growth toward the upper end of its 5% to 8% annual target range. Meanwhile, it expects to grow its CAFD per share by 7.5% to 12.5% in 2026 as the balance of its secured investments enters commercial service. That should support another 6.5% dividend increase in 2026. Meanwhile, Clearway Energy has increasing visibility into its growth in 2027 and beyond. It believes it can grow its CAFD per share at a 5% to 8%+ annual rate starting in 2027, which should support dividend growth in the bottom half of its target range while keeping its payout ratio within a reasonable range (70%-80%). The company can support its longer-term growth with retained cash after paying dividends and its solid balance sheet. Given the tremendous need for new renewable energy developments, there should be no shortage of investment opportunities. Clearway Energy currently pays a 6%-yielding dividend, implying that a $1,000 investment could generate $60 (and growing) of dividend income each year. Add that to its mid- to high-single-digit earnings growth rate, and Clearway could easily produce double-digit total annual returns in the coming years. This stock has solid long-term growth potential Neha Chamaria (NextEra Energy): The Department of Energy (DOE) projects U.S. demand for power will grow by 15% to 20% over the next decade. The DOE also expects clean energy resources to meet the rising demand for electricity. One company stands to benefit from both trends, making it a great energy stock to buy now -- NextEra Energy. NextEra Energy is not only the largest utility in the U.S. but also the world's largest producer of wind and solar energies and a leader in battery storage. Management knows NextEra Energy can capitalize on the massive opportunities of rising power demand and clean energy growth and has already outlined plans to invest nearly $100 billion between 2024 and 2027. That's a huge investment that is expected to more than double NextEra Energy's renewables and storage capacity by 2027. Management expects adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to grow by 6% to 8% through 2027 and dividend per share to grow by nearly 10% through 2026. NextEra Energy has generated strong returns for shareholders over the past couple of decades, growing its adjusted EPS and dividend by nearly 9% and 10%, respectively, between 2003 and 2023. That growth has translated into solid returns for shareholders over the years, and I expect the trend to continue.
