Buy, Hold, or Sell? 1 / 2 WM Earnings Miss Estimates in Q4, Revenues Appreciate 13% Y/Y Zacks Equity Research Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 6:41 PM 3 min read Waste Management, Inc. WM has remained stagnant over the past 10 months, showing no stock price growth, while the industry posted a modest 2.7% gain. The company\u2019s performance lags behind key competitors such as Republic Services RSG, which experienced a 12% rise, and Clean Harbors CLH, which surged 24% during the same period. Given the consolidation, let's explore the factors shaping WM\u2019s performance and evaluate whether this is an opportune moment to invest in the company. Waste Management, Inc. Price Waste Management, Inc. price | Waste Management, Inc. Quote WM: Sustainability, Stability and Growth Combined Over the years, WM has shown consistent revenue growth. The company's business model is recession-resistant because waste management is an essential service, regardless of economic conditions. WM\u2019s robust waste collection, recycling and disposal infrastructure creates a steady revenue stream, making it a dependable investment option during market fluctuations. Additionally, WM has embraced sustainability initiatives and innovation, such as converting landfill gas into renewable energy, which solidifies its growth prospects and positions it as a leader in the green economy. These efforts align with global shifts toward environmentally responsible practices, attracting ESG-focused investors. Its steady financial performance appeals to risk-averse investors looking for long-term stable returns. WM's revenues and operating income have both grown at a compound annual growth rate of 5.7% from 2019 to 2023. WM's focus on pricing and cost control is key to maintaining healthy profit margins. By carefully managing expenses, optimizing routes and improving operational processes, the company reduces unnecessary costs while providing high-quality services. This approach also ensures that price adjustments are justified and aligned with market demand, protecting margins even in fluctuating economic conditions. WM emphasizes enhancements in service delivery and operational efficiency. By integrating modern technology and process improvements, the company reduces costs and boosts service reliability and customer satisfaction. WM\u2019s Reliable Dividend Payout Waste Management has demonstrated a remarkable commitment to rewarding its shareholders, maintaining a consistent dividend payment record since 1998. This consistency has continued despite fluctuations in the company\u2019s cash position, underscoring its dedication to creating long-term value for investors. It has paid $970 million, $1.1 billion, and $1.14 billion in dividends during 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Story Continues The Stericycle Acquisition Waste Management recently acquired Stericycle. The company anticipates that the acquisition will be accretive to its earnings and cash flows within one year of closing, with more than $125 million in annual run-rate synergies. Stericycle holds a leading position in the growing medical waste industry. The acquisition adds complementary business platforms to enhance WM\u2019s comprehensive waste and environmental solutions. WM Stock Seems Overvalued While WM\u2019s growth prospects are promising, its current valuation appears elevated. The stock is trading at a trailing 12-month Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio of 15.11X, which is above the industry average of 12.88X. The forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio for WM stands at 3.3X compared to the industry average of 2.6X. WM: A Clear Hold Recommendation WM remains a solid long-term investment option due to its consistent revenue growth, robust dividend payouts, and focus on sustainability. The company\u2019s recession-resistant business model and strategic acquisitions enhance its competitive edge and growth potential. However, WM\u2019s stock is currently consolidating and still appears overvalued, with valuation metrics exceeding industry averages. While near-term upside may be limited, WM\u2019s steady performance and ability to weather economic fluctuations make it a dependable choice for risk-averse investors. Holding the stock allows investors to benefit from its long-term stability and dividends while awaiting better entry points for additional investments. WM currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Preferred Stock Dividend Payments CareCloud, Inc Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 3:00 PM 10 min read In This Article: CCLD CCLDO CCLDP CareCloud, Inc Accelerated Timeline Reflects Strong Financial Performance and Commitment to Shareholder Value SOMERSET, N.J., Jan. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CareCloud, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) (Nasdaq: CCLD, CCLDO, CCLDP), a leader in healthcare information technology and generative AI solutions for medical practices and health systems nationwide, today announced that its Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) has decided to resume dividend payments on its Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the \"Series A Preferred Stock\") and Series B Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the \"Series B Preferred Stock\") earlier than previously announced based on the Company\u2019s success at accelerating free cash flow. \u201cWe are thrilled to have reached this important milestone ahead of schedule and we want to express our sincerest thanks to our shareholders for their strong support,\u201d said Stephen Snyder, Co-Chief Executive Officer of CareCloud. \u201cWe expect an exciting 2025 as we continue to achieve our profitability and free cash flow targets, while focusing on pivoting toward growth.\u201d Current Redemption Value For purposes of illustration only, if the Company exercised its redemption right today, holders of Series A Preferred Stock would be entitled to approximately $28.17 per share representing the redemption value of $25 and the accumulated dividends of $3.17. Also, for purposes of illustration only, if the Company exercised its redemption right today, holders of Series B Preferred Stock would be entitled to approximately $28.43 per share representing the current redemption price of $25.75 (comprised of the $25 stated value and a $.75 fee for early redemption) and the accumulated dividends of $2.68. The underlying details regarding the foregoing are more set forth below. They are also contained in the descriptions of our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, which are contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d). Dividends Declared for January and February 2025 The Board has declared dividends for January and February 2025. For Series A Preferred Stock, the dividends are calculated at an effective monthly rate of 1/12th of 11%, which includes catch-up payments to account for the months when Series A dividends accumulated at 11% per annum, prior to our Series A Preferred Stock shareholders' decision in September 2024 to reduce the dividend rate to 8.75% per annum. After paying the dividends for January and February, the Board intends to continue paying monthly dividends at the higher effective rate of 11% per annum (inclusive of catch-up payments) for approximately 8 additional months before reducing the monthly dividend to 1/12 of 8.75% per annum. For Series B Preferred Stock, the dividends are based on an effective monthly rate of 1/12th of 8.75% per annum. Story Continues Declared dividends per share for the months of January and February 2025 are set at $0.18229 for each month payable on February 18, 2025 and March 17, 2025, respectively. A Series A Preferred Stock catchup payment of $0.04688 per share is also included during each of these months, payable on February 18, 2025 and March 17, 2025, respectively. Similarly, declared dividends for Series B Preferred Stock are set at $0.18229 for January and February 2025, payable on February 18, 2025 and March 17, 2025, respectively. For January, the ex-dividend date is January 30, the record date is January 31, and the payment date is February 18, 2025. For February, the ex-dividend date is February 27, the record date is February 28, and the payment date is March 17, 2025. Additional Details regarding the Preferred Stock Holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock for the month of January 2025 are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 8.75% per annum of the $25 per share liquidation preference (equivalent to $2.1875 per annum per share). Because (1)\u00a0any dividend payments made on either the Series\u00a0A Preferred Stock or Series\u00a0B Preferred Stock must first be credited against the earliest accumulated but unpaid dividend due with respect to such preferred stock and (2)\u00a0for such period, the cash dividend rate for the Series\u00a0A Preferred Stock was 11% per annum, rather than the current rate of 8.75% per annum, the Board authorized an additional payment equal to 2.25% per share of Series A Preferred Stock. Holders of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 8.75% per annum of the $25 per share liquidation preference (equivalent to $2.1875 per annum per share). Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock are cumulative and payable monthly on the 15 th day of each month; provided that if any dividend payment date is not a business day, then the dividend may be paid on the next succeeding business day. Dividends are payable to holders of record on the applicable record date, which shall be the last day of the calendar month, whether or not a business day.

This Article: ARIS ABM WM PESI Environmental and Facilities Services Q3 Earnings: Aris Water (NYSE:ARIS) is the Best in the Biz Earnings results often indicate what direction a company will take in the months ahead. With Q3 behind us, let\u2019s have a look at Aris Water (NYSE:ARIS) and its peers. Many environmental and facility services are non-discretionary (sports stadiums need to be cleaned after events), recurring, and performed through longer-term contracts. This makes for more predictable and stickier revenue streams. Additionally, there has been an increasing focus on emissions and water conservation over the last decade, driving innovation in the sector and demand for new services. Despite these tailwinds, environmental and facility services companies are still at the whim of economic cycles. Interest rates, for example, can greatly impact commercial construction projects that drive incremental demand for these services. The 14 environmental and facilities services stocks we track reported a slower Q3. As a group, revenues were in line with analysts\u2019 consensus estimates while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 1.7% above. Amidst this news, share prices of the companies have had a rough stretch. On average, they are down 7.2% since the latest earnings results. Best Q3: Aris Water (NYSE:ARIS) Primarily serving the oil and gas industry, Aris Water (NYSE:ARIS) is a provider of water handling and recycling solutions. Aris Water reported revenues of $112.3 million, up 12.5% year on year. This print exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations by 8.6%. Overall, it was an exceptional quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 sales volume and EBITDA estimates. \u201cAris had an exceptional third quarter as we continued to grow our produced water volumes, increased our recycled water sales, and maintained our strong margins. As we anticipated, our capital investment to support these increased activity levels was primarily deployed in the first half of the year and our capital spending in the third quarter declined significantly. We continue to experience steady volume growth and increasing cash generation. We anticipate a strong finish to the year and are extremely proud of our team\u2019s efforts and results,\u201d said Amanda Brock, President and CEO of Aris.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Clean Harbors, Inc. Price Clean Harbors, Inc. price | Clean Harbors, Inc. Quote Key Growth Drivers of CLH Growing industrial activity, stricter environmental laws and the rising importance of corporate sustainability are tailwinds for Clean Harbors' business growth. Since industries nowadays prioritize environmental compliance and waste management solutions, CLH\u2019s expertise in hazardous waste disposal and environmental cleanup is highly sought in the manufacturing, healthcare and energy sectors. The company benefits from long-term service contracts, providing recurring revenues and stable cash flows. CLH\u2019s revenues have increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.7% from 2019 to fiscal 2023. Operating cash increased at a CAGR of 12.2% during this period. CLH\u2019s acquisition strategy enhances its service portfolio and geographical reach. Past acquisitions have successfully driven revenue and market share growth. The 2023 acquisition of Thompson Industrial Services expanded the Environmental Services segment's industrial service operations in the southeastern region of the United States. In 2022, Clean Harbors acquired two privately owned businesses. They strengthened the waste oil collection and re-refining operations of the Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions segment, expanding CLH\u2019s presence in the southern United States. CLH's solid cash reserves contribute to its strong liquidity. The current ratio at the end of the third quarter of 2024 was pegged at 2.1, higher than the industry average of 1. A\u00a0current ratio of more than 1\u00a0often indicates that the company will be easily paying off its short-term obligations. The times interest earned ratio of 5.3X has been coming down over the past year but remains well above the industry\u2019s 4.7X. So, there is no trouble servicing its debt.

January 2, 2025 The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B), The Home Depot, Inc. (HD) and Pfizer Inc. (PFE), as well as a micro-cap stock AMREP Corp. (AXR). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today. You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>> Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry over the past year (+24.0% vs. +23.8%). The company is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies with numerous diverse business activities. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts and is indicative of its financial flexibility. Continued insurance business growth fuels an increase in float, drives earnings and generates maximum return on equity. The non-insurance businesses have also been doing well in the last few years. The addition of Pilot Travel Centers (PTC) has strengthened its energy business. A sturdy capital level provides further impetus. However, exposure to cat loss induces earnings volatility and also affects underwriting results. Huge capital expenditures remain a headwind. With the demise of Charles Munger, uncertainty looms over the company's performance. (You can read the full research report on Berkshire Hathaway here >>> ) Shares of Home Depot have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Home Furnishings industry over the past six months (+18.5% vs. +17.9%). The company\u2019s stock prices is driven by a recovery in top-line trends supported by sales from the SRS acquisition. The company delivered better-than-expected sales and EPS in third-quarter fiscal 2024, with year-over-year sales growth fueled by gains in certain seasonal categories due to favorable weather and hurricane-related demand. Home Depot gains from its \u201cOne Home Depot\u201d investment plan focused on expanding supply chain facilities, enhancing technology, and improving the digital experience. HD is also advancing efforts to build a robust Pro ecosystem. HD raised its sales and EPS view for fiscal 2024, citing strong third-quarter results and projected hurricane-related demand in Q4. However, comparable sales and EPS remain impacted by higher interest rates and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. (You can read the full research report on Home Depot here >>> ) Pfizer\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-4.3% vs. +0.9%). The company\u2019s revenues from Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 products are declining due to lower demand. Pfizer also expects a significant impact from the loss of patent exclusivity in the 2026-2030 period, as several of its key products face patent expirations. However, Pfizer\u2019s non-COVID operational revenue growth improved in the first three quarters of 2024, driven by its key in-line products like Vyndaqel and Eliquis, new launches and newly acquired products from Seagen. Huge profits from its COVID products strengthened its cash position, which is being used to make acquisitions, increase dividends, buy back shares and reduce debt. Seagen\u2019s acquisition has strengthened its position in oncology. Continued growth in non-COVID sales and significant cost-reducing measures should drive profit growth. (You can read the full research report on Pfizer here >>> ) Shares of AMREP have outperformed the Zacks Real Estate - Development industry over the past year (+44.3% vs. -8.3%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $166.03 million has achieved impressive financial growth in fiscal 2025, with fiscal second-quarter revenues up 34.5% to $11.9 million and net income soaring 264.8% to $4 million. First-half revenues rose 61.9% to $30.9 million, driven by operational efficiency and favorable market conditions. Strategic land holdings in New Mexico position AMREP to benefit from rising housing demand amid easing monetary policies, declining mortgage rates and limited supply, supporting long-term growth. Favorable macro trends and resilient housing prices drive profitability. Risks include geographic concentration, market volatility, affordability challenges, reliance on the real estate market and elevated input costs. Regulatory changes, competition and economic uncertainty could impact performance, but AMREP\u2019s operational efficiency and strong margins mitigate these risks.

Harbors, Inc. (NYSE:CLH) Maintain Its Strong Returns? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sat, Dec 21, 2024, 3:08 PM 3 min read In This Article: CLH One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Clean Harbors, Inc. ( NYSE:CLH ). Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Clean Harbors How Do You Calculate Return On Equity? The formula for ROE is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Clean Harbors is: 16% = US$417m \u00f7 US$2.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024). The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.16 in profit. Does Clean Harbors Have A Good ROE? One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Clean Harbors has a higher ROE than the average (11%) in the Commercial Services industry . NYSE:CLH Return on Equity December 21st 2024 That's clearly a positive. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. Our risks dashboard should have the 2 risks we have identified for Clean Harbors. How Does Debt Impact ROE? Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking. Combining Clean Harbors' Debt And Its 16% Return On Equity Clean Harbors clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.10. While its ROE is respectable, it is worth keeping in mind that there is usually a limit as to how much debt a company can use. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it. Story Continues Conclusion Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt. Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company . But note: Clean Harbors may not be the best stock to buy . So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt. Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Harbors (CLH) Up 11.4% Since Last Earnings Report? Zacks Equity Research Fri, Nov 29, 2024, 7:31 PM 4 min read In This Article: CLH A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Clean Harbors (CLH). Shares have added about 11.4% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500. Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Clean Harbors due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts. Clean Harbors' Q3 Earnings Miss Estimates Clean Harbors reported mixed third-quarter 2024 results, wherein earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues beat the same. CLH\u2019s earnings of $2.1 per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.4% but increased 26.2% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s actual. Total revenues of $1.5 billion surpassed the consensus estimate by 1.3% and increased 12% on a year-over-year basis. CLH's Segmental Revenues Environmental Services\u2019 (ES) revenues of $1.3 billion grew 13.2% from the year-ago quarter, meeting our estimate. Strong demand for disposal and recycling services due to record volumes of containerized waste and positive pricing momentum has driven this segment\u2019s revenues. Revenues from Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (SKSS) amounted to $232.1 million, increasing 5.9% on a year-over-year basis and beating our estimate of $230.9 million. Clean Harbor's Profitability Performance Adjusted EBITDA of $301.8 million grew 18.4% from the year-ago quarter and missed our projection of $303.6 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.7%, up 100 basis points from the year-ago quarter. Strength in the ES segment is expected to have driven the margin Segment-wise, adjusted EBITDA for ES amounted to $332.5 million, increasing 15.1% year over year. The figure missed our estimate of $339.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA for SKSS was $41.2 million, up 32.4% from the year-ago quarter and outpacing our estimate of $44.9 million. Balance Sheet & Cash Flow of CLH Clean Harbors exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $513.4 compared with $402 million at the end of the preceding quarter. Inventories and supplies were $376.6 million compared with $365.4 million in the second quarter of 2024. Long-term debt (less current portion) was $2.8 billion, flat with the previous quarter. CLH generated $239.2 million in net cash from operating activities. The capital expenditure amounted to $96.8 million. The adjusted free cash flow utilized was $144.5 million. CLH's 2024 Guidance For 2024, Clean Harbors\u2019 guidance for adjusted EBITDA was lowered to $1.100-$1.120 billion compared with the $1.125-$1.165 billion given in the previous quarter. The adjusted free cash flow guidance was reduced to $280-$320 million from the $350-$390 million provided in the preceding quarter. CapEx is projected to be $410-$440 million. Story Continues How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then? In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision. The consensus estimate has shifted -23.57% due to these changes. VGM Scores At this time, Clean Harbors has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy. Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in. Outlook Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Clean Harbors has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months. Performance of an Industry Player Clean Harbors is part of the Zacks Waste Removal Services industry.

(CLH): Analysts Are Bullish on This Waste Management Stock Neha Gupta Fri, Nov 22, 2024, 6:13 PM 7 min read In This Article: CLH We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Waste Management Stocks to Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Clean Harbors, Inc. (NYSE:CLH) stands against the other waste management stocks. The waste management industry is experiencing robust growth as industrialization and urbanization gather steam. Positive trends in government regulations and the use of advanced technologies in waste management are also fueling growth. According to Grand View Research the industry was valued at $1.29 trillion in 2022 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5.4%\u00a0 from 2023 to 2030. The growth is expected to gather pace due to stringent government regulations pertaining to resource conservation and waste shipment regulation to improve service delivery. Escalating waste volumes from medical facilities industries to residential settings due to urbanization are also expected to impact the sector positively. The sector is also supported by factors such as the growth of smart cities and the rising use of integrated waste management systems.

The surge in hazardous waste is one of the factors strengthening the prospects of waste management companies. America has consistently topped the charts as the most wasteful country in the world, with over 239 million metric tons of garbage every year. While most people might perceive it as a threat to the environment and society,\u00a0 it presents a massive opportunity for waste management companies. \u201cIt\u2019s a profitable industry,\u201d according to Debra Reinhart, a Board of Scientific Counselors member for the EPA. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult industry, but it is profitable if it\u2019s done right.\u201d Consequently, advanced waste disposal methods and techniques have emerged as a result of growing awareness about proper waste disposal to preserve the health of humans and animals. Waste management companies must dispose of or recycle waste on time due to the presence of large quantities of hazardous compounds, including metals and salts. The growing demand for efficient solid waste management frameworks and strategies that prioritize public security and economic development is a welcome for waste management companies.\u00a0 For starters, it\u2019s made it possible for companies to hike prices for their services, citing their efficient solid waste management systems. The price increases have resulted in robust revenue growth and improved profit margins, allowing waste management companies to generate more shareholder value. Story Continues As long as there are people and companies who see trash as a resource rather than waste, the solid waste management sector will only keep growing. As governments worldwide agitate for a safe environment free of hazardous or other waste materials, companies engaged in waste management will always record booming business. Similarly, as the US economy steers from recession following the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates for the second time, booming industrial activity is expected, resulting in more waste generated by factories. Likewise, consumer purchasing power has also been boosted, given the low interest rates in play, which should result in more waste volume due to increased spending on various items. Consequently, waste management companies are on the cusp of booming business due to higher waste volumes. With most hiking prices amid limited opposition, now would be the best time to closely watch the best waste management stocks to buy as they are well poised to generate long-term value. Our Methodology To compile the list of the best waste management stocks to buy according to analysts, we scanned the stock market for companies engaged in all kinds of waste management. We then settled on waste management stocks that Wall Street analysts believe are well poised to explode backed by solid underlying fundamentals. Upon analyzing hedge fund sentiment and holdings, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on their upside potential, as of November 22. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ( see more details here ). A truck filled with hazardous waste being safely unloaded at a recycling facility. Clean Harbors, Inc. (NYSE: CLH ) Market cap as of November 22, 2024: $13.48 Billion Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44 Stock Upside Potential: 7.47% Clean Harbors, Inc. (NYSE:CLH) is a waste management company that collects, transports, treats and disposes hazardous and non-hazardous waste. It also deals in landfill disposal and wastewater treatment. The stock has outperformed the overall market by a 46.52% year-to-date gain, attributed to its strong market position and successful adaptation to sector demands. The outperformance in the first half of the year was fueled by high demand in the Environmental service segment. Clean Harbors, Inc. (NYSE:CLH) also benefited from the contributions of its recent acquisition, HEPACO. The outperformance continued in the third quarter as the company delivered profitable growth in its operating segments on October 30, 2024. Revenue in the quarter grew 12% year over year to $1.53 billion as income from operations increased 25% to $192.3 million. Net income was up 26% to $115.2 million. The strong performance comes from the Environmental Services (ES) segment's underlying demand remaining strong. Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions' (SKSS) segment results showed softer-than-expected base oil and lubricant demand and pricing throughout the quarter, with a more significant decline in September despite higher Adjusted EBITDA. Consequently, the company expects its full-year EBITDA to range between $1.10 billion and $1.12 billion, representing 10% year-over-year growth. It also expects free cash flow to range between $280 million and $320 million. Here is what Merion Road Capital said about Clean Harbors, Inc. (NYSE:CLH) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter : \u201cDuring the quarter, I uncharacteristically built a position from nothing into our top holding. Clean Harbors, Inc. (NYSE:CLH) is the largest US hazardous waste management company. Before digging into CLH, I would like to diverge with a bit of personal history. In my early 20s, I worked at Macquarie Bank, where our team was responsible for acquiring investments on behalf of our managed infrastructure funds and the bank\u2019s balance sheets. One of my first assignments was the acquisition of a publicly traded municipal solid waste (MSW) management company (Waste Industries). While not technically infrastructure per-se, MSW has similar characteristics like being an essential service, operating regional monopolies, and controlling scarce assets. In any case, we paid something like 8-9x EBITDA, which was a premium to the then trading multiple. Waste Industries is now a small part of GFL Environmental, which trades at 12x EBITDA. And GFL is actually at a notable discount to its peers of Waste Management, Republic Services, and Waste Connections, which are at 15x. While hindsight is 20/20, buying into this asset class 15 years ago would have been a home run given their strong cash flow and multiple expansions. Overall CLH ranks 6th on our list of the best waste management stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of CLH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.
