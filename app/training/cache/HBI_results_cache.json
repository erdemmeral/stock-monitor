Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Release Date: January 24, 2025 For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript. Positive Points Amber Enterprises India Ltd ( NSE:AMBER ) reported a robust quarterly performance with a 65% increase in revenue, reaching INR2,133 crores. Operating EBITDA almost doubled, showing a 97% growth to INR162 crores, and PAT improved significantly to INR37 crores from a loss of INR1 crore in the previous year. The Consumer Durable division saw a blended growth of 67%, driven by a 71% increase in the Room Air Conditioner (RAC) segment. The Electronics division experienced remarkable growth, with revenue increasing by 96% to INR472 crores and EBITDA growing by 193% to INR34 crores. Amber Enterprises India Ltd ( NSE:AMBER ) revised its revenue growth guidance for the Electronics division from 45% to 55% for FY25, indicating strong future prospects. Negative Points The Railway Subsystem and Defense division reported a muted quarter with a 13% decline in revenue due to delays in product offtake. The profitability of the Railway Subsystem and Defense division was impacted by delays and expansion expenses, with expectations to normalize only by H2 of FY26. Gross margins in the RAC segment declined by 106 basis points, attributed to product mix changes. There are capacity constraints in the Electronics division, particularly in the Accent segment, which could impact short-term growth. The company faces potential supply chain disruptions, particularly in the compressor segment, which could affect future production if not resolved. Story Continues Q & A Highlights Q : Can you explain the decline in gross margins for the RAC segment and the growth in RAC components? A : The gross margin impact is largely due to the product mix, which varies from product to product. However, the components business, specifically RAC components, is picking up alongside the RAC segment, showing good growth in the current quarter and over the nine months. Q : What factors led to the upward revision of guidance for the Electronics division from 45% to 55%? A : The Electronics division has expanded its applications beyond consumer durables to telecom, smart meters, and automotive sectors. This diversification, along with the growth potential in the SM circuit, has led to the revised guidance. We are confident in maintaining more than 55% growth in this vertical. Q : How is the RAC segment performing, and what are the expectations for the upcoming season? A : The RAC segment grew by 71% due to converting gas charging customers to ODM solutions and the completion of new factories by brands. The industry is expected to grow by 25% this year, with anticipation of good summers leading to inventory ramp-up. We expect to grow in line with the industry, potentially outpacing it due to new customer additions. Q : What is the status of the Railway Subsystem and Defense division, and when do you expect margins to normalize? A : The division faced delays due to structural changes in projects like the Gujarat Express and Mumbai Metro. These projects are now back on track, and we expect margins to return to the 18%-22% range by H2 of FY26, with growth resuming next year. Q : Can you provide details on the JV with Korea Circuit and the expected CapEx? A : We are awaiting the finalization of the electronic component scheme by the government. The JV will focus on HBI, flex, and semiconductor substrates, with an expected CapEx of INR1,000 crores plus. We anticipate approvals by September next year, with significant incentives from both central and state governments.

Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 12:06 PM 3 min read In This Article: HBI +1.01% 3 Reasons to Avoid HBI and 1 Stock to Buy Instead The past six months have been a windfall for Hanesbrands\u2019s shareholders. The company\u2019s stock price has jumped 58.1%, hitting $8.33 per share. This was partly due to its solid quarterly results, and the performance may have investors wondering how to approach the situation. Is now the time to buy Hanesbrands, or should you be careful about including it in your portfolio? Get the full breakdown from our expert analysts, it\u2019s free . Despite the momentum, we're cautious about Hanesbrands. Here are three reasons why HBI doesn't excite us and a stock we'd rather own. Why Do We Think Hanesbrands Will Underperform? A classic American staple founded in 1901, Hanesbrands (NYSE: HBI) is a clothing company known for its array of basic apparel including innerwear and activewear. 1. Declining Constant Currency Revenue, Demand Takes a Hit Investors interested in Apparel and Accessories companies should track constant currency revenue in addition to reported revenue. This metric excludes currency movements, which are outside of Hanesbrands\u2019s control and are not indicative of underlying demand. Over the last two years, Hanesbrands\u2019s constant currency revenue averaged 8.4% year-on-year declines. This performance was underwhelming and implies there may be increasing competition or market saturation. It also suggests Hanesbrands might have to lower prices or invest in product improvements to accelerate growth, factors that can hinder near-term profitability. Hanesbrands Constant Currency Revenue Growth 2. New Investments Fail to Bear Fruit as ROIC Declines ROIC, or return on invested capital, is a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity). We typically prefer to invest in companies with high returns because it means they have viable business models, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is often what surprises the market and moves the stock price. Over the last few years, Hanesbrands\u2019s ROIC has decreased. Paired with its already low returns, these declines suggest its profitable growth opportunities are few and far between. Hanesbrands Trailing 12-Month Return On Invested Capital 3. High Debt Levels Increase Risk Debt is a tool that can boost company returns but presents risks if used irresponsibly. As long-term investors, we aim to avoid companies taking excessive advantage of this instrument because it could lead to insolvency. Hanesbrands\u2019s $3.57 billion of debt exceeds the $317.3 million of cash on its balance sheet. Furthermore, its 7\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio (based on its EBITDA of $483.7 million over the last 12 months) shows the company is overleveraged. Story Continues Hanesbrands Net Debt Position At this level of debt, incremental borrowing becomes increasingly expensive and credit agencies could downgrade the company\u2019s rating if profitability falls. Hanesbrands could also be backed into a corner if the market turns unexpectedly \u2013 a situation we seek to avoid as investors in high-quality companies. We hope Hanesbrands can improve its balance sheet and remain cautious until it increases its profitability or pays down its debt. Final Judgment Hanesbrands doesn\u2019t pass our quality test. After the recent surge, the stock trades at 14.9\u00d7 forward price-to-earnings (or $8.33 per share). At this valuation, there\u2019s a lot of good news priced in - we think there are better investment opportunities out there. We\u2019d recommend looking at one of our top digital advertising picks .

Months: Should You Buy the Dip? Anindya Barman Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 11:00 PM 6 min read In This Article: CLF -0.56% STLD -1.64% Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. CLF shares have lost 33.6% in the past six months, underperforming the Zacks Mining \u2013 Miscellaneous industry\u2019s decline of 7.2%. The bearishness is partly due to the underlying challenges in the steel industry as reflected by the significant retreat in U.S. steel prices due to a combination of demand slowdown and oversupply, which have triggered a downward revision in CLF\u2019s earnings estimates. CLF is currently trading at a roughly 56% discount to its 52-week high of $22.97 reached on April 4, 2024. Technical indicators show that CLF has been trading below the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) since April 30, 2024. The stock is also trading below the 50-day SMA since Dec. 4, 2024.\u00a0 Following a death crossover on June 13, 2024, the 50-day SMA continues to read lower than the 200-day SMA, indicating a bearish trend. CLF\u2019s Shares Trade Below 50-Day SMA Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Given the significant pullback in Cleveland-Cliffs\u2019 shares, investors might be tempted to snap up the stock. But is this the right time to buy CLF? Let\u2019s find out. Vertically Integrated Profile & Competitive Strength Aid CLF Cleveland-Cliffs is the largest producer of iron ore pellets in North America and the region's biggest flat-rolled steel producer. The acquisition of AK Steel Holding Corporation, completed in March 2020, allowed CLF to become a vertically integrated steel company. Its vertically integrated footprint, starting from mining to the production of high-value finished steel products, provides it with a competitive advantage in supplying automotive and other steel end markets. As a leading supplier of automotive-grade steel in the United States, Cleveland-Cliffs\u2019 automotive steel business remains the fulcrum of its primary competitive strength. CLF benefits from its competitive strength by leveraging the ability to source its primary steelmaking feedstock, iron ore pellets, as well as scrap and hot-briquetted iron (HBI) domestically and internally at a stable cost vis-\u00e0-vis its peers that largely depend on imported pig iron whose supply has been disrupted amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Stelco Buyout Bolsters CLF\u2019s Steelmaking Capabilities Cleveland-Cliffs, in November 2024, closed its buyout of Stelco Holdings Inc. The acquisition enhances CLF\u2019s steelmaking capabilities, doubling its exposure to the flat-rolled spot market and leveraging cost advantages in raw materials, energy, healthcare and currency. Stelco's integration diversifies CLF\u2019s customer base across construction and industrial sectors, generating synergies in procurement, overhead and public company-related expenses. CLF is expected to benefit from the contributions of shipments from Stelco starting fourth-quarter 2024. Story Continues Cost Cuts to Yield Margin Benefits for Cleveland-Cliffs Cleveland-Cliffs is executing cost-cutting initiatives, leading to reduced steel-making expenses. In 2023, the company achieved an $80 per ton reduction in costs aided by decreased input costs and increased productivity. CLF also realized a $40 per ton sequential decline in unit costs in the third quarter of 2024, driven by improved operational efficiencies. It is expected to continue to benefit from reduced steel unit costs in the fourth quarter, partly aided by Stelco. Weaker Steel Prices Weigh on CLF\u2019s Prospects CLF, like most U.S. steel producers, is hamstrung by the significant downward correction in steel prices, which has largely contributed to the stock's downward slide. U.S. steel prices declined sharply in 2024 due to a slowdown in end-market demand and oversupply after a strong run in late 2023 that extended into early 2024. The benchmark hot-rolled coil (HRC) prices tumbled more than 40% last year from $1,200 per short ton at the start of 2024. The downside has been influenced by a concoction of factors, including a pullback in steel mill lead times, an oversupply of steel exacerbated by increased imports, reduced demand from key industries and economic uncertainties. Sluggish industrial production and construction activities also contributed to the decline. The price slump led to lower profitability for steel producers.\u00a0 While the recent steel mill price hikes have led to a modest uptick in HRC prices, a significant recovery is not expected in the near term, given the weak manufacturing backdrop and demand weakness. Prices are currently hovering around the $700 per short ton level. A slowdown in global automotive production curtailed steel consumption in this key end-market in 2024. The construction sector experienced a slowdown in the United States due to high interest rates, which dampened steel demand in this market. Elevated borrowing costs and inflation took a bite out of the residential construction industry. Manufacturing activities also weakened amid softening demand for goods and higher borrowing costs. Cleveland-Cliffs\u2019 Earnings Estimates Going Down The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 for CLF has been revised downward over the past 60 days. The consensus estimate for the fourth quarter of 2024 has also been revised lower over the same time frame. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings is currently pegged at a loss of 67 cents, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 162.6%. Earnings are expected to register a decline of 900% in the fourth quarter. Find the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research CLF Stock Underperforms Industry & S&P 500 CLF\u2019s price performance has been lackluster, partly reflecting the broader industry challenges triggered by a significant decline in steel prices. Its shares have lost 44.1% over the past year, underperforming the industry\u2019s 11.5% decline and the S&P 500\u2019s rise of 24.7%. The stock has also underperformed its major U.S. steel-making peers, with Steel Dynamics, Inc. STLD gaining 8%, while Nucor Corporation NUE and United States Steel Corporation X declining 26.7% and 23.6%, respectively. CLF\u2019s One-year Price Performance Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research How Should Investors Play the CLF Stock? Cleveland-Cliffs benefits from its vertically integrated footprint, competitive strength and cost-saving actions. The Stelco buyout also reinforces its steelmaking capabilities and expands its exposure to the flat-rolled spot market. Despite these positives, CLF is exposed to the choppiness in the steel space, which has led to its underperformance. A significant pullback in steel prices coupled with declining earnings estimates, cast a pall on the company's prospects. Therefore, it is not advisable to buy the dip in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Holding onto the CLF stock will be prudent for investors who already own it.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 5 Growth Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

And now, I would like to turn the microphone over to TSMC's CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, for the summary of operations and the current quarter guidance. Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the fourth quarter of 2024. Story Continues After that, I will provide the guidance for the first quarter of 2025. Fourth quarter revenue increased 14.3% sequentially in NT, supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies. Gross margin increased by 1.2 percentage points sequentially to 59%, mainly reflecting a higher capacity utilization rate and productivity gains, partially offset by the dilution of 3-nanometer ramp-up. With operating leverage, total operating expenses accounted for 10% of net revenue. Thus, operating margin increased by 1.5 percentage points sequentially to 49%. Overall, our fourth quarter EPS was TWD 14.45 and ROE was 36.2%. Now let's move on to revenue by technology. 3-nanometer process technology contributed 26% of wafer revenue in the fourth quarter. Five-nanometer and 7-nanometer accounted for 34% and 14%, respectively. Advanced technologies, defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 74% of wafer revenue. On a full year basis, 3-nanometer revenue accounted for 18% of 2024 wafer revenue; 5-nanometer, 34%; 7-nanometer, 17%. Advanced technologies accounted for 69% of total wafer revenue, up from 58% in 2023. Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. HPC increased 19% quarter over quarter to account for 53% of our fourth quarter revenue. Smartphones increased 17% to account for 35%. IoT decreased 15% to account for 5%. Automotive increased 6% to account for 4%. DCE decreased 6% to account for 1%. On a full year basis, HPC increased 58% year on year. Smartphone, IoT, automotive, DCE increased 23%, 2%, 4%, and 2%, respectively, in 2024. Overall, HPC accounted for 51% of our 2024 revenue. Smartphone accounted for 35%. IoT accounted for 6%, and automotive accounted for 5%. Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 2.4 trillion or USD 74 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by TWD 184 billion, mainly due to the increase of TWD 71 billion in accounts payable, an increase of TWD 99 billion in accrued liabilities and others. In terms of financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days declined by 1 day to 27 days, while inventory days decreased by 7 days to 80 days primarily due to shipment of N3 and N5 wafers. Regarding cash flow and capex. During the fourth quarter, we generated about TWD 620 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 362 billion in capex, and distributed TWD 104 billion for the first quarter '24 cash dividend. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 241 billion to TWD 2.1 trillion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our fourth quarter capital expenditures totaled TWD 11.2 billion. Now, let me recap our performance in 2024. Due to the strong demand for our 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer process technologies, we continue to outperform the foundry industry in 2024. Our revenue increased 30% in U.S. dollar terms to USD 90 billion or increased 33.9% in NT to TWD 2.89 trillion. Gross margin increased 1.7 percentage points to 56.1%, mainly reflecting improvements in overall capacity utilization, partially offset by 3-nanometer dilution and higher electricity costs. With operating leverage, our operating margin increased 3.1 percentage points to 45.7%. Overall, full year EPS increased 39.9% to TWD 45.25 and ROE increased 4.1 percentage points to 30.3%. On cash flow, we spent USD 29.8 billion or TWD 956 billion in capex, generated TWD 1.8 trillion in operating cash flow and TWD 870 billion in free cash flow. We paid TWD 363 billion in cash dividends in 2024, up 24.5% year over year. I've finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our current quarter guidance. We expect our business in the first quarter to be impacted by smartphone seasonality, partially offset by continued growth in AI-related demand. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our first quarter revenue to be between USD 25 billion and USD 25.8 billion, which represents a 5.5% sequential decline or a 34.7% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 32.8, gross margin is expected to be between 57% and 59%, operating margin between 46.5% and 48.5%. Regarding tax rate. Our effective tax rate was 16.7% in 2024. For 2025, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 16% and 17%. This concludes my financial presentation. Now, let me turn to our key messages. I will start by talking about our fourth quarter '24 and first quarter '25 profitability. Compared to third quarter, our fourth quarter gross margin increased by 120 basis points sequentially to 59%, primarily due to a higher capacity utilization rate and productivity gains, partially offset by dilution from the continued ramp-up of our 3-nanometer technology. We have just guided our first quarter gross margin to decrease by 100 basis points to 58% at the midpoint. This is primarily due to ramp-up costs associated with N2 and CoWoS expansion and the start of dilution from our overseas fabs. As a reminder, six factors determine TSMC's profitability: leadership, technology, development and ramp-up, pricing, cost reduction, technology mix, capacity utilization, and foreign exchange rate. Looking at full year 2025, given the 6 factors, there are a few puts and takes I would like to share. On the one hand, we are working hard to increase our value. The dilution impact from our N3 ramp is expected to gradually reduce. And we expect our overall utilization rate to moderately increase in 2025. On the other hand, as we have said before, we forecast 2% to 3% margin dilution impact from the ramp-up of our overseas fabs. The impact is less than 100 basis points in the first quarter of '25, but we expect it to grow more pronounced throughout the year as our fabs in Kumamoto and Arizona ramp up. We also expect inflationary costs, including higher electricity prices in Taiwan to impact our gross margin by at least 1% in 2025. In addition, there are some ramp-up costs associated with N2 and further conversion of N5 to N3 capacity, which, together, we expect to impact our gross margin by about 1%. Finally, we have no control over the foreign exchange rate, but that may be another factor in 2025. Longer term, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate and considering our global manufacturing footprint expansion plans, we continue to forecast a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable. Next, let me talk about our 2025 capital budget and depreciation. Every year, our capex is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in the future years, and our capex and capacity planning is based on the long-term market demand profile. At TSMC, a higher level of capital expenditures is always correlated with higher growth opportunities in the following years. In 2024, we spent USD 29.8 billion as we continue to invest to support our customers' growth. With our strong technology leadership and differentiation, we are well-positioned to capture the multiyear structured demand from the industry megatrends of 5G, AI, and HPC. In 2025, we expect our capital budget to be between USD 38 billion and USD 42 billion as we invest to capture the future growth. Out of the USD 38 billion to USD 42 billion capex for 2025, about 70% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies. About 10% to 20% will be spent for specialty technologies. And about 10% to 20% will be spent for advanced packaging, testing, mask making, and others. Our depreciation expense is expected to increase by high single-digit percentage year over year in 2025 as newly incurred depreciation will be partially offset by other notes rolling off depreciation even as we invest for the future growth. With this level of capex spending in 2025, we remain committed to delivering profitable growth to our shareholders. We also remain committed to a sustainable and steadily increased cash dividend per share on both an annual and quarterly basis. Now, let me turn the microphone over to C. C. C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, everyone. First, let me start with the conclusion of 2024 and our 2025 outlook. 2024 was a mixed year of recovery for the global semiconductor industry. AI-related demand was shrunk, while other applications, so only a very mild recovery as macroeconomics conditions weigh on consumer sentiment and market demand. Concluding 2024, the Foundry 2.0 industry, which we define as all logical wafer manufacturing, packaging, testing, mask making and others, increased 6% year over year, slightly lower than our previous forecast. Supported by strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies, TSMC's revenue increased 30% year over year in U.S. dollar term, outperforming the foundry industry growth. Entering 2025, we expect fabless semiconductor inventory to have returned to a healthier level, exceeding 2024. We forecast a Foundry 2.0 industry to grow 10% year over year in 2025, supported by robust AI-related demand and a mild recovery in other end-market segment. Supported by our technology leadership with broader customer base, we are confident we can continue to outperform the industry growth. We expect 2025 to be another strong growth year for TSMC and forecast our full year revenue to increase by close to mid-20s percent in U.S. dollar terms. Now I will talk about the AI demand and TSMC's long-term growth outlook. We observed robust AI-related demand from our customers throughout 2024. Revenue from AI accelerators, which we now define as an AI GPU, AI6, and HBM controller for AI training and inference in the data center, accounted for close to mid-teens percent of our total revenue in 2024. Even after more than tripling in 2024, we forecast our revenue from AI accelerators to double in 2025 as the strong surge in AI-related demand continues. As a key enabler of AI applications, the value of our technology platform is increasing as customers rely on TSMC to provide the most advanced process and packaging technologies at scale in the most efficient and cost-effective way. To address the structural increase in the long-term market demand profile, TSMC is working closely with our customer to plan our capacity and investing in leading-edge specialty and advanced packaging technologies to support the growth. As we have said before, TSMC employs a disciplined and a rough capacity planning system to evaluate and judge the market demand to determine the appropriate capacity build. This is especially important when we have such high forecasted demand from AI-related business. At the same time, we are committed to earning sustainable and healthy return that enable us to continue to invest to support our customer growth while delivering profitable growth for our shareholders. Underpinned by our technology leadership and broader customer base, we now forecast the revenue growth from AI accelerators to approach a mid-40% CAGR for the five-year period starting off the already higher base of 2024. We expect AI accelerator to be the strongest driver of our HPC platform growth and the largest contributor in terms of our overall incremental revenue growth in the next several years. Looking ahead, as the world's most reliable and effective capacity provider, TSMC is playing a critical and integral role in the global semiconductor industry. With our technology leadership, manufacturing excellence, and customer trust, we are well-positioned to address the growth from the industry megatrend of 5G, AI, and HPC with our differentiated technologies. For the five-year period starting from 2024, we expect our long-term revenue growth to approach a 20% CAGR in U.S. dollar term, fueled by all four of our growth platforms, which are smartphone, HPC, IoT, and automotive. Next, let me talk about our global manufacturing footprint update. All our overseas decisions are based on our customers' need as they value some geographic flexibility and the necessary level of government support. This is also to maximize the value for our shareholders. In the U.S., we have a long-standing, good relationship with the U.S. government, dating back to even before our Arizona fab project announcement in May 2020. We have received a strong commitment and support from the U.S. customers and the U.S. federal state and city government and are making substantial progress. Building on the successful result of our earlier engineering wafer production, we were able to pull ahead the production schedule of our first fab in Arizona. Our first fab has already entered the high-volume production in 4Q '24, utilizing N4 process technology with a yield comparable to our fabs in Taiwan. We expect a smooth ramp-up process. And with our strong manufacturing capability and execution, we are confident to deliver the same level of manufacturing quality and reliability from our fab in Arizona as for our fab in Taiwan. Our plans for second fab and third fab in Arizona are also on track. This is where we'll utilize even more advanced technologies such as our N3, N2, and A16 based on our customers' need. TSMC will continue to play a critical and integral role in enabling our customers' success while remaining a key partner in enabling of the U.S. semiconductor industry. Next, in Japan, thanks to the strong support from the Japanese Central prefecture and local government, our progress is also very good. Our first specialty technology fab in Kumamoto has started volume production at the end of 2024 with a very good yield. Construction of our second fab specialty fab is scheduled to begin this year. In Europe, we have received strong commitment from the European Commission and the German Federal state and city government. We are progressing smoothly with our plans to build a specialty technology fab in Dresden, Germany, focusing on automotive and industrial application. In Taiwan, we continue to receive support from Taiwan government, and we are investing in and expanding our advanced technology and packaging capacities. Given the robust multiyear demand for our 3-nanometer technology, we continue to expand our 3-nanometer capacity in Taiwan Science Park. We are also preparing for multiple phases of 2-nanometer fabs in both Hsinchu and Kaohsiung Science Park to support the strong structural demand from our customers. We are also expanding our advanced packaging facilities across several locations in Taiwan. As we have said before, under today's fragmented globalization environment, overseas fab costs are higher for everyone, including TSMC and all other semiconductor manufacturers. We are leveraging our fundamental competitive advantage of manufacturing technology leadership and large-scale manufacturing base to be the most efficient and cost-effective manufacturer in the regions that we operate, while supporting our customers' growth. Finally, I will talk about the N2 and the A16 introduction. Our 2-nanometer and A16 technologies leads the industry in addressing the insatiable need for energy-efficient computing, and almost all the innovators are working with TSMC. We expect a number of the new technologies for 2-nanometer technology in the first 2 years to be higher than both 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer in their first 2 years, fueled by both smartphone and HPC applications. And to what delivered full on performance and power benefits with 10 to 15 speed improvement at the same power, or 20% to 30% power improvement at the same speed, and more than 15% chip density increase as compared with N3E. N2 is well on track for volume production in second half of 2025 as scheduled with the ramp profile similar to N3. With our strategy of continuous enhancement, we also introduced N2P as an extension of N2 family. N2P features further performance and power benefits on top of N2. N2P will support both smartphone and HPC applications, and volume production is scheduled for second half of 2026. We also introduced A16 future super power rail, or SPR, a separate offering. TSMC SPR is an innovative best-in-class backside power delivery solution that is first in the industry to incorporate a novel backside metal scheme that preserves a gate density and device with flexibility to maximize the product benefit. Compared with the N2, A16 provides a further 8% to 10% speed improvement at the same power, or 15% to 20% power improvement at the same speed, and additional 7% to 10% chip density gain. A16 is the best suitable for specific HPC product with complex signal route and dense power delivery network. Volume production is scheduled for second half of 2026. We believe N2, N2P, A16, and its derivative will further extend our technology leadership position and enable TSMC to capture the growth opportunity well into the future. This concludes our key message, and thank you for your attention. Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations Thank you, C.C. This concludes our prepared statements. Before we begin the Q&A session, I would like to remind everybody to please limit your questions to two at a time to allow all the participants an opportunity to ask their questions. Questions will be taken from both the floor and from the call. Should you wish to raise your question in Chinese, I will translate it to English before our management answers your question. [Operator instructions] Now we will begin the Q&A session. We'll take the first few questions here from the floor and then go to online. I think maybe left, middle, right. So, why don't we start? I think the first question, Gokul Hariharan from J.P. Morgan. Gokul Hariharan -- Analyst Thanks, Jeff. Happy New Year, management team. My first question is on the TSMC's U.S. future strategy. There have been a lot of changes recently. Taiwan relaxed the N-1 restriction. There was a news about that a week back. C. C., you met Elon Musk as well recently. So, you said there are a lot of developments that you've discussed. Your key IDM competitor seems to be struggling as well, while your Arizona fab seems to be ramping up quite well. So, in light of all these, I just wanted to understand the longer-term strategy. Would you start -- would you consider investing in latest node in the U.S.? Because so far, it has been N-1. Now you don't have the restriction from the Taiwan government to go and invest in the latest node. What has been your feedback in whatever discussions you have had with the incoming President Trump administration because they have talked a lot about CHIPS Act and everything, but they're also supportive. Your original investment was during President Trump's first term. And lastly, I think, Wendell, I think last time you had mentioned you're not very keen on taking over any IDM fabs. Has that thinking changed, especially given TSMC has the potential to become even more stronger partner for the U.S. in terms of bringing up U.S. local manufacturing? Sorry, long question. Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations Yes. OK. Thank you, Gokul. Indeed, a very long question. I think Gokul's question is looking at TSMC and our strategies in terms of global expansion, particularly in the U.S. He notes that Taiwan has recently relaxed or said they relaxed the N-1 rule. And C. C. has met several -- many of our large customers in the U.S. And our Arizona fab is ramping quite well. So, his question really is on the longer-term strategy, I believe, three parts. Number one, what is the feedback or sort of discussions ongoing with the next administration in the U.S.? Secondly, would we consider taking over IDM's fabs? Has that thinking changed? And last on the new node. Maybe we'll go one by one. C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer I almost forgot your question already. OK. First one, the technology node. Actually, it's not that we don't want to ramp up the same technology as in Taiwan. But if you look at the -- when we're ramping up, introduce a new technology into manufacturing, the fab is -- the process is so complicated. So, it should be very close to the R&D people. So, the initial phase of the ramping up always comes from the fab close to R&D. So, in that sense, we want to ramp up the same kind of technology in the U.S., but that practically is a little bit deep card. So, Taiwan will always be forced. Did that answer your question? It's not because of N-1 certification. No. It's practically, we just have to ramp up a new node in Taiwan. And the second, do we change our strategy to expand faster or something? Again, this is -- we always say that we build the capacity overseas is due to customers' needs. If my customer has a very high demand, what should I do? I build more fab, right, with the necessary government support, by the way, OK? Talking about the government. Let me assure you that we have a very frank and open communication with the current government and with the future one also. I cannot say anything more than that. OK. What -- Gokul Hariharan -- Analyst IDM fab. C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer That's my customer. And now, we -- again, our strategy is not based on my IDM competitors' status. They are our very good customers. I like them, and they are very important to TSMC's business also. That's all I can say. Thank you. Gokul Hariharan -- Analyst OK. Maybe my next question, going to gross margins. So, Wendell, we are almost approaching 60% gross margin. Last cycle, we peaked at about 60% toward the peak of the cycle. You are expecting the cycle to even strengthen based on guidance that C. C. provided for both AI, as well as some improvement in non-AI. So, how should we think about gross margins in this cycle? Is it realistic that we can get to more than 60% gross margin in this cycle? And related to that, could you help us understand specifically the U.S. fab, overseas fabs, but especially U.S. fab dilution? What are the key factors there? Because as you mentioned, yield is already approaching or almost close to Taiwan yield. So, is it basically cycle time is longer? Or is it that some other costs are much higher in the U.S. fab because new fab depreciation is probably fairly similar compared to the Taiwan fab? Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. So, Gokul's second question is on gross margin. Again, two parts. He noted gross margin is almost approaching 60%. In 2022, the last cycle, it was also around this type of level. We have said that this year is another very strong growth year for TSMC. So, this question is how should we think about gross margins in this current cycle? Can we approach or get to 60% or low 60s type of again? And then the second part is more specific to the U.S. in terms of the cost gap. What are the U.S. cost factors leading to the dilution impact? Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Gokul, first question on the gross margin. As we said, there are six factors affecting the profitability. Every year, different factors play different roles. But for example, if the utilization is extremely high, like last cycle, it is not impossible for us to reach what you just said. And secondly, the U.S. fab cost, it is more expensive in the U.S., mainly because of several reasons. Number one, the smaller scale, right? Now number two, the higher price in the supply chain; and number three, the very early stage of the ecosystem. So, if you add all these up, as we said, 2% to 3% dilution from our overseas fabs every year in the next five years. Gokul Hariharan -- Analyst If I use the 2% to 3% and do some math, it feels like the overseas fab is starting at, I don't know, 10% gross margin or 5% gross margin. Just adding factors, obviously, it's not how it works, but I'm just doing outside in. Is that right? Is that the right kind of ballpark in terms of thinking about margin? Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Chief Financial Officer All we can share is the 2% to 3%. Yeah. Gokul Hariharan -- Analyst I don't think TSMC has ever started a fab at 10% gross margin. C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Gokul, we are working hard to improve it. Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. Thank you, Gokul. We'll go to the middle, Laura Chen from Citigroup, Citibank. Laura Chen -- Citi -- Analyst Thank you and congratulations for the good results. I just want to have more details about your review. I mean I think people are kind of looking for your updated long-term CAGR growth. So, I believe that 20% starting from a very -- already very high base in 2024 is a really good long-term objective. But just wondering that aside from the strong AI demand, what's your view on the traditional applications like PC and the smartphone growth particularly for this year? Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. So, Laura's first question is looking -- she notes that we have updated our long-term CAGR to be approaching 20%, revenue growth in U.S. dollars, starting off even the high base of 24%. So, her question is, of course, AI demand is part of that, but what about smartphone and PC. And I think your question is specific to this year, C. C., 2025. C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer This year is still mild growth for PC and smartphone. But everything is AI related. So, you can start to see why we have the confidence to give you close to 20% CAGR in the next five years. AI, you look at a smartphone, they will put the AI functionality inside. And not only that, so the silicon content will be increased. In addition to that, actually, the replacement cycle will be shortened. And also they need to go into the very advanced technology because if you want to put a lot of functionality inside a small chip, you need a much more advanced technology to put those -- put it all together that even smartphone, the unit growth is almost low single digit, but then the silicon and the replacement cycle and the technology migration that give us more growth than just the unit growth, similar reason for PC. Laura Chen -- Citi -- Analyst So, we can kind of expect those AI-capable edge devices, they will be all based on 2-nanometer next year, perhaps second half? C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer Leading edge technology, that's why I say. Laura Chen -- Citi -- Analyst OK. Thank you. And also my next question is about AI. I noticed that this time, you include the HBM controller into your AI business revenues definition. So, can you provide us more update about what the HBI-based business opportunities could be? And previously, TSMC kind of announced cooperation with the key memories suppliers globally. Can you give us more details or updates on the progress of this business engagement? Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. Thank you, Laura. So, Laura's second question is on HBM controllers. She notes that our definition of AI accelerators includes memory controllers or HBM controllers. So, her question is, well, how do we see this opportunity? Or what is the opportunity for TSMC? And what is the progress of this working with our memory partners? C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer We are working with all the memory suppliers, all of them. And that's because TSMC is a large chip or logical technology, more advanced, and that means our customers' requirement. So, all of them are working with TSMC. Now we start to see some of the product coming out. But the high volume, probably you need to wait for another half of one year to see the high volume and big contribution to TSMC's revenue. Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. Thank you. We'll move to this side of the room. I guess we have Charlie Chan from Morgan Stanley Charlie Chan -- Analyst C. C., Wendell, and Jeff, first of all, Happy New Year. I think it's going to be a very exciting year, given your bullish outlook and also lots of news going on, right? So, let me start with overnight that U.S. seems to put a new framework on restricting China's AI business, right? So, I'm wondering whether that will create some business impact to your China business and how are you going to manage that. And also, for some chips in the middle, high performers like crypto mining, autonomous driving chip, do you think that count as a cloud AI? And would TSMC be able to continue to service your China customers? Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. Thank you, Charlie. So, Charlie's first question, if I may, sort of extrapolate or summarize is about the announcements of different types of U.S. export restrictions this week pertaining to China and AI-related chips. So, his question is, what is the impact to TSMC? How does it impact our business? C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer So, far, we look at -- we don't have at all analysis yet, but the first look is not significant, it's manageable. So, that meaning that my customers, who are being restricted or something, we are applying for a special permit for them. And we believe that we have confidence that they will get some permission so long as it's not in the AI area, OK, especially automotive, industry or even you talk about the crypto mining, yes. Charlie Chan -- Analyst Thank you. This is super helpful. And my second question is actually a very hot topic recently as well, the CPO. I think your main partner, Jensen came to Taiwan, this time probably besides meeting you, right, probably also want to enable this supply chain. So, based on your recent technology symposium, right, you already get ready for your COUPE or COUPE optical engine, but do you think the talent supply chain can really facilitate this CPO because without these key components, the next-generation ruling schedule could have some issues? So, I think this is the first part of the question is about how you're going to facilitate the CPO supply chain. And secondly, to TSMC, your foundry service, right, do you see significant upside with the optical networking migration to CPO because -- I ask this because there are some conventional products like optical transceiver DSP that could be replaced. Thank you. Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations Well, Charlie's second question is a very specific topic. He wants to know, well, if I can generalize because we certainly don't comment on customers or their products. But in terms of our progress on silicon photonics and CPO, how are we working with customers, how we're preparing as part of our advanced packaging solutions, and what are the opportunities for TSMC as optical moves to silicon photonics and other type of solutions on a general basis. C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer Charlie, that's a very technical question. Silicon photonics, we are working on it, as you said, and we got a good result also. However, a big volume, I don't think it will be in this year, or probably we'll wait for one or one and a half years till you can see the contribution of the volume production. The initial results are quite good, no doubt about it. And so, my customers are quite happy. Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. Thank you, C. C. Operator, we'll now move to the questions online. We'll take the first call from the online participant, please. Questions & Answers: Operator Yes. First question, Brett Simpson, Arete Research. Brett Simpson -- Arete Research -- Analyst Yeah, thanks very much. And can I just say, congratulations on reaching 100 billion in annual sales in Q4? It's quite a milestone. So, my first question is in Arizona. I think, Wendell, you mentioned that we're going to see some higher scale. So, can you update us on the status of Phase 2? It looks like the construction of this shell is nearly complete, but it would be great to understand more about how you see P2 developing over the course of 2025. And in terms of pricing U.S. wafers, how are you planning to do this? Will you have a U.S. price and a Taiwan price? Or are you more likely to have a global price regardless of where you make the wafers? Thank you. Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. So, Brett's first question is on Arizona, maybe split into two parts. First is in terms of -- we have already started the volume production of the first fab. So, Brett would like an update on the progress of the second fab in terms of the construction of the buildings and the shelves, etc. And then the second part would be on the pricing of overseas. As we say there's value to our customers. He wants to know do we charge a separate price. Or is it part of the overall pricing, etc., etc. C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer Let me answer the second question first. Do we charge a little bit higher? Yes, we did because we have a value of geographics of flexibility, right? And you guys know Made in U.S.A is a premium product. Yes, we discussed with our customers, and they are all agreed and happy to work with TSMC so that we can -- because of the cost structure over there, so it's a little bit higher price over there. The progress of the first fab is right now in volume production. Second fab we almost finished all the building and start to put the facility, etc. etc. And we expect that we move the tools this year also. And we have a plan that our third fab probably will start very soon, and we will announce it in the later days, OK? Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. Thank you, C.C. Brett, does that answer your first question? And do you have a second one? Brett Simpson -- Arete Research -- Analyst Yeah, very clear. And the second question, I wanted to get your perspective. Broadcom's CEO recently laid out a large SAM for AI hyperscalers building out custom silicon. I think he was talking about a million accelerated clusters from each of the customers he has in the next two or three years. What's TSMC's perspective on all this? I'm sure you've spent a lot of time verifying what hyperscalers are playing over the years to come. And how comfortable are you with the scale of what's being implied here? Thanks. Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. So, Brett's second question is looking at AI, I guess, specifically AI custom chips or ASICs. He notes that one of our customers recently laid out a very strong or large addressable SAM market for AI hyperscalers using custom silicon. Lots of them talking about clusters of 1 million chips. So, he wants to know what is TSMC's view, how do we see this trend in terms of AI ASICs as part of the AI demand megatrend. C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer Brett, I'm not going to answer the question of the specific number, but let me assure you that whether it's an ASIC or it's a graphic, they all need the very leading-edge technology, and they're all working with TSMC, OK? And the second one is, is the demand real was a number that my customers said. I will say that the demand is very strong. Is that enough to answer your question, Brett? Brett Simpson -- Arete Research -- Analyst That's great. Thank you. Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. Thank you, Brett. Operator, do we have anyone else on the line? It seems not. Operator We don't. Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK, we don't. Then let's go back to the floor. I think on the left side, Bruce Lu from Goldman Sachs. Bruce Lu -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Hi, thank you for taking my question. To be honest, I'm a bit surprised that the long-term gross margin target doesn't really change it. I believe TSMC's value is definitely more than selling the pass on the cost. I believe that TSMC needs to invest a lot more in R&D to maintain the leadership. TSMC suggested a raise the gross margin target in 2022 with higher R&D requirement, with higher profitability target, right? So, I asked the same question two quarters ago, which is in the process of pricing negotiation, which is understandable. But I think the price negotiation is pretty much done. What's the discrepancy here? Why TSMC cannot raise the profitability target? Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. So, Bruce's first question, he wants to know, again, our long-term gross margin. Why are we not changing the target of 53% and higher, OK? He correctly notes that certainly, TSMC's value is increasing. And certainly, TSMC would need to invest a lot of money in R&D and capacity to support our customers' growth. So, we have always had a focus on earning the right return. He also notes in 2022, while our gross margin used to be about 50%, then we raised it to 53% and higher. So, the question is, why is it not any higher, I guess? Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Bruce, as we said, six factors affecting the profitability. Every year, different factors have different weight. Now two things to note. Number one, starting from this year, overseas fab expansion, 2 to 3 percentage point impact every year for the next five years. The other thing to note: Macro environment uncertainty, which may lead to impacting the global economy, which may lead to end market demand. Now having said that, we are in a capital-intensive industry. So, we will need to have to earn a healthy return to continue to invest to support our customers, support their growth, and also deliver a profitable growth to our shareholders. And you mentioned about the raising of long-term gross margins back in 2022 to 53% and higher. And we have been able to deliver that in higher parts since then. So, given all the above, we continue to think that 53% and higher gross margin is achievable, and we work very hard to achieve on the higher part. Bruce Lu -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst OK. I'll try next two quarters. For the CoWoS capacity, TSMC has been very aggressive in expanding the capacity. However, the application is highly concentrated in AI at the current stage, which there are certain noise around it. When can we see non-AI application such as servers, smartphones or anything else can be -- can start to adopt CoWoS capacity in case there is any fluctuation in the AI demand? Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. Thank you, Bruce. So, Bruce's second question is on CoWoS capacity. In his words, we have been very aggressive to expand the capacity, but his concern is highly concentrated with AI-related demand. So, his question is, when do we expect or -- to see more non-AI application adoption of CoWoS solutions? C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer Well, yeah, today is all AI-focused, and we have very tight capacity and cannot even meet customers' need. But with the other products we adopt this kind of CoWoS approach, they will, it's coming, and we know that it's coming. So, that's all I can say. Bruce Lu -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst When? C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer It's coming. Bruce Lu -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst OK. I will try next quarter. C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer On the CPU and on the server chip, let me give you a hint. Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. Thank you, Bruce. We'll go to the middle, Arthur Lai from Macquarie. Arthur Lai -- Macquarie Group -- Analyst Hi, Wendell and Jeff. I'm Arthur Lai from Macquarie. So, first of all, congrats on the strong gross margin. I just have a very quick follow-up on the U.S. and JP expansion as this is important. My client keeps chasing me. So, do you have operational strategy to mitigate the cost gap between the overseas fab and Taiwan fab? Yeah, I think, C. C., you hint that you will work on it and then improve the gross margin. But during the Chinese New Year, I read Morris Chang, his autobiography, and he mentioned that the strategy is copied exactly from the Taiwan model. So, I want to understand how we maintain the high yield and also drive the cost down. Thank you. Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. So, Arthur's question is about our overseas expansion. His question is related to the cost gap and what is our operational strategies to mitigate the cost gap. How are we doing this internally in our fab operations and what strategies to do so? C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer Mention my boss' book, that's -- meaning that you really read it. What he said is a copy exactly is whatever Taiwan's improvement, the U.S. will copy over there. It doesn't mean that this year, next year and the following year will be the same. We continue to improve. That improved the cost structure, both in Taiwan and in the U.S. And we also try very hard to find out new methodology or whatever that I cannot share with you right now. But it will give Arizona fab some benefit. And so, we will improve -- what minimize the gap between the cost structure between U.S. and Taiwan. And we are working on that. But no matter what I said, who would be the best fab over there. Arthur Lai -- Macquarie Group -- Analyst Second follow-up question probably is on Wendell. You just mentioned that there's 200 bps or 300 bps margin dilution, right? So, can you give us one level down? Sounds like the variable cost and the fixed cost. Maybe half? Or maybe which one is higher? Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. So, Arthur's second question is on the overseas dilution of 2% to 3%. He is asking if we can provide a further breakdown in terms of how much of that is composed of variable costs, how much of that is from the fixed cost, etc. Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Arthur, we really don't give a breakdown on these numbers, but both of them are higher. That's all I can share with you. Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. Thank you. We'll move to the right side of the room. I think Rick Hsu from Daiwa Securities. Rick Hsu -- Analyst So, the first one, C. C., can you share with us your view on this year's global semiconductor revenue forecast as memory? Or any driver-by applications in priority across the main application? Thank you. Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. So, Rick's first question, he's asking for our forecast of the semiconductor industry, what we used to provide as semi-XMIM. But of course, we have already given Foundry 2.0. Then he would like the outlook by end market application in terms of ranking. Maybe just a comment on the overall end markets as a whole. C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer Rick, I think the memory business will grow this year also. But all I can say is that we are growing very fast. And I don't comment on other memories because it's not logic yet. And we have already provided Foundry 2.0 to grow 10% year over year. That's our industry forecast for 2025. Rick Hsu -- Analyst Just a quick follow-up. Can I use your Foundry 2.0 market growth as a proxy of the global semi ex memory? Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations So, his question is, can we use Foundry 2.0 as a proxy for semiconductor ex memory? C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. Rick Hsu -- Analyst And the second one is very quick. About your CoWoS and SOI capacity ramp, can you give us more color this year? Because recently, there seems to be a lot of market noise some add orders, some cut orders. So, I would like to see your view on the CoWoS ramp. Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. So, the second question is lots of market rumors here. So, he would like to know any comment we can provide on CoWoS ramp in 2025. C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer Rick, as you said, there's a lot of rumor. That's a rumor. I assure you. We are working very hard to meet the requirement of my customers' demand. So, cut the order, that won't happen. I actually continue to increase. So, we are -- again, I will say that we are working very hard to increase the capacity. Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. Thank you. Rick Hsu -- Analyst Thank you. Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. Let's move back to the operator. Is there anyone online? Operator Yes. We have next one, Robert Sanders, Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, please. Robert Sanders -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Yeah. Hi, there. I just had a question on AI demand. Is there a scenario where HBM is more of a constraint on the demand rather than CoWoS, which seems to be the biggest constraint at the moment? And I have a follow-up. Thanks. Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. So, Rob is asking us to comment on AI demand in HBM status constraint. Or what is the bigger constraint in AI demand? C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer I don't have other suppliers, but I know that we have a very tight capacity to support the AI demand. I don't want to say I'm the bottleneck. TSMC always working very hard with customers to meet their requirements. That's all I can say. Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations You have a second question? Robert Sanders -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Yeah. Just on SoIC, there's been more discussion in the market around your smartphone customers adopting SoIC. Can you just discuss if there's any kind of inflection point here, whether it's in the PC domain or the smartphone domain? Or is this still more of a data center story? Thanks. Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. Well, Rob's second question is on SoIC adoption. His question basically in a nutshell is when do we see an inflection point for smartphone applications to adopt SoIC? C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer Today, SoIC's defense is still focused on AI applications, OK. For PC or for other areas, it's coming, but not right now. Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. Thank you, Rob. Thank you, CC. I think in the interest of the time, we'll take the last two questions, please. OK. I guess we will go to Sunny Lin from UBS. Sunny Lin -- UBS -- Analyst Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. And so, my first question is to try to get a bit more clarity on the cloud growth for 2025. I think longer term, without a doubt, the technology definitely has lots of potential for demand opportunities. But I think if we look at 2025 and 2026, I think there could be increasing uncertainties coming from maybe CSP spending macro or even some of the supply chain challenges. And so, I understand the management just provided pretty good guidance for this year for sales to double. And so, if you look at that number, do you think there is still more upside than downside as we go through 2025? Or how should we think about the demand profile for this year and next year? Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. Well, Sunny's question is about the AI-related demand. We have said that even after tripling -- more than tripling last year, it will double again in 2025. She wants to know if there is an upside or downside to this. And also for us to provide an outlook on the 2026 AI growth. C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer Sunny, I certainly hope there is an upside, but I hope I get -- my team can supply enough capacity to support it. Does that give you enough hints? OK? And we also forecast based on the 2024 high number. We also forecast of mid-40s is bigger for the next five years. That gives you some kind of estimate that you can calculate. Sunny Lin -- UBS -- Analyst Yeah. Also, mid-40 % is the long-term expectation in terms of growth by the next few years. But how should we think about the trajectory of the growth? For sure, this year, it's still pretty strong growth, but do you think at some point maybe we see a moderation of growth temporarily and then followed by another ramp? Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations Well, I think Sunny's question, again, is asking us to comment on the 2026 outlook, which is a little bit early. Or is that -- how do we see the trajectory of the growth? C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer I already said it's a little bit too early. Sunny Lin -- UBS -- Analyst Sure. No problem. So, I will follow up maybe next quarter as well. And so, my second question is on edge AI. And so, last year, management thought mid-2025 to be the inflection point for it to see more content-related edge AI. So, based on your current visibility, are you seeing clients ramping for this year for the edge AI products maybe into the second half? And before, you also mentioned edge AI could potentially drive a 5% to 10% die size increase. Will that be a one-time increase? Or do you think beyond the 5% to 10% increase for the maybe first-gen product, there should be a sustainable increase going forward? Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. So, Sunny, second question is related to edge AI. She'd like some more detail or color. Do we see customers ramping edge or what we call on-device AI products in the second half of this year? And the second part, in terms of the content increase, 5% to 10% increase is a one-time thing? Is this an ongoing thing? How do we estimate the content benefit from on-device AI? C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer OK. On the edge AI, in our observation, we found out that our customers started to put more neural processing inside. And so, we estimate a 5% to 10% more silicon being used. Keep every year 5% to 10%, definitely is no, right? So, they will move to the next node, the technology migration. That's also to TSMC's advantage. Not only that, I also say that the replacement cycle, I think it will be shortened because of when you have a new toy that with AI functionality inside, everybody wants to replace their smartphone, replace their PCs, and I count that one much more than a mere 5% increase. Did I answer your question? Sunny Lin -- UBS -- Analyst Yeah, thank you very much. Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. Thank you. Operator, I think there's one more participant online. So, we'll take the last question from online participants, please. Operator I think the last caller just dropped the line. Thank you. Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. Then we'll take the last question from Brad Lin from Bank of America. Brad Lin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Thank you for squeezing me in. So, Happy New Year, and taking my questions. I would like to ask two questions. First question would be on the CoWoS as well. So, we have observed an increasing margin of advanced packaging. Could you remind us the CoWoS contribution of last year? And do you expect the margin to kind of approach the corporate average even exceed after the so-called value reflection this year? That would be my first question. Thank you. Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. So, Brad's first question is very specific to CoWoS. Basically, he wants to know what is the revenue contribution from CoWoS last year. And what is the margin profile? Maybe we can talk about advanced packaging. Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Brad, we don't break it down into different segments of the advanced packaging. But overall speaking, advanced packaging accounted for over 8% of revenue last year, and it will account for over 10% this year. In terms of gross margins, it is better. It is better than before, but still below the corporate average. Thank you. Brad Lin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Thank you, Wendell. That's very helpful. And then my second question will be on the IDM. So, we have seen IDMs increasingly rely on TSMC. And then do we still expect the IDM to support our long-term growth? Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. So, Brad's second question, I think, is on IDM and IDM outsourcing. He does know that we do see more IDM outsourcing business. So, is this part of our long-term growth outlook CAGR? C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer Again, let me repeat again. They are our very good customers. And we work together. I don't say they rely on TSMC. We are partners. And I really hope that a long-term relationship will be there for sure. Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations OK. Thank you, C.C. Thank you, Brad. Thank you, everyone. This concludes our Q&A session. Before we conclude today's conference, please be advised that the replay of the conference will be accessible within 30 minutes from now. The transcript will become available 24 hours from now, and certainly, both will be available through TSMC's website at www.tsmc.com. So, thank you, everyone, for joining us today online and in person. We'd like to wish everyone a Happy New Year and hope everyone continues to stay well, and I hope you'll join us again next quarter.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Hidden Gem Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

& Body Works Investing.com Fri, Jan 10, 2025, 7:32 PM 1 min read In This Article: ROST -0.31% CPRI +0.25% Investing.com -- Wells Fargo forecast a stable consumer backdrop in 2025, supported by healthy U.S. demand, a strong holiday season, and stabilizing European trends, according to its retail sector outlook. The brokerage upgraded Bath&Body Works (NYSE:BBWI) Inc and Capri Holdings (NYSE:CPRI) Ltd to \"overweight,\" given their growth potential and valuation upside. Ross Stores Inc (NASDAQ:ROST) was downgraded to \"equal weight\" due to a more balanced outlook. \u201cWe believe ROST's current upside potential is limited given a slowing comp trajectory as ROST still works to adjust their mix shift, and margins coming under pressure from their mix shift initiative, a lack of notable comp leverage, and persistent payroll pressure,\u201d analyst added. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) highlighted inventory concerns and freight challenges as risks to already elevated margins, with gross margins about 400 basis points above 2019 levels. Top long picks include Bath&Body Works Inc, Capri Holdings, RealReal (NASDAQ:REAL) Inc, Signet Jewelers (NYSE:SIG) Ltd, and Tapestry (NYSE:TPR) Inc. Short ideas target Hanesbrands (NYSE:HBI) Inc, Canada Goose Holdings Inc (NYSE:GOOS), Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) Inc, and VF Corp (NYSE:VFC), citing valuation and company-specific challenges.

(Photo: Business Wire) Survey Reveals Americans Hold Onto Undergarments for Longer Than They Should, Impacting Everyday Comfort WINSTON-SALEM, N.C., January 09, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--HanesBrands Inc. (NYSE: HBI), a global leader in iconic apparel brands, is encouraging Americans to reassess their underwear and bra drawers as part of its latest campaign: \"If You Wouldn\u2019t Flaunt It, Refresh It.\" A fresh wardrobe starts with comfortable undergarments, and according to a new survey of 2,000 U.S. adults commissioned by HanesBrands, many Americans are holding onto their underwear and bras far longer than recommended. In fact, the average person keeps their underwear for three years, with some hanging onto pairs for six years or more\u2014long past their prime for comfort and fit. When is it time to replace your underwear or bra? Respondents answered with some key signs including holes (71%), stains (42%), or stretched-out waistbands and straps (39%). On average, it takes just two holes for people to consider tossing their old undergarments, yet four in five respondents (82%) admitted they\u2019ve put on underwear only to realize it was past its prime. \"Undergarments are some of the most frequently worn and washed items in your wardrobe, so it\u2019s important to replenish those pieces,\" said Dawn Hedgepeth, CMO at HanesBrands. \"Replacing old, stretched-out underwear and bras with fresh, supportive pieces can make a noticeable difference in your day. With our wide range of styles and sizes, HanesBrands is here to help you find the perfect fit, so you can feel confident and comfortable all day long.\" Undergarments for Special Occasions? While most Americans do not have specific undergarments set aside for special occasions, the survey showed that women in the Southeast were the exception. Fifty-two percent of these respondents said they have a special bra reserved for intimate moments or special events. Maidenform and Bali both have an assortment of sexy bras designed to keep you confidently comfortable for special occasions: One Fab Fit Everyday Full Coverage Racerback Bra Bali Breathe Wireless T-Shirt Bra One Smooth U Comfort Stretch Lace Underwire Bra Comfort Devotion Convertible Underwire Bra Favorite Type of Underwear: Bright, Colorful Briefs When asked about their favorite type of underwear, colorful briefs took the top spot, with many Americans opting for plain but vibrant pieces. This preference aligns with a broader trend of undergarments being both functional and fun, allowing wearers to express their style while staying comfortable. Story Continues Hanes and Maidenform offer colorful options to update your wardrobe: Hanes Originals Women\u2019s Seamless Rib Hi-Rise Cheeky Underwear Hanes Originals Women\u2019s Bikini Underwear Hanes Moves Men\u2019s Boxer Briefs with Total Support Pouch Maidenform M Seamless High Leg Bikini Maidenform One Fab Fit Microfiber Boyshort Underwear With Lace Time to Refresh Your Undergarments The study also looked at what constitutes a fully-stocked underwear drawer and found that the average person only has four \"good\" pairs of underwear and women reported having just three \"good\" bras in their wardrobe. However, people often keep their bras for four years, with some even holding onto bras for a decade. This means that many of these garments have been worn thousands of times before people replace them! Bali, Hanes and Maidenform have a variety of comfortable styles to update your wardrobe, including the latest new innovations in underwear and fabrications: Hanes Originals Women's SuperSoft String Bikini Underwear, 3-Pack Hanes Originals Ultimate Men's SuperSoft Boxer Brief Underwear, Assorted, 3-Pack Hanes Moves Ultimate Men's Anti-Chafe Boxer Brief Underwear, Total Support Pouch, X-Temp, Black, 4-Pack Hanes Comfort, Period.

Scenarios where respondents said they\u2019d need an extra pair include potential accidents (39%) or times when they expect to change clothes during the day (37%). The survey also revealed a generational trend: 60% of Gen Z and 57% of millennials said they carry \"just-in-case\" underwear. \"When it comes to essentials like underwear and bras, a fresh pair can make all the difference in how you feel throughout the day,\" said Dawn Hedgepeth, CMO for HanesBrands . \"With our brands, including Hanes, Bali, Maidenform, and Playtex, we\u2019re all about making sure you\u2019re comfortable, supported, and confident in your undergarments.

announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Crocs, Inc. CROX, Under Armour, Inc. UAA, V.F. Corp. VFC, Ralph Lauren Corp. RL and Hanesbrands Inc. HBI. Here are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog: Forget Crocs, Bet On These 4 Top Consumer Discretionary Stocks The Consumer Discretionary sector, comprising companies that sell non-essential goods and services, demonstrated notable resilience in 2024. Despite challenges stemming from persistent inflation and elevated interest rates, U.S. consumers continued to spend, propelling the sector. However, not all stocks in the sector kept pace with the sector's performance. One such stock is Crocs, Inc. , which has a prominent position in the Textile - Apparel industry. Crocs, known for its innovative and versatile footwear offerings, has faced unique challenges in an increasingly competitive and dynamic market environment. Why CROX Struggled to Maintain its Rally? Crocs has been facing significant challenges that make it a less compelling investment opportunity in the near term. Despite strong third-quarter 2024 results, Crocs' HEYDUDE brand underperformed and weighed on overall revenues. HEYDUDE revenues declined 17.4% year over year due to a 22.9% drop in wholesale revenues, a 9.3% decrease in direct-to-consumer (DTC) revenues and a 22.2% decline in comparable DTC sales. While the decline in wholesale revenues aligned with the company's guidance, the unexpected drop in DTC revenues was attributed to a strategic shift from performance marketing to brand marketing. Although Crocs is making progress on initiatives to revitalize the HEYDUDE brand, the company acknowledged that its recent performance and the current operating environment suggest a longer-than-anticipated timeline for a turnaround. Looking ahead, Crocs anticipates a relatively subdued consumer environment in the United States. It noted that the industry saw heightened promotional activities in China during the mid-season festival, reflecting a more conservative approach by China consumers. As a result, the company expects to see a greater pullback in major Tier 1 cities like Shanghai and Beijing. Due to these factors, management provided a pessimistic outlook for the fourth quarter of 2024. The company anticipates the HEYDUDE brand's revenues to decline 4-6% in the fourth quarter, while revenues for the Crocs brand are expected to grow 2% year over year. Management anticipates enterprise revenues to remain flat or increase slightly year over year in constant currency. For the fourth quarter, international growth is projected to slow due to regulatory pressures in India, while North America faces challenges from selective consumer behavior and the timing of wholesale shipments. Story Continues For 2024, enterprise revenues are projected to increase 3% year over year in constant currency, which is at the lower end of the previously mentioned 3-5%. Revenues for the Crocs brand are expected to grow 8%, while HEYDUDE brand revenues are anticipated to decline 14.5% due to weaker-than-expected sellouts in both wholesale and digital channels. Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have declined 17.3% in the past three months against the Consumer Discretionary sector's gain of 8.7%. How Crox is Setting Up for Future Success Despite facing challenges, Crocs remains committed to its long-term growth strategy, focusing on enhancing brand awareness through iconic product lines, strategic investments in key markets and expanding its product range to attract more consumers. The company has seen success in boosting global brand desirability through high-profile collaborations, including with Bath & Body Works, Batman and McDonald's. Crocs is also focusing on its Echo and in-motion product franchises with affordable, fashion-forward items, as well as launching innovative products like Pet Crocs. For the HEYDUDE brand, Crocs is addressing challenges by refining its brand perception, reducing excess inventory and narrowing its retail focus to premium markets while also increasing average selling prices to improve margins. 4 Better Consumer Discretionary Picks For investors seeking growth and resilience, there are better options in the Consumer Discretionary space. Companies with established global brands, strategic expansions and innovative product lines are well-equipped to outperform. Let's explore four compelling stocks that offer stronger growth prospects and a more balanced approach than Crocs. Under Armour, Inc. emerges as a compelling investment choice with its strategic focus on several key areas to drive long-term success. By enhancing brand strength, the company is looking to strengthen its market identity and appeal to a broader, more engaged consumer base.

UAA has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 75.1%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Under Armour's current fiscal-year sales and EPS implies declines of 10.6% and 50%, respectively, from the prior-year actuals.

+1.52% HBI +1.08% VFC +0.71% The Consumer Discretionary sector, comprising companies that sell non-essential goods and services, demonstrated notable resilience in 2024. Despite challenges stemming from persistent inflation and elevated interest rates, U.S. consumers continued to spend, propelling the sector. However, not all stocks in the sector kept pace with the sector\u2019s performance. One such stock is Crocs, Inc. CROX, which has a prominent position in the Textile - Apparel industry. Crocs, known for its innovative and versatile footwear offerings, has faced unique challenges in an increasingly competitive and dynamic market environment. Why CROX Struggled to Maintain its Rally? Crocs has been facing significant challenges that make it a less compelling investment opportunity in the near term. Despite strong third-quarter 2024 results, Crocs' HEYDUDE brand underperformed and weighed on overall revenues. HEYDUDE revenues declined 17.4% year over year due to a 22.9% drop in wholesale revenues, a 9.3% decrease in direct-to-consumer (DTC) revenues and a 22.2% decline in comparable DTC sales. While the decline in wholesale revenues aligned with the company\u2019s guidance, the unexpected drop in DTC revenues was attributed to a strategic shift from performance marketing to brand marketing. Although Crocs is making progress on initiatives to revitalize the HEYDUDE brand, the company acknowledged that its recent performance and the current operating environment suggest a longer-than-anticipated timeline for a turnaround. Looking ahead, Crocs anticipates a relatively subdued consumer environment in the United States. It noted that the industry saw heightened promotional activities in China during the mid-season festival, reflecting a more conservative approach by China consumers. As a result, the company expects to see a greater pullback in major Tier 1 cities like Shanghai and Beijing. Due to these factors, management provided a pessimistic outlook for the fourth quarter of 2024. The company anticipates the HEYDUDE brand\u2019s revenues to decline 4-6% in the fourth quarter, while revenues for the Crocs brand are expected to grow 2% year over year. Management anticipates enterprise revenues to remain flat or increase slightly year over year in constant currency. For the fourth quarter, international growth is projected to slow due to regulatory pressures in India, while North America faces challenges from selective consumer behavior and the timing of wholesale shipments. For 2024, enterprise revenues are projected to increase 3% year over year in constant currency, which is at the lower end of the previously mentioned 3-5%. Revenues for the Crocs brand are expected to grow 8%, while HEYDUDE brand revenues are anticipated to decline 14.5% due to weaker-than-expected sellouts in both wholesale and digital channels. Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have declined 17.3% in the past three months against the Consumer Discretionary sector\u2019s gain of 8.7%. Story Continues How Crox is Setting Up for Future Success Despite facing challenges, Crocs remains committed to its long-term growth strategy, focusing on enhancing brand awareness through iconic product lines, strategic investments in key markets and expanding its product range to attract more consumers. The company has seen success in boosting global brand desirability through high-profile collaborations, including with Bath & Body Works, Batman and McDonald's. Crocs is also focusing on its Echo and in-motion product franchises with affordable, fashion-forward items, as well as launching innovative products like Pet Crocs. For the HEYDUDE brand, Crocs is addressing challenges by refining its brand perception, reducing excess inventory and narrowing its retail focus to premium markets while also increasing average selling prices to improve margins.
