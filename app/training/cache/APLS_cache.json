Receives Approval of SYFOVRE\u00ae (pegcetacoplan) in Australia for Geographic Atrophy (GA) Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Tue, Jan 28, 2025, 12:00 AM 4 min read In This Article: APLS Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. WALTHAM, Mass., Jan. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: APLS) announced\u00a0today that the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has approved SYFOVRE \u00ae (pegcetacoplan) for the every-other-month treatment of adult patients with geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with an intact fovea and when central vision is threatened by GA lesion growth. SYFOVRE is the first and only approved treatment for GA in Australia. \"The approval of SYFOVRE marks a significant milestone for GA patients across Australia. For the first time, Australians with GA will have a treatment to slow the progression of this irreversible form of vision loss,\u201d said Jeffrey Eisele, Ph.D., chief development officer, Apellis. \u201cBuilding on the success in the U.S., we are excited to bring SYFOVRE to even more patients who are impacted by this devastating disease.\u201d More than 75,000 Australians are living with GA, an advanced form of AMD and leading cause of blindness worldwide. 1 It is a progressive and irreversible disease caused by the growth of lesions, which destroy the retinal cells responsible for vision. The vision loss caused by GA severely impairs independence and quality of life. \u201cAs a retina specialist, I have seen how GA often takes away a person\u2019s ability to read, drive, and even see faces of their loved ones,\u201d said Professor Robyn Guymer, AM, deputy director, Centre for Eye Research Australia. \u201cThe approval of SYFOVRE is a historic moment full of hope for the Australian GA community, who have been waiting for a treatment.\u201d The approval is based on results from the Phase 3 OAKS and DERBY studies at 24 months. In the studies, treatment with both every-other-month and monthly SYFOVRE slowed GA progression and showed a generally well-tolerated safety profile. The results were published in The Lancet in October 2023. About SYFOVRE \u00ae (pegcetacoplan injection) SYFOVRE \u00ae (pegcetacoplan injection) is the first-ever approved therapy for geographic atrophy (GA). By targeting C3, SYFOVRE is designed to provide comprehensive control of the complement cascade, part of the body\u2019s immune system. SYFOVRE is approved in the United States and Australia. About Apellis Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a global biopharmaceutical company that combines courageous science and compassion to develop life-changing therapies for some of the most challenging diseases patients face. We ushered in the first new class of complement medicine in 15 years and now have two approved medicines targeting C3. These include the first-ever therapy for geographic atrophy, a leading cause of blindness around the world. We believe we have only begun to unlock the potential of targeting C3 across many serious diseases. For more information, please visit http://apellis.com or follow us on X and LinkedIn .

Business Wire Sat, Jan 25, 2025, 11:00 PM 16 min read In This Article: PFE Clinically meaningful and statistically significant results from the Phase 3 BREAKWATER trial show objective response rate of 61% with Pfizer\u2019s BRAFTOVI combination regimen compared to 40% with investigator\u2019s choice of chemotherapy, representing a doubling of the odds of achieving an objective response BRAFTOVI combination regimen is the first and only targeted therapy approved by the U.S. FDA for treatment-na\u00efve patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with a BRAF V600E mutation NEW YORK, January 25, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced positive results from the Phase 3 BREAKWATER trial evaluating BRAFTOVI \u00ae (encorafenib) in combination with cetuximab (marketed as ERBITUX \u00ae ) and mFOLFOX6 (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with a BRAF V600E mutation. At the time of this analysis, the BRAFTOVI combination regimen demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in confirmed objective response rate (ORR) assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) compared to patients receiving chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab (60.9% vs 40.0%, odds ratio =2.443, p=0.0008). These results will be presented today in an oral presentation (Abstract 16) at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancer Symposium (ASCO GI) and were simultaneously published in Nature Medicine . \"Despite the high unmet need in this patient population, prior to the recent encorafenib combination regimen approval, there were no approved biomarker-driven therapies indicated for people with previously untreated BRAF V600E -mutant metastatic colorectal cancer,\" said Scott Kopetz, M.D., Ph.D., FACP, Professor and Deputy Chair of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and co-principal investigator of the BREAKWATER trial. \"These data from the BREAKWATER study show the potential for this targeted treatment regimen to become the new standard of care for people with BRAF V600E -mutant metastatic colorectal cancer, for whom long-term disease control is critical.\" The estimated median duration of response as assessed by BICR was 13.9 months (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 8.5-not estimable [NE]) with BRAFTOVI plus cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 and 11.1 months (95% CI: 6.7-12.7) with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab. Of patients on BRAFTOVI plus cetuximab and mFOLFOX6, 22.4% (n=15) had a response lasting 12 months or longer, compared to 11.4% (n=5) with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab. The median time to response as assessed by BICR was 7.1 weeks (range 5.7-53.7) with BRAFTOVI plus cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 and 7.3 weeks (range 5.4-48.0) with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab. Leer m\u00e1s Overall survival (OS) data were immature at the time of this analysis but demonstrated a promising trend in favor of BRAFTOVI plus cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 compared to patients receiving chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab. Median OS with BRAFTOVI plus cetuximab with chemotherapy was not estimable (95% CI: 19.8-NE) and 14.6 months (95% CI: 13.4-NE) with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.318-0.691). The BREAKWATER trial is ongoing for OS and progression-free survival (PFS), with PFS results expected in 2025. \"These results of this first analysis were the basis for the first approval of a targeted therapy regimen for use in the first-line setting for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with a BRAF V600E mutation,\" said Roger Dansey, M.D., Chief Oncology Officer, Pfizer. \"We are highly encouraged by these response results, which are indicative of the clinically meaningful benefit of BRAFTOVI in reducing tumor size or having no detectable cancer, along with the promising interim analysis of overall survival. We look forward to additional read-outs from the BREAKWATER trial this year.\" The safety profile of BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 in the BREAKWATER trial was consistent with the known safety profile of each respective agent. No new safety signals were identified. Serious treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 37.7% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 compared to 34.6% of patients receiving chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab. BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 was granted accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with BRAF V600E -mutant mCRC in December 2024. The approval was among the first in the industry to be conducted under the FDA\u2019s Project FrontRunner, which seeks to support the development and approval of new cancer drugs for advanced or metastatic disease. The BREAKWATER data are also being discussed with other regulatory authorities around the world to support potential future additional license applications for the BRAFTOVI combination regimen in this indication. Pfizer is continuing its commitment to help non-scientists understand the latest findings with the development of abstract plain language summaries (APLS) for company-sponsored research being presented, which are written in non-technical language. Those interested in learning more can visit www.Pfizer.com/apls to access the summaries. About BREAKWATER BREAKWATER is a Phase 3, randomized, active-controlled, open-label, multicenter trial of BRAFTOVI with cetuximab, alone or in combination with mFOLFOX6 in participants with previously untreated BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC. Patients were randomized to receive BRAFTOVI 300 mg orally once daily in combination with cetuximab (discontinued after randomization of 158 patients), BRAFTOVI 300 mg orally once daily in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 (n=236) or mFOLFOX6, FOLFOXIRI, or CAPOX each with or without bevacizumab (control-arm) (n=243). The dual primary endpoints are ORR, which was met at the time of analysis, and PFS as assessed by BICR. OS is a key secondary endpoint. About Colorectal Cancer (CRC) CRC is the third most common type of cancer in the world, with approximately 1.8 million new diagnoses in 2022. 1 It is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. 2 Overall, the lifetime risk of developing CRC is about 1 in 24 for men and 1 in 26 for women. 2 In the U.S. alone, an estimated 154,270 people will be diagnosed with cancer of the colon or rectum in 2025, and approximately 53,000 are estimated to die from the disease each year. 3 For 20% of those diagnosed with CRC, the disease has metastasized, or spread, making it harder to treat, and up to 50% of patients with localized disease eventually develop metastases. 4 BRAF mutations are estimated to occur in 8-12% of people with mCRC and represent a poor prognosis for these patients. 5 The BRAF V600E mutation is the most common BRAF mutation and the risk of mortality in CRC patients with the BRAF V600E mutation is more than double that of patients with no known mutation present. 5,6 Despite the high unmet need in BRAF V600E -mutant mCRC, prior to December 20, 2024, there were no approved biomarker-driven therapies specifically indicated for people with previously untreated BRAF V600E -mutant mCRC. 7,8 About BRAFTOVI \u00ae (encorafenib) BRAFTOVI is an oral small molecule kinase inhibitor that targets BRAF V600E . Inappropriate activation of proteins in the MAPK signaling pathway (RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK) has been shown to occur in certain cancers, including CRC. Pfizer has exclusive rights to BRAFTOVI in the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Middle East, and Africa. Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. has exclusive rights to commercialize the product in Japan and South Korea, Medison has exclusive rights to commercialize the product in Israel and Pierre Fabre Laboratories has exclusive rights to commercialize the product in all other countries, including Europe and Asia (excluding Japan and South Korea). INDICATION AND USAGE BRAFTOVI \u00ae (encorafenib) is indicated, in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6, for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with a BRAF V600E mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s). BRAFTOVI is also indicated, in combination with cetuximab, for the treatment of adult patients with mCRC with a BRAF V600E mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test, after prior therapy. Limitations of Use : BRAFTOVI is not indicated for treatment of patients with wild-type BRAF CRC. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Refer to the prescribing information for cetuximab and individual product components of mFOLFOX6 for recommended dosing and additional safety information. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS New Primary Malignancies: New primary malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous, can occur. In BEACON CRC (previously treated BRAF V600E mutation-positive mCRC), cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC), including keratoacanthoma (KA), occurred in 1.4% of patients with CRC, and a new primary melanoma occurred in 1.4% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab. In BREAKWATER (previously untreated BRAF V600E mutation-positive mCRC) skin papilloma was reported in 2.6%, basal cell carcinoma in 1.3%, squamous cell carcinoma of skin in 0.9%, keratoacanthoma in 0.4% and malignant melanoma in situ in 0.4% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6. Perform dermatologic evaluations prior to initiating treatment, every 2 months during treatment, and for up to 6 months following discontinuation of treatment. Manage suspicious skin lesions with excision and dermatopathologic evaluation. Dose modification is not recommended for new primary cutaneous malignancies. Based on its mechanism of action, BRAFTOVI may promote malignancies associated with activation of RAS through mutation or other mechanisms. Monitor patients receiving BRAFTOVI for signs and symptoms of non-cutaneous malignancies. Discontinue BRAFTOVI for RAS mutation-positive non-cutaneous malignancies. Monitor patients for new malignancies prior to initiation of treatment, while on treatment, and after discontinuation of treatment. Tumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-Type Tumors: In vitro experiments have demonstrated paradoxical activation of MAP-kinase signaling and increased cell proliferation in BRAF wild-type cells exposed to BRAF inhibitors. Confirm evidence of BRAF V600E or V600K mutation using an FDA-approved test prior to initiating BRAFTOVI. Cardiomyopathy: Cardiomyopathy manifesting as left ventricular dysfunction associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic decreases in ejection fraction, has been reported in patients. Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by echocardiogram or multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan prior to initiating treatment, 1 month after initiating treatment, and then every 2 to 3 months during treatment. The safety has not been established in patients with a baseline ejection fraction that is either below 50% or below the institutional lower limit of normal (LLN). Patients with cardiovascular risk factors should be monitored closely. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction. Hepatotoxicity: Hepatotoxicity can occur. In BREAKWATER (previously untreated BRAF V600E mutation-positive mCRC), the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 increases in liver function laboratory tests in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 was 2.2% for alkaline phosphatase, 1.3% for ALT, and 0.9% for AST. Monitor liver laboratory tests before initiation of BRAFTOVI, monthly during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction. Hemorrhage: In BEACON CRC (previously treated BRAF V600E mutation-positive mCRC), hemorrhage occurred in 19% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab; Grade 3 or higher hemorrhage occurred in 1.9% of patients, including fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage in 0.5% of patients. The most frequent hemorrhagic events were epistaxis (6.9%), hematochezia (2.3%), and rectal hemorrhage (2.3%). In BREAKWATER (previously untreated BRAF V600E mutation-positive mCRC), hemorrhage occurred in 30% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6; Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage occurred in 3% of patients. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction. Uveitis: Uveitis, including iritis and iridocyclitis, has been reported in patients treated with BRAFTOVI. Assess for visual symptoms at each visit. Perform an ophthalmological evaluation at regular intervals and for new or worsening visual disturbances, and to follow new or persistent ophthalmologic findings. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction. QT Prolongation: BRAFTOVI is associated with dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation in some patients. In BREAKWATER (previously untreated BRAF V600E mutation-positive mCRC), an increase of QTcF >500 ms was measured in 3.6% (8/222) of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6. Monitor patients who already have or who are at significant risk of developing QTc prolongation, including patients with known long QT syndromes, clinically significant bradyarrhythmias, severe or uncontrolled heart failure and those taking other medicinal products associated with QT prolongation. Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia prior to and during BRAFTOVI administration. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue for QTc >500 ms. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: BRAFTOVI can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. BRAFTOVI can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective nonhormonal contraception during treatment with BRAFTOVI and for 2 weeks after the final dose. Risks Associated with Combination Treatment: BRAFTOVI is indicated for use as part of a regimen in combination with cetuximab, or in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6. Refer to the prescribing information for cetuximab and individual product components of mFOLFOX6 for additional risk information. Lactation: Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with BRAFTOVI and for 2 weeks after the final dose. Infertility: Advise males of reproductive potential that BRAFTOVI may impair fertility. ADVERSE REACTIONS BREAKWATER Trial (previously untreated BRAF V600E mutation-positive mCRC) Serious adverse reactions occurred in 38% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6. Serious adverse reactions in >3% of patients included intestinal obstruction (3.5%) and pyrexia (3.5%).

BEACON CRC Trial (previously treated BRAF V600E mutation-positive mCRC) Most common adverse reactions (\u226525%, all grades) in the BRAFTOVI with cetuximab arm compared to irinotecan with cetuximab or FOLFIRI with cetuximab (control) were: fatigue (51% vs 50%), nausea (34% vs 41%), diarrhea (33% vs 48%), dermatitis acneiform (32% vs 43%), abdominal pain (30% vs 32%), decreased appetite (27% vs 27%), arthralgia (27% vs 3%), and rash (26% vs 26%). Other clinically important adverse reactions occurring in <10% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab was pancreatitis. Most common laboratory abnormalities (all grades) (\u226520%) in the BRAFTOVI with cetuximab arm compared to irinotecan with cetuximab or FOLFIRI with cetuximab (control) were: anemia (34% vs 48%) and lymphopenia (24% vs 35%). DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors: Avoid coadministration of BRAFTOVI with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, including grapefruit juice. If coadministration is unavoidable, reduce the BRAFTOVI dose. Strong CYP3A4 inducers: Avoid coadministration of BRAFTOVI with strong CYP3A4 inducers. Sensitive CYP3A4 substrates: Avoid the coadministration of BRAFTOVI with CYP3A4 substrates (including hormonal contraceptives) for which a decrease in plasma concentration may lead to reduced efficacy of the substrate. If the coadministration cannot be avoided, see the CYP3A4 substrate product labeling for recommendations. Dose reductions of drugs that are substrates of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or BCRP may be required when used concomitantly with BRAFTOVI. Avoid coadministration of BRAFTOVI with drugs known to prolong QT/QTc interval. View the full Prescribing Information .

About SYFOVRE \u00ae (pegcetacoplan injection) SYFOVRE \u00ae (pegcetacoplan injection) is the first-ever approved therapy for geographic atrophy (GA). By targeting C3, SYFOVRE is designed to provide comprehensive control of the complement cascade, part of the body\u2019s immune system. SYFOVRE is approved in the United States for the treatment of GA secondary to age-related macular degeneration. About EMPAVELI \u00ae /Aspaveli \u00ae (pegcetacoplan) EMPAVELI \u00ae /Aspaveli \u00ae (pegcetacoplan) is a targeted C3 therapy designed to regulate excessive activation of the complement cascade, part of the body\u2019s immune system, which can lead to the onset and progression of many serious diseases. It is approved for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) in the United States, European Union, and other countries globally. The therapy is also under investigation for several other rare diseases across nephrology and hematology. U.S. Important Safety Information for SYFOVRE \u00ae (pegcetacoplan injection) CONTRAINDICATIONS SYFOVRE is contraindicated in patients with ocular or periocular infections, in patients with active intraocular inflammation, and in patients with hypersensitivity to pegcetacoplan or any of the excipients in SYFOVRE. Systemic hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, rash, urticaria) have occurred. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Endophthalmitis and Retinal Detachments Intravitreal injections, including those with SYFOVRE, may be associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments. Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering SYFOVRE to minimize the risk of endophthalmitis. Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately. Retinal Vasculitis and/or Retinal Vascular Occlusion Retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion, typically in the presence of intraocular inflammation, have been reported with the use of SYFOVRE. Cases may occur with the first dose of SYFOVRE and may result in severe vision loss. Discontinue treatment with SYFOVRE in patients who develop these events. Patients should be instructed to report any change in vision without delay. Neovascular AMD In clinical trials, use of SYFOVRE was associated with increased rates of neovascular (wet) AMD or choroidal neovascularization (12% when administered monthly, 7% when administered every other month and 3% in the control group) by Month 24. Patients receiving SYFOVRE should be monitored for signs of neovascular AMD. In case anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (anti-VEGF) is required, it should be given separately from SYFOVRE administration. Intraocular Inflammation In clinical trials, use of SYFOVRE was associated with episodes of intraocular inflammation including: vitritis, vitreal cells, iridocyclitis, uveitis, anterior chamber cells, iritis, and anterior chamber flare. After inflammation resolves, patients may resume treatment with SYFOVRE. Increased Intraocular Pressure Acute increase in IOP may occur within minutes of any intravitreal injection, including with SYFOVRE. Perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored following the injection and managed as needed. ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22655%) are ocular discomfort, neovascular age-related macular degeneration, vitreous floaters, conjunctival hemorrhage. Please see accompanying full Prescribing Information for more information U.S. Important Safety Information for EMPAVELI \u00ae (pegcetacoplan) BOXED WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS CAUSED BY ENCAPSULATED BACTERIA EMPAVELI, a complement inhibitor, increases the risk of serious infections, especially those caused by encapsulated bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae type B. Life-threatening and fatal infections with encapsulated bacteria have occurred in patients treated with complement inhibitors. These infections may become rapidly life-threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early. Complete or update vaccination for encapsulated bacteria at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of EMPAVELI, unless the risks of delaying therapy with EMPAVELI outweigh the risks of developing a serious infection. Comply with the most current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations for vaccinations against encapsulated bacteria in patients receiving a complement inhibitor. Patients receiving EMPAVELI are at increased risk for invasive disease caused by encapsulated bacteria, even if they develop antibodies following vaccination. Monitor patients for early signs and symptoms of serious infections and evaluate immediately if infection is suspected. Because of the risk of serious infections caused by encapsulated bacteria, EMPAVELI is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the EMPAVELI REMS. CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitivity to pegcetacoplan or to any of the excipients For initiation in patients with unresolved serious infection caused by encapsulated bacteria including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae type B WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious Infections Caused by Encapsulated Bacteria EMPAVELI, a complement inhibitor, increases a patient\u2019s susceptibility to serious, life-threatening, or fatal infections caused by encapsulated bacteria including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis (caused by any serogroup, including non-groupable strains), and Haemophilus influenzae type B. Life-threatening and fatal infections with encapsulated bacteria have occurred in both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients treated with complement inhibitors. The initiation of EMPAVELI treatment is contraindicated in patients with unresolved serious infection caused by encapsulated bacteria. Complete or update vaccination against encapsulated bacteria at least 2 weeks prior to administration of the first dose of EMPAVELI, according to the most current ACIP recommendations for patients receiving a complement inhibitor. Revaccinate patients in accordance with ACIP recommendations considering the duration of therapy with EMPAVELI. Note that, ACIP recommends an administration schedule in patients receiving complement inhibitors that differs from the administration schedule in the vaccine prescribing information. If urgent EMPAVELI therapy is indicated in a patient who is not up to date with vaccines against encapsulated bacteria according to ACIP recommendations, provide the patient with antibacterial drug prophylaxis and administer these vaccines as soon as possible. The benefits and risks of treatment with EMPAVELI, as well as the benefits and risks of antibacterial drug prophylaxis in unvaccinated or vaccinated patients, must be considered against the known risks for serious infections caused by encapsulated bacteria. Vaccination does not eliminate the risk of serious encapsulated bacterial infections, despite development of antibodies following vaccination. Closely monitor patients for early signs and symptoms of serious infection and evaluate patients immediately if an infection is suspected. Inform patients of these signs and symptoms and instruct patients to seek immediate medical care if these signs and symptoms occur. Promptly treat known infections. Serious infection may become rapidly life-threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early. Consider interruption of EMPAVELI in patients who are undergoing treatment for serious infections. EMPAVELI is available only through a restricted program under a REMS. EMPAVELI REMS EMPAVELI is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called EMPAVELI REMS, because of the risk of serious infections caused by encapsulated bacteria. Notable requirements of the EMPAVELI REMS include the following: Under the EMPAVELI REMS, prescribers must enroll in the program. Prescribers must counsel patients about the risks, signs, and symptoms of serious infections caused by encapsulated bacteria, provide patients with the REMS educational materials, ensure patients are vaccinated against encapsulated bacteria at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of EMPAVELI, prescribe antibacterial drug prophylaxis if patients\u2019 vaccine status is not up to date and treatment must be started urgently, and provide instructions to always carry the Patient Safety Card both during treatment, as well as for 2 months following last dose of EMPAVELI. Pharmacies that dispense EMPAVELI must be certified in the EMPAVELI REMS and must verify prescribers are certified. Further information is available at www.empavelirems.com or 1-888-343-7073. Infusion-Related Reactions Systemic hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., facial swelling, rash, urticaria) have occurred in patients treated with EMPAVELI. One patient (less than 1% in clinical studies) experienced a serious allergic reaction which resolved after treatment with antihistamines. If a severe hypersensitivity reaction (including anaphylaxis) occurs, discontinue EMPAVELI infusion immediately, institute appropriate treatment, per standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms are resolved. Monitoring PNH Manifestations after Discontinuation of EMPAVELI After discontinuing treatment with EMPAVELI, closely monitor for signs and symptoms of hemolysis, identified by elevated LDH levels along with sudden decrease in PNH clone size or hemoglobin, or reappearance of symptoms such as fatigue, hemoglobinuria, abdominal pain, dyspnea, major adverse vascular events (including thrombosis), dysphagia, or erectile dysfunction. Monitor any patient who discontinues EMPAVELI for at least 8 weeks to detect hemolysis and other reactions. If hemolysis, including elevated LDH, occurs after discontinuation of EMPAVELI, consider restarting treatment with EMPAVELI. Interference with Laboratory Tests There may be interference between silica reagents in coagulation panels and EMPAVELI that results in artificially prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT); therefore, avoid the use of silica reagents in coagulation panels. ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions in patients with PNH (incidence \u226510%) were injection site reactions, infections, diarrhea, abdominal pain, respiratory tract infection, pain in extremity, hypokalemia, fatigue, viral infection, cough, arthralgia, dizziness, headache, and rash. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Females of Reproductive Potential EMPAVELI may cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to treatment with EMPAVELI. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with EMPAVELI and for 40 days after the last dose.
