[{"text": "HealthStream Launches HealthStream Learning Experience\u2122 (HLX) Application, Powering Extended Workforce Development Capabilities With an AI-First Approach Business Wire Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 5:25 PM 4 min read In This Article: HSTM -0.43% NASHVILLE, January 27, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--HealthStream (Nasdaq: HSTM), a leading healthcare technology platform for workforce solutions, today announces the launch of the HealthStream Learning Experience\u2122 (HLX), its groundbreaking learning experience application. The HLX is designed as a modern, healthcare-specific application to offer the healthcare workforce personalized, self-directed, intelligent learning and development pathways, incorporating a wide range of learning modalities\u2014all in an engaging and thoroughly modern user experience. With its innovative technologies, the HLX will make use of a wide variety of data to make smart recommendations of content and development pathways for each healthcare professional. The new application is integrated with HealthStream\u2019s Learning Center \u00ae and will integrate with HealthStream\u2019s Competency Suite\u2122 to assess each individual\u2019s unique skills and competencies and aid in identifying their career growth objectives and gaps. Kevin O\u2019Hara, Senior Vice President, Platform Solutions & Product Strategy, HealthStream, said, \"We are excited to already have three large healthcare organizations that have chosen to make the HLX a centerpiece of their employee development experience: two as designated launch partners and each demonstrating a forward-thinking approach to developing their respective workforces. They understand that in order to achieve maximum engagement, it is beneficial to now provide employees with tools that are more like what they use in their personal lives. I believe the HLX is exactly the application that will take their employees\u2019 learning experiences to the next level.\" For the thousands of hospitals and health systems currently using HealthStream\u2019s Learning Center application, adding the HLX offers an ideal application to build even further on that success to achieve important strategic initiatives\u2014like enhancing employee engagement, retention, growth and upskilling of its workforce, which are all supported in a myriad of ways with the HLX. For example, healthcare organizations may achieve faster workforce transitions by using the HLX as a key component of cross-training medical-surgical nurses to critical care nurses or any other such cross-training needs of its clinical workforce. In developing the HealthStream Learning Experience (HLX), HealthStream utilized an AI-first approach, envisioning how each feature and function of the application could be improved and enabled by the latest AI technologies and tools. These AI tools are supported by large language models (LLMs) to both assist managers in creating highly engaging learning experiences and to connect learners with the most relevant experiences in the form of content collections and pathways. These recommendation models also incorporate each user\u2019s personal portfolio of accomplishments, experiences, and interactions, aggregated and powered by the core of the HealthStream ecosystem, the Company\u2019s hStream platform. Story Continues Inherent in the design of the HealthStream Learning Experience (HLX) is an expansion of the types of learning and development experiences available. For example, online blogs, articles, videos, social learning, virtual reality, podcasts, and other online sources may also be included alongside online courses and assignments, while still providing the review and curation tools necessary in the highly regulated healthcare environment. Today\u2019s learners expect to be able to learn anywhere, learn just what they need, just the way they want it. The HLX is a powerful application that makes this possible for the healthcare workforce. \"Today\u2019s healthcare workforce deserves a learning experience as dynamic as they are\u2014and that is why we built the HealthStream Learning Experience,\" said Robert A. Frist, Jr., Chief Executive Officer, HealthStream. \"I believe the HLX represents a paradigm shift in how healthcare professionals can now acquire and share knowledge in engaging, immersive, and integrated ways. I\u2019m pleased to see three progressive healthcare organizations using the HLX\u2014and I look forward to engaging with additional healthcare organizations as we bring this innovative solution to the broader market.\" To learn more about the HealthStream Learning Experience (HLX) application, go HERE to read a recent interview of SVP Kevin O\u2019Hara in \"The Future of Healthcare Learning: Innovation and Interoperability.\" About HealthStream HealthStream (Nasdaq: HSTM) is the healthcare industry\u2019s largest ecosystem of platform-delivered workforce solutions that empowers healthcare professionals to do what they do best: deliver excellence in patient care.

Despite their rarity, there are over 7,000 identified rare diseases, and 80% of them are genetic in origin, often manifesting early in life. New York, USA, Dec. 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Comprehensive Market Analysis of Latest Published 9 Rare Genetic Disorders Reports | DelveInsight Rare genetic disorders affect approximately 1 in 10 people worldwide, meaning over 350 million individuals are living with these conditions. Despite their rarity, there are over 7,000 identified rare diseases, and 80% of them are genetic in origin, often manifesting early in life. Rare genetic disorders, often caused by mutations in a single gene or a combination of genetic factors, affect a small percentage of the population but collectively impact millions worldwide. Despite advances in genetic research and precision medicine, there remains a significant treatment gap. Many rare diseases are under-researched due to their low prevalence, which limits pharmaceutical investment and drug development. As a result, patients face limited treatment options, delayed diagnoses, and inadequate access to specialized care. Bridging this gap requires increased funding, collaborative global research, and innovative approaches like gene therapies, RNA-based treatments, and patient-centered clinical trials to provide hope and equitable healthcare solutions for affected individuals. DelveInsight has expertise in the rare disease market with an experienced team handling the rare disease domain proficiently. DelveInsight has recently released a series of epidemiology-based market reports on rare genetic disorders including Usher Syndrome, Alport Syndrome, Menkes Disease, Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency Type-A, Prader-Willi Syndrome, Osteogenesis Imperfecta, Myotonic Dystrophy, Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, and Neurofibromatosis type 1-associated Plexiform Neurofibromas . These reports include a comprehensive understanding of current treatment practices, emerging drugs, market share of individual therapies, and current and forecasted market size from 2020 to 2034\u00a0 segmented into 7MM [the United States, the EU4 (Germany, France, Italy, and Spain), the United Kingdom, and Japan]. Additionally, the reports feature an examination of prominent companies working with their lead candidates in different stages of clinical development. Let\u2019s deep dive into the assessment of these rare genetic disorders markets individually. Story Continues Usher Syndrome Market Usher syndrome is the most common cause of deaf-blindness, accounting for half of the cases in individuals under 65. This genetic disorder presents as a combination of hearing impairment, retinopathy, and vestibular dysfunction, with each symptom varying in form and onset. Among the 7MM, the US accounted for the highest prevalent cases of Usher syndrome in 2023, with around 21K cases; these cases are expected to increase during the forecast period. At present, LUXTURNA (voretigene neparvovec) is the only approved treatment for Usher Syndrome, specifically for a small subset of patients with the RPE65 mutation. However, no standard therapy exists for patients without this mutation, leaving most to depend on supportive care such as vitamin supplements, sun protection, and visual aids. According to DelveInsight\u2019s analysis, the market for Usher syndrome in the 7MM will grow from USD 76.48 million in 2023 at a CAGR of 10.55% by 2034.

It is an X-linked recessive condition caused by mutations in the ATP7A gene, which regulates copper transport in the body. The quality of life (QoL) of individuals with Menkes disease declines quickly due to the progressive worsening of symptoms and outcomes. As per our assessment, in 2023, nearly 177 diagnosed prevalent cases of Menkes disease were estimated in the 7MM. These cases are anticipated to increase by 2034. The US accounted for the highest cases. The progression of Menkes disease is unpredictable and rapid, often requiring medical intervention. Unfortunately, the prognosis for affected patients is poor, with survival typically not exceeding 3.5 years unless copper histidine or other copper replacement therapies are available. Currently, management of Menkes disease relies on standard care, including off-label copper supplements (such as copper histidine or copper chloride), antiepileptic drugs, L-threo-dihydroxyphenylserine , and other treatments. Advancements in therapeutic approaches have paved the way for emerging therapies. New treatments, such as CUTX-101, are currently under development for Menkes disease. At present, CUTX-101 appears to be the most promising candidate in the Menkes disease clinical pipeline. The market is expected to respond positively to CUTX-101, reinforcing its potential as a leading therapy for the condition, as no other therapy has yet achieved approval. We anticipate that the expected approval of emerging therapies and greater awareness of early disease screening will drive significant market growth in the 7MM from USD 7.9 million in 2023.

It results from the loss of function of sulfite oxidase, one of the four molybdenum-dependent enzymes in humans. DelveInsight\u2019s analysts estimate that approximately 270 prevalent cases of MOCOD-A were found in 2023 in the 7MM. The United States exhibited the highest diagnosed prevalent cases of MOCOD-A, as compared to other 7MM countries. The treatment of MoCoD-A is difficult because of its rarity and the need for specialized care. The main treatment goal is symptom management and preventing complications. MoCoD-A with severe neonatal symptoms has limited therapeutic options, and the prognosis is typically poor. Many infants require intubation for ventilation support due to seizures or impaired mental status. Generally, the approach involves informing parents and caregivers of the very poor prognosis and offering the option to refrain from aggressive resuscitation efforts or withdraw life-support measures. Attributed to the rising diagnosed prevalent cases and increasing awareness, the MoCoD-A market was valued at nearly USD 12 million in 2023 and is expected to experience consistent growth during the forecast period (2024\u20132034). Discover which therapies are expected to grab the MoCoD-A market share @ MoCoD-A Market Report Prader-Willi Syndrome Market Prader-Willi syndrome is a rare genetic condition that impacts individuals of both sexes from birth and throughout their lives. It is marked by reduced muscle tone, delays in motor development, mild to moderate cognitive impairments, incomplete sexual maturation, and emotional and social immaturity, often resulting in challenging behaviors. According to DelveInsight\u2019s analysis, there were 24,990 diagnosed prevalent cases of Prader-Willi syndrome in the 7MM in 2023. While several studies suggest a higher average diagnosis rate, ranging from 65-80% , real-world evidence from registries indicates a somewhat larger diagnosis gap. Despite the current disparity, the number of diagnosed cases is expected to increase during the forecast period (2024\u22122034) due to advancements in diagnostic technology, greater awareness of the condition, and the establishment of more PWS registries. Treatment options for Prader-Willi syndrome are currently limited and primarily focus on lifestyle modifications to reduce the risk of obesity-related deaths. Nearly half of the deaths in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome under 18 are linked to food-seeking behaviors, such as choking and accidents. The FDA has approved three growth hormone treatments for the condition: GENOTROPIN by Pfizer, NORDITROPIN by Novo Nordisk, and OMNITROPE by Sandoz. This approval enables healthcare providers to prescribe these therapies as alternatives. According to DelveInsight\u2019s analysis, the market size of Prader\u2013Willi syndrome in the 7MM reached USD 600 million in 2023 and is expected to increase by 2034 at a CAGR of ~6% , majorly due to the expected drastic YoY growth in diagnosis rate, and the high cost of the expected launch of several key therapies.

Individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta have fragile bones that fracture easily, even with minimal or no trauma. There are at least 19 identified types of osteogenesis imperfecta, ranging from type I to type XIX. While each type is characterized by specific signs and symptoms, many of their features overlap. In 2023, there were about 72K prevalent cases of osteogenesis imperfecta across the 7MM. In 2023, the US accounted for ~55% of all prevalent cases of osteogenesis imperfecta. Osteogenesis imperfecta treatment aims to prevent fractures and alleviate symptoms, as there is no cure for the condition. Bisphosphonates are often prescribed to improve bone strength and reduce the risk of fractures. Additional treatments may include physical therapy, orthopedic surgery, and assistive devices to improve mobility and independence. In more severe cases, surgeries such as rodding may be used to stabilize long bones and prevent deformities. In 2023, the osteogenesis imperfecta market across the 7MM was approximately USD 30 million . The market is anticipated to witness a substantial positive shift owing to better uptake of existing drugs, the expected market launch of therapies, and raised awareness.

Each form of muscular dystrophy presents unique abnormalities, including differences in muscle fiber size, muscle fiber death, the formation of scar tissue, and inflammation, all of which can be seen in muscle biopsies from affected individuals. As per DelveInsight\u2019s estimations, the total diagnosed prevalent cases of myotonic dystrophy in the 7MM was approximately 105K cases in 2023 and are projected to decrease during the forecast period. Currently, there is no approved therapy to cure or slow the progression of myotonic dystrophy, though symptomatic treatments are available. These treatments aim to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life (QoL). Among the symptoms of myotonic dystrophy, myotonia is the most common, and it is typically treated with antimyotonic agents such as mexiletine, lamotrigine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, flecainide, propafenone, phenytoin, and ranolazine , all of which are prescribed off-label. For chronic muscle pain, the pharmacological approach follows the WHO\u2019s four-step ladder, starting with NSAIDs, and, if necessary, adding adjuvant therapies like anticonvulsants (pregabalin, gabapentin), antidepressants (duloxetine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline), muscle relaxants (baclofen, tizanidine), or topical agents (lidocaine or capsaicin patches). The market for therapeutics targeting myotonic dystrophy is projected to experience robust growth, at a significant CAGR of 18.4% from 2020 to 2034. This dynamic expansion reflects increasing demand for advanced treatment options and underscores the growing investment in addressing this serious condition.

This deficiency can increase the risk of various health issues, most commonly presenting as COPD, including bronchiectasis, and liver diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatoma. In rarer cases, it can also lead to a skin disorder known as panniculitis. The total prevalent cases of AATD in the 7MM were ~224K in 2023. The prevalence of AATD in Japan is significantly lower than in Europe and the United States. As per estimates, in 2020, in the US, comorbidity associated with lung diseases was most common, occurring in around 77% of the total AATD cases, followed by other diseases and liver diseases. The current treatment options do not offer a cure. Augmentation therapy, also known as replacement therapy, is approved for the treatment of alpha-1-related lung disease. In the US, four augmentation therapy products are available: Grifols\u2019 PROLASTIN-C, Takeda\u2019s ARALAST, CSL Behring\u2019s ZEMAIRA, and Kamada/Takeda\u2019s GLASSIA . In certain European countries, AATD patients have access to RESPREEZA (ZEMAIRA in the US), PROLASTIN, PROLASTINA, PROLASPLAN, PLITALFA, and ALFALASTIN. In Japan, PROLASTIN-C is sold under the name LYNSPAD. PROLASTIN, produced by Grifols, is the market leader in AATD augmentation therapies, according to 2023 sales data. The pipeline for AATD consists an innovative therapies including an immunomodulator (serine peptidase inhibitor), neutrophil elastase enzyme inhibitor, RNA editing therapy, gene therapies, and others. As per DelveInsight analysis, among the 7MM, the US accounted for the largest market size of AATD. i.e., USD ~700 million in 2023. Ongoing research and an increase in disease understanding have led to the identification of therapies with effective and convenient routes of administration, including subcutaneous, inhalation, and oral, with the potential to improve patient\u2019s quality of life, setting the stage for market expansion and reshaping patient expectations and treatment experiences.

These mutations lead to a deficiency of neurofibromin, a regulator of RAS activity, which in turn causes the formation of plexiform neurofibromas\u2014peripheral nerve sheath tumors that significantly affect the health and quality of life of those affected. In 2023, the total diagnosed prevalent cases of NF1 were around 97K in the US, and these cases are anticipated to increase by 2034. The rise in NF1 cases can be attributed to improved awareness, advancements in diagnostic techniques, and increased genetic testing accessibility. Among the 7MM, the US accounted for the highest number of cases in 2023, with around 39K diagnosed prevalent cases of NF1-PN. These cases are expected to increase during the forecast period. The treatment options for NF1-PN have traditionally been limited to surgical procedures, primarily complete resection or debulking. However, the tumors\u2019 size and location often make these methods challenging, with many considered inoperable due to their proximity to critical structures or their invasive nature. Around 50% of patients with NF1-PN have tumors that cannot be safely removed without significant risk of complications, requiring a focus on managing symptoms rather than offering curative surgery. Surgery remains the preferred option for NF1-PN when possible. While complete resection is ideal, it is rarely achievable due to the tumors' complex relationship with nerves and blood vessels. Debulking may reduce symptoms but does not ensure long-term relief, as the tumors often regrow. The decision to pursue surgery depends on a comprehensive assessment of the tumor's characteristics and the patient\u2019s overall health. The approval of KOSELUGO , a selective MEK1/2 inhibitor, in 2020 represented a major shift in the treatment approach for pediatric patients with symptomatic, inoperable NF1-PN. KOSELUGO is currently the only FDA-approved treatment specifically for this condition. The total market size of NF1-PN in the 7MM was around USD 380 million in 2023. This is estimated to increase by 2034. Among the forecasted emerging therapies, mirdametinib is expected to capture the highest market in the 7MM by 2034. The landscape for treating NF1-PN is evolving rapidly as research continues to uncover the genetic underpinnings of these tumors.

Zacks Equity Research Fri, Dec 13, 2024, 2:47 PM 4 min read In This Article: CLB -1.50% Core Laboratories Inc. CLB is an oilfield services firm, operating in more than 50 countries, providing reservoir management and production enhancement to oil and gas companies. Despite a challenging market, CLB's shares have risen 11.8% year to date (\u201cYTD\u201d), outperforming the broader oil and energy sector's 5.6% growth. Additionally, CLB has not only surpassed the Field Services sub-industry but has also outperformed competitors like Drilling Tools International Corporation DTI, Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc. HLX and RPC, Inc. RES. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research But what is driving this performance and should investors be excited about the future of CLB? Let us take a deeper look at the key factors pushing CLB stock upward and the risks to keep an eye on. What Is Favoring CLB Stock? Promising Earnings Growth: The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates that CLB\u2019s earnings per share are expected to be 89 cents for 2024 and $1.11 for 2025. This translates to impressive year-over-year growth of 11.25% and 23.97%, respectively. The optimistic outlook indicates the company\u2019s strong fundamentals and growth potential. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Robust Financials & Cash Flow: CLB reported a sequential improvement in key financial metrics for third-quarter 2024, including a revenue rise of 7.2% year over year and 3% sequentially to $134.4 million coupled with $10.4 million free cash flow generation. Such financial discipline along with a debt reduction of $11.8 million, has brought the company\u2019s leverage ratio to its lowest level in six years. This highlights management's ability to create a resilient balance sheet, which is attractive for investors seeking financial stability. Innovative and Proprietary Technologies: CLB is recognized for its industry-leading technologies, including the Pulverizor for plug-and-abandonment operations and the company\u2019s Flow Profiler diagnostic solutions for unconventional reservoirs. These innovations not only address pressing industry challenges but also align with global trends toward cost reduction and operational efficiency. The successful deployment of these technologies can lead to deeper client engagement and higher-margin opportunities. Positioned to Benefit From Long-Term Energy Trends: CLB is strategically aligned with long-term industry tailwinds, such as growing global crude oil demand and underinvestment in exploration and development. Organizations like OPEC+ and the IEA forecast rising crude demand through 2025, boosting the need for CLB's services. The company\u2019s focus on reservoir data and analytics supports operators in reducing risks for high-stakes international offshore projects. Story Continues While CLB has demonstrated strong performance and promising growth potential, several risks could affect its future trajectory. Potential Red Flags for CLB Stock Vulnerability to Geopolitical and Climate Risks: CLB's operations are vulnerable to external disruptions, such as geopolitical conflicts and extreme weather events. The Gulf of Mexico hurricanes in the recent quarter delayed significant projects, resulting in a temporary decline in diagnostic services revenues within the Production Enhancement segment. Geopolitical tensions in regions like the Middle East also continue to pose operational risks, potentially affecting project timelines and profitability. Weakness in U.S. Onshore Activity: The U.S. land market, a key area for Core Laboratories\u2019 Production Enhancement segment, has been facing headwinds due to low natural gas prices and industry consolidation. This contributed to a decline in domestic product sales during third-quarter 2024. With U.S. onshore activity expected to trend lower in the near term, Core Laboratories\u2019 exposure to this segment may weigh on its overall performance. Competitive and Fragmented Market Dynamics: CLB operates in a highly competitive landscape, particularly within the Production Enhancement segment. The perforating market, for instance, is crowded with players offering similar solutions, pressuring margins. CLB\u2019s ability to maintain pricing power and differentiate its offerings will be critical to the company\u2019s success. Dependency on Oil Price Volatility: Core Laboratories' performance is closely tied to crude oil prices, which remain volatile due to global economic and geopolitical uncertainties. A downturn in oil prices could reduce exploration and production activities, directly impacting demand for the company\u2019s services. Final Thoughts for CLB Stock CLB has demonstrated strong growth potential, backed by solid earnings, a healthy balance sheet and innovative technologies. The company\u2019s impressive YTD performance makes it an attractive investment for those seeking growth in the oilfield services sector. However, investors should be cautious of key risks, including geopolitical instability, oil price volatility and challenges in the U.S. onshore market, which could impact future performance. Investors should consider the company's strengths alongside the potential challenges in the market. Given the uncertainties, investors who already have this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock in their portfolios can stay put, while new investors should wait for a more opportune entry point.
