[{"text": "BKU's Q4 Earnings Beat on Higher NII & Lower Provisions, Stock Down Zacks Equity Research Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 3:46 PM 4 min read In This Article: BKU -3.16% BankUnited, Inc. \u2019s BKU fourth-quarter 2024 earnings of 91 cents per share handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 71 cents. The bottom line compares favorably with 27 cents in the prior-year quarter. Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar. Results were aided by growth in net interest income (NII) and non-interest income alongside lower non-interest expenses and provisions. Also, stable deposits were another positive. However, a fall in loan balance and weak asset quality were the undermining factors. Shares of BKU declined 1.4% during Wednesday\u2019s trading session in light of these negatives. Net income totaled $69.3 million, jumping from $20.8 million a year ago. Our estimate for the metric was $50.9 million. For 2024, earnings per share (EPS) of $3.08 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.89. The figure represents a rise of 29.4% from the previous year. Net income was $232.5 million, up from $178.7 million. Our estimate for net income was $214 million. BankUnited\u2019s Revenues Grow, Expenses Decline Quarterly net revenues were $264.5 million, up 12.9% year over year. Moreover, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $259.7 million. Full-year net revenues were $1.01 billion, up 5.5% year over year. The top line met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. NII was $239.3 million, growing 10.2%. We projected NII to be $234.8 million. Net interest margin (NIM) expanded 24 basis points (bps) to 2.84%. Our estimate for the metric was 2.78%. Non-interest income of $25.2 million jumped 47.5% from the prior-year quarter. The rise was driven by an increase in lease financing and other non-interest income. We had projected a non-interest income of $22.1 million. Non-interest expenses fell 15.9% to $160.5 million. The decline was driven by a fall in deposit insurance expenses and the depreciation of operating lease equipment. Our estimate for non-interest expenses was $181.9 million. As of Dec. 31, 2024, total loans were $24.3 billion, down marginally from the prior quarter. Total deposits amounted to $27.9 billion, stable with the prior quarter. Our estimates for total loans and total deposits were $25.4 billion and $26.5 billion, respectively. BKU\u2019s Credit Quality Deteriorates In the reported quarter, BankUnited recorded a provision of credit losses of $11 million, which plunged 42.9% from the prior-year quarter. We had expected the metric to be $6.2 million. As of Dec. 31, 2024, the ratio of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.16%, up 7 bps year over year. Also, the non-performing assets ratio was 0.73%, jumping 36 bps. Story Continues BKU\u2019s Capital & Profitability Ratios Improve As of Dec. 31, 2024, the Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 12%, up from 11.4%. The total risk-based capital ratio was 14.1%, increasing from 13.4% as of Dec. 31, 2023. At the end of the fourth quarter, the return on average assets was 0.78%, up from 0.23% in the year-earlier quarter. Return on average stockholders\u2019 equity was 9.7%, rising from 3.2%. Our View on BankUnited Stock BankUnited\u2019s efforts to grow fee income, low-cost deposits and relatively higher interest rates are expected to support revenue growth. However, an increase in expenses and significant exposure to commercial real estate and residential loans might affect financials. BankUnited, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise BankUnited, Inc.

Performance of BankUnited\u2019s Peers Zions Bancorporation \u2019s ZION fourth-quarter 2024 EPS of $1.34 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.26. Moreover, the bottom line surged 71.8% from the year-ago quarter. ZION\u2019s results were primarily aided by higher NII and non-interest income. Also, higher loans and deposits were other positives.

Research Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 4:59 PM 4 min read In This Article: VLYPN -2.22% Valley National Bancorp \u2019s VLY fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 13 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents. Further, the bottom line plunged 40.9% on a year-over-year basis. Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar. A substantial rise in provisions on year-over-year basis, lower non-interest income, higher adjusted expenses and a sequential decline in loans and deposit balance affected the results. Nonetheless, a rise in net interest income (NII) supported the results. Results excluded non-core income and charges. After considering these, net income was $115.7 million, up 61.7% from the year-ago quarter. For 2024, adjusted earnings of 62 cents per share missed the consensus estimate of 64 cents and declined 41.5% year over year. Net income available to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $358.9 million or 69 cents per share, down from $482.4 million or 95 cents per share in 2023. Valley National\u2019s Revenues Rise, Adjusted Expenses Up Quarterly total revenues were $474.2 million, up 5.4% year over year. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $469.5 million. For 2024, total revenues fell 2% to $1.85 billion. Nonetheless, the top line met the consensus estimate. NII (fully-taxable-equivalent or FTE basis) was $424.3 million, up 6.4%. Net interest margin (FTE basis) was 2.92%, up 10 basis points (bps). Non-interest income declined 2.8% to $51.2 million. The fall was due to lower net gains on securities transactions, and net losses on sales of loans alongside a decrease in bank owned life insurance and other income. Non-interest expenses of $278.6 million declined 18.2%. Meanwhile, adjusted non-interest expenses rose 1.2% to $275.8 million. The adjusted efficiency ratio was 57.21%, down from 60.70% in the prior-year quarter. A decline in the efficiency ratio indicates an improvement in profitability. VLY\u2019s Loans & Deposits As of Dec. 31, 2024, total loans were $48.8 billion, down 1.1% sequentially. The fall was mainly due to repayment activity within commercial real estate (CRE) non-owner occupied and multifamily loan categories during the quarter. Further, on Dec. 3, 2024, Valley National sold the abovementioned CRE loans at a nominal discount of roughly 1% to Brookfield Asset Management BAM for about $823 million. Out of these loans sold to BAM, nearly $151 million and $76 million of CRE loans and residential mortgage loans, respectively, were not identified as loans held for sale on Sept. 30, 2024. As of Dec. 31, 2024, total deposits amounted to $50.1 billion, down marginally from the prior quarter. Story Continues Valley National\u2019s Credit Quality Worsens As of Dec. 31, 2024, total non-performing assets were $373.3 million, up 27.2% year over year. Provision for credit losses for loans was $106.5 million, rising substantially from $20.6 million. Allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.17%, up 24 bps from the year-ago quarter. VLY\u2019s Profitability Ratios Deteriorate, Capital Ratios Rise At the end of the fourth quarter, adjusted annualized return on average assets was 0.48%, down from 0.76% in the year-earlier quarter. Adjusted annualized return on average shareholders\u2019 equity was 4.17%, down from 7.01%. VLY's tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.40% as of Dec. 31, 2024, up from 7.58% in the corresponding period of 2023. Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.55%, up from 9.72%. Also, the common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 10.82% was up from 9.29% as of Dec. 31, 2023. Our Take on Valley National Valley National\u2019s organic growth trajectory, strategic acquisitions and solid balance sheet will support its financials. However, persistently increasing costs and weakening asset quality remain major concerns. Further, the company\u2019s huge CRE loan exposure is worrisome.

Performance of VLY\u2019s Peers BankUnited, Inc. \u2019s BKU fourth-quarter 2024 earnings of 91 cents per share handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 71 cents. The bottom line compared favorably with 27 cents in the prior-year quarter. BKU\u2019s results were aided by growth in NII and non-interest income alongside lower non-interest expenses and provisions. Stable deposits were another positive. However, a fall in loan balance and weak asset quality were the undermining factors. Bank OZK \u2019s OZK fourth-quarter 2024 EPS of $1.56 handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.45. The bottom line reflected a rise of 4% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s actual. Results benefited from a rise in NII, driven by improvement in loans and deposit balances. Lower non-interest expenses and provisions were also positives. However, lower non-interest income and rising funding costs were the undermining factors for OZK.

The company achieved a notable reduction in the cost of deposits, with interest-bearing deposit costs declining by 45 basis points. Non-interest bearing demand deposits (NIDDA) grew by $781 million for the year, contributing to a healthier deposit mix. BankUnited Inc ( NYSE:BKU ) maintained a solid credit profile with net charge-offs at 16 basis points, which is considered strong for a commercial bank. Negative Points Loan growth was impacted by higher-than-expected payoffs, leading to a $101 million decline in loans for the quarter. The company experienced a $26 million increase in non-performing loans due to one office loan, highlighting potential vulnerabilities in the office loan portfolio. There is increased competition in the lending market, leading to tighter spreads and potential pressure on margins. The company anticipates some pressure on net interest margin in the first quarter of 2025 due to the roll-off of hedges. BankUnited Inc ( NYSE:BKU ) faces uncertainties related to policy changes and competition, which could impact future performance. Q & A Highlights Q : Can you provide guidance on net interest income (NII) growth for the upcoming year? A : Leslie Lunak, CFO: Last year, NII grew by 5%. For next year, we are projecting mid to high single-digit growth. Story Continues Q : How do you plan to address potential challenges in deposit gathering given the current competitive environment? A : Rajinder Singh, CEO: We are confident in demand deposit growth due to strong pipelines and mandates. While competition may increase for interest-bearing deposits, we have successfully reduced costs in this area recently. The main competition is on the lending side, with tighter spreads and banks returning to non-relationship business. Q : What is the outlook for wholesale funding and the overall balance sheet growth? A : Rajinder Singh, CEO: We have significantly reduced wholesale borrowings and do not expect much further reduction. The balance sheet will likely grow slightly, but not significantly. Q : Can you discuss the seasonality and expectations for loan growth, particularly in the C&I segment? A : Leslie Lunak, CFO: Loan production is typically lighter in the first quarter and ramps up later in the year. The flatness in Q4 was due to unpredictable payoffs, but production levels and pipelines remain strong. Q : What are your thoughts on potential regulatory changes and their impact on the bank? A : Rajinder Singh, CEO: We have no major complaints about current regulations. However, the slowdown in M&A approvals is concerning as it impacts the system and communities. A more business-oriented regulatory environment would benefit our clients and the industry. For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .

as NII Rises, Provisions Fall Zacks Equity Research Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 3:34 PM 5 min read In This Article: ASB -2.67% Associated Banc-Corp \u2019s ASB fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of 57 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents. Also, the bottom line compared favorably with 53 cents earned in the prior-year quarter. See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news. Results benefited from an increase in net interest income (NII) and adjusted non-interest income. A rise in deposit balance and lower provisions acted as tailwinds. However, higher adjusted expenses were the undermining factor. Results excluded certain non-recurring items. After considering these, the net loss available to common shareholders was $164.5 million or $1.03 per share, compared with a net loss of $93.7 million or 62 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. For 2024, adjusted earnings of $2.38 per share beat the consensus estimate of $2.15 and rose 5% year over year. Net income available to common shareholders (GAAP) was $111.6 million or 72 cents per share, down from $171.5 million or $1.13 per share in the year-ago quarter. ASB\u2019s Adjusted Revenues Rise, Adjusted Expenses Up Total adjusted revenues (FTE basis) for the quarter were $345.8 million, up 5% year over year. Also, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $343.3 million. For 2024, total adjusted revenues grew marginally to $1.33 billion. The top line also outpaced the consensus estimate of $1.32 billion. NII was $270.3 million, up 7%. The net interest margin was 2.81%, up 12 basis points (bps) year over year. The increase was driven by a fall in average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities. We had expected NII and net interest yield to be $268.3 million and 2.84%, respectively. The non-interest loss was $206.8 million in the reported quarter compared with a loss of $131 million in the prior-year quarter. Excluding the loss on mortgage portfolio sale and investment securities loss, adjusted non-interest income came in at $71.8 million, rising 2%. Our estimate for the non-interest income was $65 million. Non-interest expenses decreased 6% to $224.3 million. These included certain non-recurring charges. Excluding these, adjusted expenses were $210 million, up marginally. Our estimate for non-interest expenses was $205.4 million and did not include the abovementioned non-recurring charge. The adjusted FTE efficiency ratio was 61.11%, down from 64.12% in the prior-year quarter. A fall in the efficiency ratio indicates an improvement in profitability. Associated Banc-Corp\u2019s Loans Dip, Deposits Rise As of Dec. 31, 2024, total loans were $29.8 billion, down 1% from the prior quarter. The fall was attributable to the sale of $723 million in residential mortgages associated with the balance sheet repositioning. Our estimate for total loans was $30.4 million. On the other hand, total deposits grew 3% to $34.6 billion. Our estimate for total deposits was $34.5 million. Story Continues Associated Banc-Corp\u2019s Credit Quality Improves In the reported quarter, the company recorded a provision for credit losses of $17 million, down 19% from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for the metric was $22 million. As of Dec. 31, 2024, total non-performing assets were $144.2 million, down 10%. Total non-accrual loans were $123.3 million, falling 17%. Net charge-offs were $12.2 million, down 22% from the prior-year quarter. Associated Banc-Corp\u2019s Capital Ratios Improve As of Dec. 31, 2024, the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 10.57%, up from 9.99% recorded in the corresponding period of 2023. The common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 10%, up from 9.39%. Associated Banc-Corp\u2019s Outlook for 2025 Management expects loans to grow at the rate of 5-6%. Total core customer deposits are estimated to rise in the range of 4-5%, while total deposits are projected to increase 1-2%. NII is projected to jump in the 12-13% range. After adjusting to exclude the impact of non-recurring items related to the balance sheet repositioning announced in the fourth quarter of 2024, total non-interest income is expected to be stable or grow 1%. After adjusting to exclude the impact of the loss on prepayments of FHLB advances, total non-interest expenses are likely to rise 3-4%. The effective tax rate is expected to be 19-21%. Our Take on ASB Associated Banc-Corp\u2019s business restructuring efforts are likely to keep supporting financials. The company has a solid balance sheet position, making it well-poised for growth. However, mounting expenses are a headwind. Associated Banc-Corp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Associated Banc-Corp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Associated Banc-Corp price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Associated Banc-Corp Quote ASB currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Performance of ASB\u2019s Peers BankUnited, Inc. \u2019s BKU fourth-quarter 2024 earnings of 91 cents per share handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 71 cents. The bottom line compares favorably with 27 cents in the prior-year quarter. BKU\u2019s results were aided by growth in NII and non-interest income alongside lower non-interest expenses and provisions. Also, stable deposits were another positive. However, a fall in loan balance and weak asset quality were the undermining factors. Commerce Bancshares Inc. CBSH reported fourth-quarter 2024 earnings per share of $1.01, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents. The bottom line also jumped 27.8% from the prior-year quarter. Results benefited from a rise in NII and non-interest income. Also, stable adjusted expenses posed a tailwind. However, a substantial jump in provisions hurt CBSH\u2019s results to some extent.

Aerospace and energy sectors show strong growth, while automation and control indicate stabilization. Story Continues Q : How do you view incremental leverage in the Transportation Solutions (TS) segment during a recovery? A : We've improved TS margins significantly, aiming for 20% or better. The commercial transportation business, currently depressed, will provide leverage as it recovers. We've optimized our footprint, especially in Europe, reducing fixed costs, allowing us to maintain margins even in low-growth environments. Q : What is driving the strength in AI revenues, and how should we think about the margin profile of AI? A : AI revenue doubled in the quarter, with broad participation from hyperscalers and semiconductor players. Our share remains stable at 30-35%. The margin profile is similar to our cloud products, with volume benefits expected as we scale. Q : Can you discuss your strategy if tariffs are implemented and your approach to M&A given strong cash flow? A : Our manufacturing is localized, with 80% in-region, aligning with customer supply chains. We've dealt with tariffs before, using a playbook involving logistics adjustments and cost recovery through pricing. For M&A, we're focused on bolt-on acquisitions in familiar areas, with an active pipeline and enhanced resources for opportunities. Q : Can you elaborate on the stabilization in industrial markets and the outlook for medical business? A : Industrial markets show stabilization, with positive order momentum in Asia, sideways trends in the US, and weakness in Europe. The medical business decline was due to inventory normalization, but we expect sequential growth as orders improve.

Reports 2024 Results Business Wire Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 2:45 PM 17 min read In This Article: BKU -3.16% MIAMI LAKES, Fla., January 22, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--BankUnited, Inc. (the \"Company\") (NYSE: BKU) today announced financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2024. \"We are very excited about the momentum we've generated and the improvement we've seen in the funding base and profitability profile of the Company over the course of 2024,\" said Rajinder Singh, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. For the quarter ended December 31, 2024, the Company reported net income of $69.3 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, compared to $61.5 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, for the immediately preceding quarter ended September 30, 2024 and $20.8 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company reported net income of $232.5 million, or $3.08 per diluted share, compared to $178.7 million, or $2.38 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2023. Results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023 were negatively impacted by a $35.4 million FDIC special assessment, pre-tax. This item reduced net income by $26.2 million and EPS by $0.35 for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. Quarterly Highlights We continue to execute on strategic priorities focused on improving core profitability. EPS, the net interest margin, ROAA and ROAE have improved notably since the fourth quarter of 2023, as well as for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The net interest margin, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, expanded by 0.06% to 2.84% for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 from 2.78% for the immediately preceding quarter and by 0.24% from 2.60% for the comparable quarter of the prior year. Average non-interest bearing demand deposits (\"NIDDA\") for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 exceeded our expectations and we made outstanding progress reducing the cost of interest bearing deposits. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the net interest margin improved to 2.73% from 2.56% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The average cost of total deposits declined by 0.34% to 2.72% for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 from 3.06% for the immediately preceding quarter ended September 30, 2024, while the average cost of interest bearing deposits declined by 0.45% to 3.75% from 4.20% for those same comparable periods. The spot APY of total deposits declined to 2.63% at December 31, 2024 from 2.93% at September 30, 2024 while the spot APY of interest bearing deposits declined to 3.58% at December 31, 2024 from 4.01% at September 30, 2024. Story Continues Average NIDDA grew by $173 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 compared to the immediately preceding quarter and by $648 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. On a point-to-point basis, NIDDA grew by $781 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and was relatively flat, declining by only $19 million in spite of seasonal headwinds, for the fourth quarter of 2024. At December 31, 2024, NIDDA was 27% of total deposits. Wholesale funding, including FHLB advances and brokered deposits, declined by $346 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2024, wholesale funding declined by $2.3 billion. Total deposits was relatively flat quarter over quarter, growing by $9.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2024, total deposits grew by $1.3 billion; non-brokered deposits grew by $1.4 billion. Total loans declined by $101 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2024. The core CRE and C&I segments grew by $185 million and mortgage warehouse grew by $14 million. Consistent with our balance sheet strategy, the residential, franchise, equipment and municipal finance portfolios declined by a combined $299 million. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the core CRE and C&I segments grew by $470 million, mortgage warehouse grew by $153 million and the residential, franchise, equipment and municipal finance portfolios declined by a combined $959 million. The pace of C&I growth over the course of 2024 was impacted by an increased level of payoffs and rationalization of non-relationship credits. The loan to deposit ratio declined to 87.2% at December 31, 2024, from 87.6% at September 30, 2024 and 92.8% at December 31, 2023. Total criticized and classified commercial loans declined by $75.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, however, non-performing loans increased by $26.2 million, primarily related to one CRE office loan. The NPA ratio was 0.73%, including 0.10% related to the guaranteed portion of non-accrual SBA loans, at December 31, 2024 compared to 0.64%, including 0.10% related to the guaranteed portion of non-accrual SBA loans at September 30, 2024. The net charge-off ratio for the year ended December 31, 2024 was 0.16%. The ratio of the ACL to total loans was 0.92% at December 31, 2024; the ratio of the ACL to non-performing loans was 89.01%. The ACL to loans ratio for commercial portfolio sub-segments including C&I, CRE, franchise finance and equipment finance was 1.37% at December 31, 2024 and the ACL to loans ratio for CRE office loans was 2.30%. Our commercial real estate exposure totaled 26% of loans and 169% of the Bank's total risk based capital at December 31, 2024. By comparison, based on call report data as of September 30, 2024 (the most recent date available) for banks with between $10 billion and $100 billion in assets, the median level of CRE to total loans was 35% and the median level of CRE to total risk based capital was 222%. At December 31, 2024, the weighted average LTV of the CRE portfolio was 55.0%, the weighted average DSCR was 1.76, 54% of the portfolio was collateralized by properties located in Florida and 25% was collateralized by properties located in the New York tri-state area. For the office sub-segment, the weighted average LTV was 65.2%, the weighted average DSCR was 1.57, 57% was collateralized by properties in Florida, substantially all of which was suburban, and 23% was collateralized by properties located in the New York tri-state area. Our capital position is robust. At December 31, 2024, CET1 was 12.0% at a consolidated level. Pro-forma CET1, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was 10.9% at December 31, 2024.

The CRE portfolio grew by $227 million and MWL grew by $14 million while the C&I portfolio declined by $43 million. Consistent with our balance sheet strategy, residential loans declined by $207 million; the franchise, equipment, and municipal finance portfolios declined by an aggregate $93 million. Asset Quality and the ACL The following table presents information about the ACL at the dates indicated as well as net charge-off rates for the periods ended December 31, 2024, September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands): ACL ACL to Total Loans Commercial ACL to Commercial Loans (2) ACL to Non- Performing Loans Net Charge-offs to Average Loans (1) December 31, 2023 $ 202,689 0.82 % 1.29 % 159.54 % 0.09 % September 30, 2024 $ 228,249 0.94 % 1.41 % 101.68 % 0.12 % December 31, 2024 $ 223,153 0.92 % 1.37 % 89.01 % 0.16 ___________________________ (1) Annualized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024; ratios for December 31, 2024 and 2023 are annual net charge-off rates. (2) For purposes of this ratio, commercial loans includes the core C&I and CRE sub-segments as presented in the table above as well as franchise and equipment finance. Due to their unique risk profiles, MWL and municipal finance are excluded from this ratio. The decline in the ACL coverage ratios at December 31, 2024 as compared to the prior quarter-end is related to C&I charge-offs during the quarter, the majority of which were previously reserved for. The ACL at December 31, 2024 represents management's estimate of lifetime expected credit losses given an assessment of historical data, current conditions, and a reasonable and supportable economic forecast as of the balance sheet date. For the quarter ended December 31, 2024, the provision for credit losses, including both funded and unfunded loan commitments, was $11.0 million, compared to $9.2 million for the immediately preceding quarter ended September 30, 2024 and $19.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The most significant factor leading to the decrease in ACL for the quarter was net charge offs; this reduction was partially offset by increases in specific reserves, the impact of the economic forecast and an increase in qualitative overlays. Three C&I loans accounted for substantially all of the charge-offs for the quarter. The following table summarizes the activity in the ACL for the periods indicated (in thousands): Three Months Ended Years Ended December 31, 2024 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 December 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 Beginning balance $ 228,249 $ 225,698 $ 196,063 $ 202,689 $ 147,946 Impact of adoption of new accounting pronouncement (ASU 2022-02) N/A N/A N/A N/A (1,794 ) Balance after impact of adoption of ASU 2022-02 228,249 225,698 196,063 202,689 146,152 Provision 12,267 9,091 16,257 58,986 78,924 Net charge-offs (17,363 ) (6,540 ) (9,631 ) (38,522 ) (22,387 ) Ending balance $ 223,153 $ 228,249 $ 202,689 $ 223,153 $ 202,689 As detailed in the following table, criticized and classified commercial loans declined by $75.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 (in thousands): December 31, 2024 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 CRE Total Commercial CRE Total Commercial CRE Total Commercial Special mention $ 58,771 $ 262,387 $ 145,338 $ 323,326 $ 97,552 $ 319,905 Substandard - accruing 633,614 894,754 587,097 932,746 390,724 711,266 Substandard - non-accruing 95,378 219,758 70,860 186,565 13,727 86,903 Doubtful \u2014 6,856 \u2014 16,265 \u2014 19,035 Total $ 787,763 $ 1,383,755 $ 803,295 $ 1,458,902 $ 502,003 $ 1,137,109 Non-performing loans totaled $250.7 million or 1.03% of total loans at December 31, 2024, compared to $224.5 million or 0.92% of total loans at September 30, 2024. The increase in non-performing loans for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 related primarily to one CRE office loan. Non-performing loans included $34.3 million and $35.1 million of the guaranteed portion of SBA loans on non-accrual status, representing 0.14% of total loans at both December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2024. Net Interest Income Net interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 was $239.3 million, compared to $234.1 million for the immediately preceding quarter ended September 30, 2024, and $217.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Interest income decreased by $24.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, compared to the immediately preceding quarter, while interest expense decreased by $29.5 million. The Company\u2019s net interest margin, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, increased by 0.06% to 2.84% for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, from 2.78% for the immediately preceding quarter ended September 30, 2024. Factors impacting the net interest margin for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 were: The average rate paid on interest bearing deposits declined to 3.75% for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, from 4.20% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. This decline reflected initiatives taken to lower rates paid on deposits in response to declines in the Fed Funds rate and the re-pricing of term deposits. The average rate paid on FHLB advances declined to 3.82% for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, from 4.27% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, reflecting the repayment or repricing of predominantly shorter term high rate advances. The tax-equivalent yield on loans declined to 5.60% for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, from 5.87% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 reflecting the impact of declining market rates on the predominantly floating rate commercial portfolio. The tax-equivalent yield on investments declined to 5.31% for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, from 5.62% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. This decrease resulted primarily from the reset of coupon rates on variable rate securities. Overall, the reduction in cost of interest bearing liabilities outpaced the decline in the yield on interest earning assets. Non-interest income and Non-interest expense Lease financing: Declines in both lease financing income and depreciation of operating lease equipment for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 corresponded with the reduction in the portfolio of operating lease equipment. Quarterly fluctuations in lease financing income may be caused by variability in residual income. Other non-interest income: Year-over-year increases in other non-interest income include increases in loan related and syndication fees, commercial card revenue and income related to bank owned life insurance. Employee compensation and benefits: Year-over-year increases in compensation relate to investments we are making in people to support future growth of the commercial business, regular merit increases, and increased variable compensation cost, related in part to an increase in the Company's stock price. As discussed above, non-interest expense for the year and three months ended December 31, 2023 included a $35.4 million FDIC special assessment. Railcar refurbishment costs of approximately $8 million that we had expected to incur in the fourth quarter of 2024 did not materialize, and are expected instead to occur in 2025.
