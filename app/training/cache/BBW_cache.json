[{"text": "LIVE The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs Estimating The Fair Value Of Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc. (NYSE:BBW) editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 10:38 PM 6 min read In This Article: BBW Key Insights Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Build-A-Bear Workshop fair value estimate is US$47.88 Build-A-Bear Workshop's US$41.08 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate Our fair value estimate is 12% lower than Build-A-Bear Workshop's analyst price target of US$54.33 In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc. ( NYSE:BBW ) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex. Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Build-A-Bear Workshop The Calculation We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Seeing as no analyst estimates of free cash flow are available to us, we have extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the company's last reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$38.2m US$35.2m US$33.6m US$32.8m US$32.4m US$32.5m US$32.8m US$33.2m US$33.8m US$34.5m Growth Rate Estimate Source Est @ -12.23% Est @ -7.77% Est @ -4.66% Est @ -2.47% Est @ -0.95% Est @ 0.12% Est @ 0.87% Est @ 1.40% Est @ 1.76% Est @ 2.02% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1% US$35.6 US$30.7 US$27.3 US$24.9 US$23.0 US$21.5 US$20.2 US$19.1 US$18.2 US$17.3 (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$238m After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.6%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.1%. Story Continues Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$34m\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (7.1%\u2013 2.6%) = US$782m Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = US$782m\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.1%) 10 = US$392m The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$630m. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$41.1, the company appears about fair value at a 14% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. NYSE:BBW Discounted Cash Flow January 23rd 2025 The Assumptions We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Build-A-Bear Workshop as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.099. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for Build-A-Bear Workshop Strength Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry. Currently debt free. Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows. Weakness Earnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average. Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Specialty Retail market. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years. Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value. Threat Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market. Moving On: Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Stocks with Great Five-Year Returns John Dorfman Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 7:28 PM 4 min read January 27, 2024 (Maple Hill Syndicate) For years, my mentor, David Dreman ( Trades , Portfolio ), invested in Westinghouse Electric Co. The stock was cheap, often selling for about nine times the company's per-share earnings. The stock price marched up nicely, yet the stock stayed cheap, because earnings were rising as fast as the stock price. That's a value investor's dream. Today, Westinghouse is in the dust bin of history, and Dreman is mostly retired. But I long to find today's version of what I call the Westinghouse Effect. Here are a few possible candidates. These six stocks are relatively cheap, and have achieved total returns of more than 500% over the five years through January 23. Core Natural Core Natural Resources Inc. ( NYSE:CNR ), a coal company of all things, has returned 951% over the past five years. Core was formed January 15 of this year by the merger of Consol Energy Inc. and Arch Resources Inc. The 951% figure cited above is for shareholders who originally held Consol. Arch shareholders didn't do badly either: They got between a double and a triple. The great investor Charlie Munger once said that value investors run the risk of holding a melting ice cube. You can make an argument that coal companies are just that. My view is different. Although coal is a highly polluting fuel, it is an important one, and probably for the next decade a necessary one. I like Core's balance sheet. It has more than two dollars in cash for every dollar of debt. Debt is only 13% of the company's net worth. The stock sells for seven times earnings. Build-a-Bear Maybe your young kids had a birthday party sometimes at Build-a-Bear, a store where they can choose a stuffed animal, fill it at a stuffing machine, and buy clothes for it too. Five years ago, Build-a-Bear was in tough shape, and bankruptcy rumors flew. The pandemic had hit the company hard. People stopped going to malls, and all 400 of its stores were closed for a while. Yet, Build-a-Bear Workshop Inc. ( NYSE:BBW ) has achieved a five-year return of 817%. It's an example of the wisdom in mutual-fund legend John Templeton's admonition to buy at the point of maximum pain. Dillard's Who says department stores are dinosaurs? You can't prove it by Dillard's Inc. ( NYSE:DDS ). Its shares have provided a 752% return in the past five years, when most department-store stocks have been flat to down. About a month ago, Fortune magazine ran a feature on the company by Phil Wahba, which pointed out that Dillard's stock has beaten Tesla, Apple and Microsoft over the past four years. He called the chain old fashioned, but noted that service is good and the stores intelligently located. Story Continues The company's service territory is the South and Southwest, the faster-growing part of the U.S. I've recommended the stock several times in this column over the years. Cooper Group Mr. Cooper Group Inc. ( NASDAQ:COOP ) is a mortgage lender and mortgage servicer based in Coppell, Texas. Its five year return: 684%. It's the largest mortgage servicer in the U.S., and that's significant because income from servicing is steadier than that from mortgage origination. The company had a major breach in 2023. Hackers stole personal information on some 15 million customers, including Social Security numbers and bank account numbers. Litigation stemming from the breach is still in progress. Nonetheless, six of the eight analysts who follow the stock recommend it. Abercrombie & Fitch Up 632% in the past five years is Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ( NYSE:ANF ), which sells clothing to teens and young adults. It's shown a profit in 14 of the past 15 years (the exception being pandemic-scarred fiscal 2021). Revenue and earnings growth has accelerated lately. Profit margins have usually been slender (as is typical of clothing retailers) but have improved lately. I like the stock, and have recommended it in this column several times. Riley Exploration The smallest stock I'll discuss today is Riley Exploration Permian Inc. ( REPX ). As its name suggests, it produces oil and gas in west Texas and eastern New Mexico, home of the Permian Basin. It has very little revenue until 2021, but now is up to $407 million revenue in the past four quarters. The stock chart shows a jagged pattern, with a five-year return of 512%. I'd consider the stock speculative. But I like the valuation, which is six times recent earnings and less than five times estimated earnings for 2025. Disclosure: I currently have no positions in the stocks discussed today, personally or for clients. John Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments in Boston, Massachusetts.

Guests create their own stuffed animals by participating in the stuffing, dressing, accessorizing, and naming of their own teddy bears and other plush toys based on the Company's own intellectual property and in conjunction with a variety of best-in-class licenses. The hands-on and interactive nature of our more than 500 company-owned, partner-operated and franchise experience locations around the world, combined with Build-A-Bear's pop-culture appeal, often fosters a lasting and emotional brand connection with consumers, and has enabled the Company to expand beyond its retail stores to include e-commerce sales on www.buildabear.com and non-plush branded consumer categories via out-bound licensing agreements with leading manufacturers, as well as the creation of engaging content via Build-A-Bear Entertainment (a subsidiary of Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc.). The brand's newest communications campaign, \"The Stuff You Love,\" commemorates more than a quarter-century of creating cherished memories worldwide. Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc. (NYSE: BBW) posted consolidated total revenues of $486.1 million for fiscal 2023. For more information, visit the Investor Relations section of buildabear.com.

2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Trethera Corporation (\u201cTrethera\u201d), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing novel drugs targeting nucleotide metabolism for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases, announces an upcoming poster presentation at the Crohn\u2019s & Colitis Congress (CCC) Annual Meeting. Drs. Peter M. Clark, of the University of California Los Angeles, and Kenneth A. Schultz, of Trethera, will present preclinical research highlighting the use of Trethera\u2019s deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) inhibitor, TRE-515, that suggests a functional role for nucleoside salvage and dCK in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) mouse models.

Figure 1: Representative H&E sections of intestinal tissue from an IBD mouse model without drug treatment showing a high degree of inflammatory cell activity (left) and with TRE-515 treatment with significantly less inflammation (right). Targeting dCK with first-in-class inhibitor TRE-515 is shown to block symptoms in an IBD mouse model by specifically limiting activated CD4 T cell proliferation. The CCC meeting is a specialized gathering of translational science experts highlighting notable, novel and rigorous scientific discoveries made in IBD that advance understanding of the clinical care of patients. TRE-515 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 dose escalation trial treating solid tumors. Presentation Details: Poster Title: First-in-Class Clinical Stage Deoxycytidine Kinase Inhibitor TRE-515 Blocks Inflammatory Bowel Disease in an Adoptive CD4 Cell Transfer Mouse Model Authors: Peter M. Clark, PhD; Kenneth A. Schultz, MD; K.M. Ryan, BS Poster Session: Congress Exhibit and Poster Hall Reception Date: Friday, February 7, 2025; 5PM \u2013 6:30PM Location: Congress Exhibit Hall, The Moscone Center in San Francisco, CA TRE-515 is an orally delivered first-in-class therapeutic engineered to inhibit dCK, the key enzyme in the nucleoside salvage pathway. A common characteristic of IBD is the aberrant proliferation of T and B cells that mistakenly recognize and attack intestinal cells in response to changes in gut bacteria. The abnormal clonal expansion of T and B cells during autoimmunity requires elevated levels of nucleotides \u2013 including those provided by nucleoside salvage and dCK \u2013 to support rapid cellular DNA replication necessary for accelerated division. In contrast, dCK activity is highly restricted in healthy adult human cells. By targeting dCK, scientists hope to selectively and effectively deprive abnormally activated immune cells of this needed nucleotide source, thereby ameliorating IBD progression and blocking symptoms of Crohn\u2019s disease. Likewise, cancer cells have the capability to upregulate dCK to increase the intracellular nucleotide pool providing the basic DNA precursors for rapid growth and cancer cell division. This CCC presentation builds on the research work first described in the journal Immunology by Chen et al. in 2023 (PMID: 35986643).

About Trethera Trethera is a clinical stage, privately held, biopharmaceutical company dedicated to pioneering the development of novel treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancers. Founded by prominent UCLA scientists, Trethera is led by experienced management and board members. Trethera's innovative approach to targeting nucleotide metabolism led to the development of TRE-515, an orally administered capsule twice designated by the FDA as an Orphan Drug. TRE-515 is a first-in-class clinical stage drug that inhibits deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), the rate-limiting enzyme in the nucleoside salvage pathway, one of two biosynthetic pathways that generate DNA precursors. It is believed that some forms of cancer may be preferentially dependent on the salvage pathway to support tumor growth, and certain autoimmune diseases might also respond to TRE-515 treatment. Trethera is developing TRE-515 for use as a monotherapy or in combination to precisely target a metabolic vulnerability of cancer or autoimmune diseases that will transform outcomes for patients.

About Inflammatory Bowel Disease There are two major types of inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn\u2019s and ulcerative colitis. Crohn\u2019s affects over 1 million Americans and has a high unmet medical need. Patients experience relapsing flares of disease activity that can cause fistulas and strictures, and an increased risk of colorectal cancer that can degrade quality of life. With its discontinuous areas of inflammation, Crohn\u2019s is generally not curable with surgery and so requires systemic drug therapies. Crohn\u2019s is driven by autoreactive CD4 T cells that target antigens in the gut with the involvement of additional immune cell types including macrophages and autoreactive B cells.

Trump's tariffs Is It Too Late To Consider Buying Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc. (NYSE:BBW)? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Mon, Dec 30, 2024, 2:29 PM 3 min read In This Article: BBW While Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc. ( NYSE:BBW ) might not have the largest market cap around , it led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. The company's trading levels have reached its high for the past year, following the recent bounce in the share price. As a small cap stock, which tends to lack high analyst coverage, there is generally more of an opportunity for mispricing as there is less activity to push the stock closer to fair value. Is there still an opportunity here to buy? Let\u2019s examine Build-A-Bear Workshop\u2019s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there\u2019s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for Build-A-Bear Workshop What Is Build-A-Bear Workshop Worth? According to our valuation model, Build-A-Bear Workshop seems to be fairly priced at around 4.1% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Build-A-Bear Workshop today, you\u2019d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $48.67, then there\u2019s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Build-A-Bear Workshop\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility. What does the future of Build-A-Bear Workshop look like? NYSE:BBW Earnings and Revenue Growth December 30th 2024 Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of Build-A-Bear Workshop, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 6.5%, which doesn\u2019t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn\u2019t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term. What This Means For You Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in BBW\u2019s future outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value? Are you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on BBW, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook means it\u2019s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.
