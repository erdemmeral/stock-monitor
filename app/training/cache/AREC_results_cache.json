[{"text": "American Resources Corporation's American Infrastructure Corporation Closes Merger with CGrowth Capital, Inc ACCESS Newswire \u00b7 American Resources Corporation American Resources Corporation Tue, Jan 28, 2025, 11:30 AM 6 min read In This Article: AREC +5.39% American Resources Corporation (NASDAQ:AREC) (\"American Resources\" or the \"Company\") announced that its partially owned subsidiary, American Infrastructure Corporation (\"AIC\"), a supplier of raw material to the infrastructure marketplace with a focus on iron ore, titanium and metallurgical carbon, has successfully completed its merger with CGrowth Capital, Inc. (OTC:CGRA) (\"CGrowth Capital\" or \"CGRA\"). In conjunction with the merger with CGRA, the Company has established a framework to support future financing for both organic growth and acquisitions within the infrastructure sector, in alignment with its overall business strategy. Mark Jensen, Executive Chairman of American Infrastructure Corporation, commented, \"Closing the previously announced binding agreement with CGrowth Capital represents a significant milestone for American Infrastructure and its shareholders. As a standalone public company focused on expanding its presence in the mining and infrastructure marketplace, our goal of building high-value royalty structures presents a substantial opportunity for both our shareholders and those of CGRA. We believe that, given the new administration's emphasis on energy and infrastructure growth, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the undercapitalized and distressed assets within the infrastructure marketplace. This is an opportune time to be a pure-play infrastructure company, especially with the increasing focus on domestic infrastructure initiatives in the United States. Our strategy remains centered on leveraging our royalty and leasehold production model, which enables us to generate cash flow by partnering with experienced local operators with a proven track record of success in the region. We are optimistic about the opportunities ahead in 2025 as we continue to grow the business. We also want to extend our gratitude to Nick Link and his team for their efforts establishing a strong platform like CGrowth Capital.\" Common shareholders of American Infrastructure, as consideration for the merger, will receive a Series A Preferred Stock in exchange for their common shares, which can be converted into common shares of the post-merger, combined company, American Infrastructure Holding Corporation, at the holder's discretion. Per the previously established record date, for the distribution of shares of American Infrastructure Corporation to the underlying shareholders of American Resources Corporation, those investors will now receive there prorate Series A Preferred Shares of CGrowth Capital, Inc. on February 14, 2025. Story Continues Under the terms of the Agreement, American Infrastructure Corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of CGrowth Capital, Inc., which will change its name to American Infrastructure Holding Corporation. The American Infrastructure team will assume management of CGRA and nominate new board members, with Nick Link, the former Chief Executive Officer of CGRA, remaining on the board of the combined entity. The previously existing operations and assets of CGRA will be spun-out of that entity concurrent with this transaction, leaving the operations of American Infrastructure Corporation as the sole operations of the combined entity. American Resources has received multiple term sheets and letters of interest for structured transactions over the last year for the American Infrastructure Corporation operations, ranging in value from $150 million to $280 million in total value to American Infrastructure. The structured nature of such previous transactions were not acceptable to the Board of Directors of American Infrasturure, and thus not enacted upon. The merger with CGRA is structured to reflect the growth opportunities and achieve such value for the combined entity, with the prospects of additional growth capital to unlock the company's value in the future.

Tate Sullivan, Senior Research Analyst at Maxim Group, will host virtual conversations with companies to identify future trends in mining and supplying critical minerals and precious metals. We believe the U.S. presidential inauguration on January 20th will start changes in how mining & processing companies supply critical minerals to different countries, including China and the U.S. Also, mining and royalty companies can comment on changes in demand in 2025 for critical minerals and precious metals. Separately, the U.S. Geological Survey included 50 critical minerals on its final list for 2022. The U.S. Department of Energy included 18 critical materials on its final list for 2023. We expect both of these lists to change in the next four years. This conference will be live on M-Vest. To attend, sign up to become an M-Vest member.

Global Holdings Launch \"ReElement Middle East\" to Advance Critical Minerals Processing in the Region ACCESS Newswire \u00b7 American Resources Corporation American Resources Corporation Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 4:00 PM 6 min read In This Article: AREC +5.39% FISHERS, IN and RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA / ACCESSWIRE / January 13, 2025 / American Resources Corporation (NASDAQ: AREC ) (\"American Resources\" or the \"Company\"), through its holding company, ReElement Technologies Corporation (\"ReElement\"), a leading provider of high-performance refining capacity of rare earth and critical battery elements, has partnered with LVC Global Holdings, a premier asset acquisition and advisory firm, to announce the formation of ReElement Middle East . The joint venture aims to revolutionize the processing of critical minerals and strategic metals in the Middle East and is strategically aligned with Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, which seeks to establish the country as a global hub for critical mineral resources while advancing regional economic diversification. ReElement Middle East will address the urgent need for localized and sustainable processing capabilities in a region that is critical to the global supply chain. The platform will leverage cutting-edge refining technologies and advanced capabilities to reduce reliance on foreign processing, enabling Saudi Arabia and its allies to strengthen supply chain security while meeting growing industrial and defense demands. Critical Minerals: A Cornerstone of National Security Critical minerals such as rare earth elements, lithium, germanium, gallium, nickel and cobalt are essential to technologies underpinning modern economies, including renewable energy systems, electric vehicles, semiconductors and advanced defense applications. According to a recent report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the global demand for critical minerals is expected to quadruple by 2040. However, over 75% of the world's processing capacity currently resides in China, creating vulnerabilities in global supply chains. ReElement Middle East aims to bridge this gap by establishing sustainable and secure processing solutions in the heart of the Middle East. Empowering Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 Aligned with Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, this joint venture supports the Kingdom's goal of becoming a net supplier of critical minerals to strategic partners, including the United States. The collaboration not only enhances Saudi Arabia's role as a global leader in the critical minerals space but also contributes to the region's economic diversification efforts and energy transition strategies. C. Derek Campbell, Executive Chairman of LVC Global Holdings emphasized the strategic importance of the venture, \"ReElement Middle East represents a monumental step in securing the supply of critical minerals while addressing the pressing need for sustainable processing solutions. By aligning with Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, we are not only fostering regional economic growth but also bolstering global security by creating a robust and resilient supply chain for our allies and partners.\" Story Continues Mark Jensen, Chairman and CEO of ReElement Technologies, emphasized the joint venture's innovative approach: \"Our partnership with LVC Global Holdings reinforces ReElement Technologies' mission to advance sustainable solutions for processing and refining critical minerals to battery, magnet and semiconductor grade. With ReElement Middle East, we bring our proven refining technologies to a region poised for transformation, ensuring a reliable and environmentally conscious supply chain for generations to come.\" A Proven Strategic Alliance ReElement Middle East builds on the success of the strategic alliance between ReElement Technologies and LVC Global Holdings, announced earlier this year. The two companies have already demonstrated a shared commitment to innovation and sustainability through collaborative projects in Africa. This new joint venture expands their impact, leveraging ReElement's cutting-edge refining technologies and LVC Global's deep regional expertise. The platform promises to deliver long-term value through sustainable and scalable solutions, uniquely positioned at the intersection of technology, resource security, and economic development.

Zacks Equity Research Tue, Jan 7, 2025, 4:57 PM 2 min read In This Article: CRS -0.99% MAG +0.89% American Resources Corporation's AREC subsidiary, American Infrastructure Corporation (\"AIC\"), has signed an agreement to merge with CGrowth Capital, Inc. (\u201cCGRA\u201d). The terms of the contract specify that American Infrastructure Corporation will become a fully owned subsidiary of CGrowth Capital, which will change its name to American Infrastructure Holding Corporation. The American Infrastructure team will assume the management of CGRA, and the existing operations and assets of CGRA will be spun out of that entity under this transaction, leaving the operations of American Infrastructure Corporation as the primary operation. The structure of the transaction is in the form of a tax-free exchange of American Infrastructure Corporation\u2019s shares for shares of CGrowth Capital. American Infrastructure\u2019s common shareholders will receive Series A preferred stock as consideration, which can be converted into common shares of the combined entity, American Infrastructure Holding Corporation, at the holder\u2019s discretion. The Series A preferred stock will automatically convert into common stock twelve months post merger. The merger marks a significant milestone for American Infrastructure, providing a pathway to support growth initiatives through organic and strategic acquisitions. American Infrastructure Corporation, being one of the last remaining metallurgical carbon growth platforms, has an asset base that is strong and believed to be among the lowest cost in the industry. The company will emphasize its royalty and leasehold production model strategy. AREC stock has plunged 51.3% in the past year compared with the 19.5% decline in the industry.

Merger with CGrowth Capital, Inc. ACCESS Newswire \u00b7 American Resources Corporation American Resources Corporation Mon, Jan 6, 2025, 4:00 PM 6 min read In This Article: CGRA -16.67% AREC +5.39% American Resources Corporation's (NASDAQ:AREC) (\"American Resources\" or the \"Company\") subsidiary American Infrastructure Corporation (\"AIC\"), a raw material supplier to the infrastructure marketplace with a focus on iron ore, titanium and metallurgical carbon, has entered into a binding term sheet to merge with CGrowth Capital, Inc. (OTC PINK:CGRA) (\"CGrowth Capital\" or \"CGRA\") as part of its spin out from American Resources Corporation. In conjunction with the merger with CGRA, the company has developed a structure to support future financing for both organic and acquisition growth within the infrastructure marketplace, aligning with its overall business strategy. Mark Jensen, Executive Chairman of American Infrastructure Corporation, commented, \"We believe this merger with CGrowth Capital represents a significant milestone for American Infrastructure and its shareholders, advancing our goal of achieving a senior exchange listing and providing a pathway for capital to support growth initiatives, both organic and through strategic acquisitions. As one of the last remaining metallurgical carbon growth platforms, we are confident in the strength of our asset base, which we believe is among the lowest cost in the industry. Over the next four years, we are well positioned to drive production and cash flow for our investors with relatively minimal capital expenditure required. We also believe this is an opportune time to be a pure-play infrastructure company, especially with the increasing focus on domestic infrastructure initiatives in the United States. Our strategy remains centered on leveraging our royalty and leasehold production model, which allows us to generate cash flow by partnering with experienced local operators who have a proven track record of success in the region. We are optimistic about the opportunities ahead in 2025 as we continue to grow the business. We also want to extend our gratitude to Nick Link and his team for their efforts establishing a strong platform like CGrowth Capital\". Under the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, American Infrastructure Corporation will become a wholly owned subsidiary of CGrowth Capital, Inc., which will change its name to American Infrastructure Holding Corporation. The American Infrastructure team will assume management of CGRA and nominate new board members, with Nick Link, the former Chief Executive Officer of CGRA, remaining on the board of the combined entity. The existing operations and assets of CGRA will be spun-out of that entity concurrent with this transaction, leaving the operations of American Infrastructure Corporation as the primary operations of the combined entity. Story Continues American Resources has received multiple LOI's for structured transactions over the last year ranging from $150 million to $280 million in total value to American Infrastructure. The structured nature of such previous transactions where not acceptable to the board. The merger with CGRA is structured to reflect the growth opportunities and achieve such value for the combined entity with additional growth capital to unlock additional value in the future. The transaction was structured as a tax-free exchange of American Infrastructure Corporation shares for shares of CGrowth Capital, Inc.. Common shareholders of American Infrastructure, as consideration for the merger, will receive a Series A Preferred Stock, which can be converted into common shares of the post-merger combined company, American Infrastructure Holding Corporation, at the holder's discretion. The Series A Preferred Stock will automatically convert into common stock twelve months after the merger. Additionally, the Series A Preferred Stock includes an anti-dilution provision, ensuring that any Series A Preferred shares not converted into common stock of the combined entity by the twelve-month anniversary of the merger will automatically convert into common stock of the combined entity, representing 92% ownership of the common stock outstanding in American Infrastructure Holding Corporation (formerly CGRA) at that time.

This Article: AREC +5.39% FISHERS, IN / ACCESSWIRE / January 8, 2025 / To our shareholders: 2024 marked a pivotal year of positioning and preparing our subsidiaries and business for growth and expansion as a leading players in the critical mineral supply chain. This strategic direction stemmed from the recommendations of our Board of Director's Special Committee, established in 2022 to identify ways to unlock shareholder value. Our mission is to build low-cost growth platforms by leveraging our core strengths: evaluating opportunities, strategically positioning them, and assembling the right team to execute effectively. With that process nearly complete, American Resources' primary mission moving forward is to further the build-out of our innovative technologies, solutions, and operations in both the upstream and downstream segments of our former subsidiaries' operations, with a large focus on leveraging the unique capabilities of ReElement Technologies Corporation to support suppliers and users of critical minerals. AREC will continue to invest in and build critical mineral feedstock opportunities while also evaluating downstream opportunities to invest in innovative solutions, such as our prior investment in Advanced Magnetic Lab, as an example. We believe our ability to identify low-cost opportunities, like mining waste feedstocks that the Company can capture and process into a concentrated feedstock to supply ReElement, represents a significant growth avenue. This partnership and strategy also have the potential to enable one of the largest domestic environmental cleanup initiatives ever to exist in the legacy fossil fuel and mining industries worldwide, leveraged through ReElement's ability to refine such feedstocks economically. For example, one of American Resources' investment focuses moving forward is the significant opportunity in unconventional rare earth and critical mineral supply sources, such as mining waste. This topic has gained substantial attention both politically and within the industry. These unconventional resources align well with ReElement Technologies' refining process and other companies capable of concentrating these feedstocks. With a vast number of mining waste sites within the United States alone, we believe these locations present a profitable and exciting investment opportunity. By leveraging byproduct economics for extraction, concentration, and purification of elements and minerals, this initiative represents one of the several verticals in American Resources. Moving forward, our primary focus will remain on investing in cutting-edge technologies and innovative operations, while also maintaining our investment holdings in the following assets, operations, and entities as outlined below. Story Continues ReElement Technologies Corporation Ownership Interest: Approximately 19.9% ReElement Technologies Corporation is revolutionizing the refining of critical and rare earth elements to ultra-high purity, with an initial focus on rare earth elements and key critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel. With 16 patents and technologies under its ownership or control, along with sponsored research partnerships with three leading U.S. universities, ReElement is driving innovation to meet increasing demand for magnet and battery metals. American Infrastructure Corporation (Acquired by CGrowth Capital, Inc. (CGRA) and soon changing its name to American Infrastructure Holding Corporation) Ownership Interest: approximately 9.9%: On December 30,2024, the Board of American Resources Corporation approved the acquisition of 100% of the common shares of American Infrastructure Corporation by CGrowth Capital, Inc. in exchange for Series A Preferred Stock in CGrowth Capital, Inc.
