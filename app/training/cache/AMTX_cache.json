(NasdaqGM: AMTX), a renewable natural gas and renewable fuels company, announced today that its Aemetis Biogas subsidiary commissioned three new dairy digesters in December 2024, increasing from nine to a total of twelve operating digesters. The additional digesters are expected to generate 250,000 MMBtu per year of renewable natural gas (RNG), contributing to a planned 550,000 MMBtu of RNG production in 2025. \"Our biogas business is creating significant revenue and income growth for Aemetis. The December expansion will increase RNG production capacity in the near-term by 80% and will contribute significantly to our business in 2025 and beyond,\" said Eric McAfee, Chairman and CEO of Aemetis. \"Revenue and income growth will also be enhanced when the Internal Revenue Service finalizes guidance for the Section 45Z Production Tax Credit that started on January 1, 2025, intended to incentivize domestic renewable fuel production. Looking ahead, in addition to the 50 dairies that have signed agreements with Aemetis Biogas, our geographic footprint in Central California allows us to expand our pool of feedstock for additional digesters and further expand RNG production capacity.\" In addition to the sale of Inflation Reduction Act Investment Tax Credits related to construction, expanded RNG production increases revenues and income in four ways: Sale of California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credits Sale of federal Renewable Fuel Standard D3 RINs Planned sale of federal IRA Section 45Z Production Tax Credits (45Z PTC) Sale of Renewable Natural Gas (RNG). Upon receiving LCFS pathway approval for the seven digesters currently in final review by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), the number of LCFS credits that the Company receives for the RNG production from those digesters will increase by about 80%. Pathway approval for these digesters is expected to occur in the first half of 2025. When fully operational, the dairies in the Aemetis Biogas Central Dairy Project are expected to produce more than 1.6 million MMBtu per year of RNG and generate annual revenues of $250 million.

Trump's tariffs Aemetis Provides Update on Federal Policies in the United States and Operations in India NewMediaWire Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 4:00 PM 6 min read In This Article: AMTX CUPERTINO, CA - January 23, 2025 ( NEWMEDIAWIRE ) - Aemetis, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMTX), a renewable natural gas and renewable fuels company, today provided an update on the impact of various federal policies in the United States and operations at the Aemetis biodiesel plant in India. On January 20, 2025, President Trump declared a \"National Energy Emergency\" via executive order that requires the EPA to consider the use of emergency fuel waivers to allow year-round sale of gasoline containing 15% ethanol, referred to as \"E15.\" Aemetis is the largest ethanol producer in California. An annual increase in demand for ethanol should bolster ethanol blending into gasoline and significantly reduce ethanol inventories nationwide. President Trump also issued the \"Unleashing American Energy\" executive order which directs all federal agencies to expand the development of domestic energy sources, specifically listing biofuels as a category of domestic energy to be supported by a wide range of federal efforts. The President, in a separate Executive Order, established a process for the review of pending policies and regulations before final adoption, including the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Tax Credit that applies to renewable natural gas (RNG) and ethanol production starting on January 1, 2025, under which the Office of Management & Budget will review and approve policies before implementation. The stated time frame for this policy review is 60 days, though actual policy adoption can be earlier or later. Aemetis plans to submit 45Z-related comments to the IRS for consideration during the expedited review process to confirm the calculation of 45Z tax credits as a part of the planned sales of Section 45Z tax credits generated by Aemetis Biogas and Aemetis ethanol operations. Aemetis has raised $50 million through USDA Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) loan guarantees and expects to close on its next $25 million REAP loan in the coming months, with additional applications already in the review process. Aemetis expects to construct 10 new dairy digester projects in 2025. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) notified Aemetis that seven dairy digester Provisional Pathway applications are \"deemed complete\" and were moved to the final verification process, which is expected to be completed this month. Aemetis expects CARB approval of these seven pathways by the end of Q1 2025. This CARB approval is expected to increase LCFS credits generated from these seven digesters by more than 80%, with the increased revenues and cash expected to be recognized in April 2025 and quarterly thereafter. CARB's November 2024 approval of the 20-year LCFS extension includes a shorter Tier 1 approval process for future Aemetis pathway applications, including the five dairy digesters commissioned by Aemetis Biogas in 2024, with an expected nine to twelve month approval period. Story Continues In India, the Kakinada biodiesel plant owned and operated by Aemetis' subsidiary Universal Biofuels Private Limited (UBPL) was contacted by local officials in mid-December 2024 regarding complaints by local residents of odors in the industrial area where the plant is located. Aemetis had produced about two months of biodiesel inventory and voluntarily agreed to halt production to investigate odors. However, after ceasing operations for one month, odors in the area persisted, likely related to edible oil fractionation facilities in the same area. On January 19, 2025, an official notice was received by UBPL requesting that the plant cease production until a review is completed, despite having already done so a month earlier. A resolution of the official order is being arranged with local officials. As the plant has two months of biodiesel product available for delivery to customers, the temporary cessation of production is not expected to impact the revenues under the current OMC allocation. Aemetis, through its UBPL subsidiary, built the Kakinada plant in 2008 and has operated the plant for more than 15 years, creating more than 100 direct jobs related to the plant and hundreds of jobs indirectly to support biodiesel plant operations. UBPL has extensive experience in dealing with local regulatory and government officials, and while it is not uncommon for officials to issue orders after the fact in response to local activists, production is expected to resume soon and expected deliveries under OMC allocations can be made from inventory on hand. Further, Aemetis has implemented an expansion of the Kakinada plant that increased annual production capacity from 60 million gallons per year to 80 million gallons per year. Universal Biofuels has identified a highly qualified candidate to be Chief Financial Officer and is working on a potential IPO of the business in India later this year. The local compliance notices are considered to be in the ordinary course of business for oil refineries, renewable fuels plants, and other processing plants in India and are not expected to have an impact on the IPO process. About Aemetis Headquartered in Cupertino, California, Aemetis is a renewable natural gas, renewable fuel and biochemicals company focused on the operation, acquisition, development, and commercialization of innovative technologies that replace petroleum-based products and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Founded in 2006, Aemetis is operating and actively expanding a California biogas digester network and pipeline system to convert dairy waste gas into Renewable Natural Gas. Aemetis owns and operates a 65 million gallon per year ethanol production facility in California's Central Valley near Modesto that supplies about 80 dairies with animal feed. Aemetis owns and operates an 80 million gallon per year production facility on the East Coast of India producing high quality distilled biodiesel and refined glycerin for customers in India and Europe. Aemetis acquired the 125-acre former Army Ammunition Production Plant site in Riverbank, California to develop a carbon sequestration project and a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel fuel biorefinery to utilize renewable hydrogen, hydroelectric power, and renewable oils to produce low carbon intensity renewable jet and diesel fuel.

tariffs Aemetis Biogas Receives $11 Million From Sale of IRA Investment Tax Credits NewMediaWire Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 4:00 PM 5 min read In This Article: AMTX Company Sells $13.5 Million of Tax Credits Generated by Renewable Natural Gas and Solar Project Investments CUPERTINO, CA - January 13, 2025 ( NEWMEDIAWIRE ) - Aemetis, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMTX), a renewable natural gas and renewable fuels company, announced today the receipt of $11 million, after transaction costs, from the sale of $13.5 million of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) investment tax credits generated by a solar electricity generation project at the Keyes ethanol plant and two dairy biogas digesters built as Aemetis Biogas projects. Aemetis has also entered into an agreement to sell the tax credits generated by the additional three dairy digesters that Aemetis commissioned in December 2024. The IRA was signed into law in August 2022 and provides transferable federal income tax credits for investments in renewable energy projects, as well as production tax credits for low carbon intensity renewable fuels. Aemetis generated IRA Section 48 investment tax credits from its investment in a 1.9 megawatt solar photovoltaic and battery microgrid built at the Keyes ethanol plant and from two dairy biogas digesters constructed and placed in service by Aemetis during 2024. \"The $11 million of net proceeds received by Aemetis achieves the goals of the Inflation Reduction Act by attracting domestic investment and job creation while reducing dependence on imported crude oil by encouraging the conversion of waste into renewable fuels,\" stated Eric McAfee, Chairman and CEO of Aemetis. \"Aemetis expects to generate more than $500 million of IRA investment and production tax credits to support our biogas projects, carbon intensity reduction at our ethanol plant, and the construction and operation of our CO2 sequestration wells and other projects.\" The Aemetis Keyes ethanol plant supplies about two million pounds of animal feed daily to feed more than 100,000 dairy cows at about 80 dairies in the local area. To capture methane at dairies and produce renewable natural gas (RNG), Aemetis has completed and is operating twelve dairy digesters, 36 miles of biogas pipeline, a central biogas to RNG production facility, and a PG&E utility gas pipeline interconnection. Aemetis plans to produce 550,000 MMBtu of RNG in year 2025. Approximately 25% of methane emissions in California are emitted by dairy waste lagoons that do not have methane capture systems such as those installed by Aemetis. When fully built, the Aemetis Biogas project plans to capture methane from the waste produced by more than 150,000 cows at dairy farms in California and produce 1,650,000 MMBtu of renewable natural gas from captured dairy methane each year. When fully operational, the Aemetis Biogas project will reduce greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to an estimated 6.8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide over ten years. Story Continues About Aemetis Headquartered in Cupertino, California, Aemetis is a renewable natural gas, renewable fuel and biochemicals company focused on the operation, acquisition, development and commercialization of innovative technologies that replace petroleum-based products and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Founded in 2006, Aemetis is operating and actively expanding a California biogas digester network and pipeline system to convert dairy waste gas into Renewable Natural Gas. Aemetis owns and operates a 65 million gallon per year ethanol production facility in California's Central Valley near Modesto that supplies about 80 dairies with animal feed. Aemetis owns and operates an 80 million gallon per year production facility on the East Coast of India producing high quality distilled biodiesel and refined glycerin for customers in India and Europe. Aemetis acquired the 125-acre former Army Ammunition Production Plant site in Riverbank, California to develop a carbon sequestration project and a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel fuel biorefinery to utilize renewable hydrogen, hydroelectric power, and renewable oils to produce low carbon intensity renewable jet and diesel fuel.

Trump's tariffs Those who invested in Aemetis (NASDAQ:AMTX) five years ago are up 192% editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Thu, Dec 26, 2024, 1:12 PM 3 min read In This Article: AMTX It certainly might concern Aemetis, Inc. ( NASDAQ:AMTX ) shareholders to see the share price down 33% in just 30 days. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been very strong. Indeed, the share price is up an impressive 192% in that time. So while it's never fun to see a share price fall, it's important to look at a longer time horizon. The more important question is whether the stock is too cheap or too expensive today. While the long term returns are impressive, we do have some sympathy for those who bought more recently, given the 52% drop, in the last year. Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. See our latest analysis for Aemetis Aemetis isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally hope to see good revenue growth. As you can imagine, fast revenue growth, when maintained, often leads to fast profit growth. For the last half decade, Aemetis can boast revenue growth at a rate of 6.8% per year. That's a fairly respectable growth rate. We'd argue this growth has been reflected in the share price which has climbed at a rate of 24% per year over in that time. It's well worth monitoring the growth trend in revenue, because if growth accelerates, that might signal an opportunity. Accelerating growth can be a sign of an inflection point - and could indicate profits lie ahead. Worth watching 100% The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). NasdaqGM:AMTX Earnings and Revenue Growth December 26th 2024 You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic . A Different Perspective Aemetis shareholders are down 52% for the year, but the market itself is up 26%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 24% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Aemetis better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 4 warning signs with Aemetis (at least 2 which are significant) , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

Aemetis (AMTX) Reports Q3 Loss, Tops Revenue Estimates Zacks Equity Research Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 5:50 PM 3 min read In This Article: AMTX Aemetis (AMTX) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.38 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.47. This compares to loss of $0.59 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 19.15%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this renewable fuels and specialty chemicals company would post a loss of $0.58 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.66, delivering a surprise of -13.79%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once. Aemetis , which belongs to the Zacks Biofuels industry, posted revenues of $81.44 million for the quarter ended September 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.70%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $68.69 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Aemetis shares have lost about 31.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 25.8%. What's Next for Aemetis? While Aemetis has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Aemetis: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

(AMTX) Is One of the Best Ethanol Stocks to Invest in Now? Mashaid Ahmed Sun, Dec 22, 2024, 5:59 PM 6 min read In This Article: AMTX We recently published a list of 11 Best Ethanol Stocks To Invest In Now . In this article, we are going to look at where Aemetis, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMTX ) stands against other best ethanol stocks to invest in now. Ethanol, also known as ethyl alcohol, is a renewable fuel that can be naturally produced through the fermentation of sugars by yeasts, or it can be man-made through petrochemical processes. Ethanol can be utilized for various applications, but it is majorly used in the US as a gasoline additive in the transportation sector to enhance fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. According to the latest data released by the US Energy Information Administration on December 18, US fuel ethanol production saw a significant increase of more than 2% during the week ending December 13. At the same time, fuel ethanol stocks experienced a slight decline, while exports surged by nearly 33%. A Catalyst for the Ethanol Industry The E15 fuel blend, which contains 15% ethanol was restricted due to concerns about increased smog pollution in hot weather. However, earlier in 2024, the E15 fuel blend was temporarily approved in 49 states for the summer and the US government allowed the year-round E15 sales by 2025 only in certain Midwestern states. These regulatory changes boosted the ethanol industry margins as retailers sought to offer lower-cost fuel to consumers. On December 17, a US government funding bill included a provision allowing year-round sales of gasoline with a higher ethanol blend, specifically E15. This inclusion represents a significant victory for the corn and ethanol industries, which have long advocated for the expansion of E15 sales to boost demand for their products. The plan also provides credits to some refiners for compliance with the US Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a mandate requiring refiners to blend billions of gallons of biofuels into the nation\u2019s fuel supply or purchase credits from those that do. The biofuels industry has welcomed this provision, with Geoff Cooper, President of the Renewable Fuels Association, expressing hope that the funding bill would be swiftly enacted. CoBank Report: U.S. Ethanol Production to Remain Steady According to a report by CoBank, published on December 12, the US ethanol production in 2025 is expected to remain largely unchanged from 2024 levels, with the industry facing significant political and regulatory uncertainties. The report highlights that while the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts that ethanol production will average about 1.05 million barrels per day in 2025, the sector is navigating several challenges, including policy uncertainty surrounding the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program, small refinery exemptions (SREs), and the potential impact of tariffs. Story Continues The report notes that the incoming Trump administration is likely to take a cautious approach to proposing new RFS renewable volume obligations (RVOs) for 2026-2029, preferring to wait for actions on pending SREs. During the previous Trump administration, 34 SREs were granted for the 2017 RFS compliance year, whereas the Biden administration has not approved any SREs and has denied 79 SRE petitions to date. This contrast in policy approaches adds to the regulatory uncertainty facing the industry. Despite these challenges, the report identifies some positive trends, particularly in the area of global demand for ethanol. CoBank emphasizes that expanding renewable blending requirements in countries around the world are contributing to a growing global demand for ethanol. US ethanol exports are projected to set a new volume record in 2024, with Canada emerging as the top destination. However, the potential for trade policy changes, including the imposition of tariffs on world trading partners and retaliatory tariffs on US agricultural products, including ethanol and distillers\u2019 dried grains (DDGs), could limit export growth. Additionally, the expansion of corn ethanol production in Brazil may increase competition in the global market, further impacting US ethanol exports. With the ethanol industry facing a mix of regulatory changes, global demand shifts, and political uncertainties, the sector is poised for significant developments in the coming years. However, the potential for increased global demand offers promising opportunities for growth. Why Aemetis, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMTX) Is One of The Best Ethanol Stocks To Invest In Now?

Tue, Dec 17, 2024, 4:00 PM 5 min read In This Article: AMTX Aemetis, Inc. Renewable Natural Gas Production Expected to Increase by 80% to 550,000 MMBtu of RNG per Year, Generating PTCs Under the Inflation Reduction Act Starting January 1, 2025 CUPERTINO, Calif., Dec. 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aemetis, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMTX), a renewable natural gas and renewable fuels company focused on low and negative carbon intensity products, announced today that its operating ethanol and renewable natural gas (RNG) facilities have received approval from the Internal Revenue Service for Excise Tax Registration for Section 45Z Production Tax Credits (PTCs) under the federal Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The Aemetis Advanced Fuels Keyes, Inc. and Aemetis Biogas production entities are registered as producers of clean transportation fuel. The Section 45Z Production Tax Credit provides a transferrable federal income tax credit for producing fuels with greenhouse gas profiles, referred to as \u201ccarbon intensity,\u201d lower than petroleum-based fuels and specified statutory thresholds. Registration information was required to be filed before July 15, 2024, to be assured of registration prior to January 1, 2025, when the 45Z Production Tax Credit is scheduled to commence under the IRA, and Aemetis timely completed the required registration process. \"The 45Z Production Tax Credit creates incentives for the domestic production of renewable, low carbon fuels, replacing the blenders tax credit that supports both imported and domestic fuels,\" said Eric McAfee, Chairman and CEO of Aemetis. \u201cThe 45Z PTC directly encourages the production of lower carbon intensity renewable fuels by providing a scaled tax credit that increases with lower carbon intensity fuels, at the rate of $1.00 per gallon or gallon equivalent for every 50 carbon intensity points reduction below positive 50 carbon intensity. The Aemetis Biogas projects are well positioned to generate significant tax credit revenues from an estimated negative 380 carbon intensity for dairy RNG under the GREET model, which would equate to a tax credit of $8.50 per gallon equivalent under Section 45Z.\" Under the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) passed in 2007, one million British Thermal Units (MMBtu) of RNG contains the equivalent of 11.7 gallons of energy, thereby generating D3 Renewable Identification Numbers at the rate of 11.7 D3 RINs for every one MMBtu. The number of gallon equivalents of 11.7 under the RFS multiplied times an $8.50 tax credit per gallon provides the expected revenues per MMBtu that will be generated by dairy RNG. Aemetis Biogas is expanding operations, currently with ten digesters operating and two more nearing final completion for a total of twelve digesters processing waste from sixteen dairies. Combined, these digesters are designed to produce an estimated 550,000 MMBtu per year of RNG in 2025, approximately an 80% increase from Aemetis\u2019 current production capacity of 300,000 MMBtu per year. Story Continues Aemetis has experience in the sale of tax credits, including the sale of $63 million of investment tax credits under the IRA in September 2023, generating $55 million of cash proceeds after sale discount, insurance, accounting and legal costs related to the sale. The buildout of the dairy digesters and other facilities in the Aemetis Biogas project has been funded by $50 million of USDA guaranteed loans with 20-year repayment terms under the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP). An additional $75 million of USDA guaranteed loans are currently in process. When fully operational, the dairies in the Aemetis Biogas Central Dairy Project are expected to produce more than 1.6 million MMBtu per year of RNG and generate annual revenues of $250 million.

on Trump's tariffs Analyst Estimates: Here's What Brokers Think Of Aemetis, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMTX) After Its Third-Quarter Report editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Fri, Nov 15, 2024, 2:05 PM 3 min read In This Article: AMTX Aemetis, Inc. ( NASDAQ:AMTX ) just released its third-quarter report and things are looking bullish. Results overall were credible, with revenues arriving 4.4% better than analyst forecasts at US$81m. Higher revenues also resulted in lower statutory losses, which were US$0.38 per share, some 4.4% smaller than the analysts expected. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year. View our latest analysis for Aemetis NasdaqGM:AMTX Earnings and Revenue Growth November 15th 2024 Taking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Aemetis' six analysts is for revenues of US$466.8m in 2025. This would reflect a substantial 60% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. The loss per share is expected to greatly reduce in the near future, narrowing 65% to US$0.68. Before this latest report, the consensus had been expecting revenues of US$467.1m and US$0.62 per share in losses. Overall it looks as though the analysts were a bit mixed on the latest consensus updates. Although revenue forecasts held steady, the consensus also made a moderate increase in its losses per share forecasts. As a result, there was no major change to the consensus price target of US$12.15, with the analysts implicitly confirming that the business looks to be performing in line with expectations, despite higher forecast losses. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. The most optimistic Aemetis analyst has a price target of US$28.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$3.00. So we wouldn't be assigning too much credibility to analyst price targets in this case, because there are clearly some widely different views on what kind of performance this business can generate. As a result it might not be a great idea to make decisions based on the consensus price target, which is after all just an average of this wide range of estimates. Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry . The analysts are definitely expecting Aemetis' growth to accelerate, with the forecast 46% annualised growth to the end of 2025 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 6.8% per annum over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 3.1% annually. It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect Aemetis to grow faster than the wider industry. Story Continues The Bottom Line The most important thing to take away is that the analysts increased their loss per share estimates for next year. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates. With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Aemetis. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits.

Commissioning and Construction Aemetis, Inc. Tue, Dec 10, 2024, 4:00 PM 5 min read In This Article: AMTX Aemetis, Inc. Renewable Natural Gas Production Capacity Expected to Increase by 80% to 550,000 MMBtu of RNG per Year From Twelve Digesters Processing Waste From Sixteen Dairies CUPERTINO, CA, Dec. 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aemetis, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMTX), a renewable natural gas and renewable fuels company focused on low and negative carbon intensity products, announced today that its Aemetis Biogas subsidiary started producing renewable natural gas (RNG) from its tenth anaerobic digester built to process waste from a dairy in Stanislaus County, California.\u00a0 The newly constructed digesters for five additional dairies are in final stages of commissioning and construction, which is scheduled to expand the total Aemetis Biogas operations to twelve digesters processing waste from sixteen dairies.\u00a0 Combined, the digesters are designed to produce an estimated 550,000 MMBtu per year of RNG in year 2025, an 80% increase from the current production capacity of 300,000 MMBtu per year. This month, Aemetis also expects to generate an estimated $11.5 million from the sale of investment tax credits from the construction of dairy digesters and other projects earlier this year. The new digester completed today and the additional digesters under construction are expected to generate additional investment tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act currently estimated at approximately $10 million of additional proceeds from tax credits to be sold during Q1 2025. Separately, seven of the company\u2019s existing operating dairy digesters are now in the final verification process for California Air Resources Board (CARB) pathway approval under the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS).\u00a0 The temporary pathway for dairy biogas under the LCFS is -150 carbon intensity.\u00a0 Aemetis expects the approved pathways will average -380 carbon intensity, resulting in approximately a 100% increase in LCFS credit revenues from the generation of additional LCFS credits.\u00a0 LCFS Pathway approval from CARB is expected in the first half of 2025.\u00a0 In the recent adoption by CARB of air emissions mandates through year 2045, Aemetis RNG production is expected to qualify for 20 years of avoided methane credits under the Low Carbon Fuel Standard in California. \u201cAemetis Biogas is on track to increase RNG production by about 80%, including the dairy digester that began operation today and those projects nearing completion,\u201d stated Eric McAfee, Chairman and CEO of Aemetis. \u201cWe are pleased with the rapid acceleration of revenue growth from new digesters, which generate revenues from LCFS credits and Renewable Fuel Standard D3 RINs.\u201d Story Continues Aemetis digesters are connected to an existing 36-mile Aemetis biogas pipeline, feeding the central RNG production facility located at the Aemetis Keyes ethanol plant near Modesto. To date, 49 dairies have signed agreements with Aemetis Biogas to supply waste to existing and planned dairy digesters in the Aemetis Biogas Central Dairy Project. The buildout of the dairy digesters and other facilities in the Aemetis Biogas project has been funded by $50 million of USDA guaranteed loans with 20-year repayment terms under the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP).\u00a0 An additional $75 million of USDA guaranteed loans are currently in process. Prior to the additional dairy digester started today, Aemetis generated biogas from nine anaerobic digesters fed by ten dairies with a production capacity of approximately 300,000 MMBtu per year of RNG. After upcoming completion of three new digesters processing waste from six additional dairies, Aemetis expects to produce approximately 550,000 MMBtu of RNG per year from 12 digesters processing waste from 16 dairies. When fully operational, the dairies in the Aemetis Biogas Central Dairy Project are expected to produce more than 1.6 million MMBtu per year of RNG and generate annual revenues of $250 million.
