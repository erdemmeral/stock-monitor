Wire Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 5:00 PM 4 min read In This Article: GCI -1.77% Digital marketing growth platform provides conversational AI and AI-powered lead management NEW YORK, NY, January 27, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- LocaliQ , Gannett Co., Inc. \u2019s (NYSE: GCI) Digital Marketing Solutions (DMS) business, has launched Dash by LocaliQ , an Artificial Intelligence (AI) lead management SaaS solution to harness lead conversion. With its comprehensive suite of features, AI agents, advanced automation capabilities and AI-powered reporting, Dash is at the forefront of marketing technology \u2013 paving the way for businesses to achieve unprecedented growth through optimized lead management. The capabilities Dash provides are the latest in the tools available through LocaliQ\u2019s proprietary AI marketing platform created to drive efficiency, eliminate manual tasks, and enhance customer experiences. This next-generation software solution ensures businesses can free up their calendar, grow their business faster and boost conversions. With features including advanced reporting and lead management tools to summarize, categorize and prioritize incoming leads, the solution enables business operators to better manage their time spent converting prospects to customers. All incoming leads are processed by AI and saved to an activity dashboard that monitors customer interactions. AI generates valuable insights that prioritizes leads, ranking the order in which prospects should be followed up. Dash by LocaliQ replaces what was previously a timely and manual process. Business owners utilizing lead scoring and management spend less time listening to call recordings and going through their inbox, allowing them to follow up faster and win more business. \"Introducing Dash to the marketplace underscores LocaliQ\u2019s commitment to technological advancement and positions us as a leader in the digital marketing space,\" said Chris Cho, President, LocaliQ. \"Dash by LocaliQ is the connective tissue to our suite of services, designed to help our subscribers convert leads faster. This is the future of lead management technology, and we will continue to leverage the power of AI to help businesses thrive with the release of additional conversational AI offerings later in the year.\" Earlier this month, Dash introduced an AI SMS agent, representing a significant leap forward in the capability of the product with the addition of conversational AI. Dash SMS Agent simulates human conversation, providing LocaliQ subscribers the ability to instantly respond to incoming SMS messages and qualify leads through natural interactions. A recent study of LocaliQ customer data shows that 40% of SMS leads go unanswered because businesses do not have the time to reply to all of them immediately. Leveraging natural language processing, machine learning, and foundation models to create conversations the SMS agent can accurately and efficiently answer business-specific questions. The Dash SMS agent helps small business owners automate the work of converting customers and growing revenue, giving time back to focus on their day-to-day operations. Story Continues LocaliQ was recently recognized as a winner of the 2025 BIG Innovation Award. The award recognized the product development and market introduction of Dash\u2019s outstanding contributions to innovation.

Usman Kabir Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 7:42 PM 4 min read In This Article: LBRDK -0.77% We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire George Soros' Long-Term Stock Picks . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) stands against George Soros' long-term stock picks. George Soros is one of the most influential figures in finance, philanthropy, and global affairs. As the founder of Soros Fund Management and the Open Society Foundations, Soros has achieved monumental success as a hedge fund manager while using his wealth to champion democratic values, human rights, and social causes worldwide. Soros was born in Hungary during World War II, and his family survived Nazi occupation by securing false identities and hiding from persecution. In 1947, Soros fled Hungary and moved to England, where he studied at the London School of Economics. After graduating in 1952, Soros worked in various merchant banks before moving to the United States.

Soros began his career in finance in New York City, where he gained experience in arbitrage and securities trading. In 1970, he founded Soros Fund Management, which later became the Quantum Fund, one of the most successful hedge funds in history. Between 1970 and 2000, the Quantum Fund generated an average annual return of over 30%, making it one of the best-performing funds in history. In 1992, Soros became famous as the man who broke the Bank of England. He bet against the British pound, anticipating that it would be devalued due to economic pressures. His position netted him a profit of $1 billion in a single day, cementing his status as a legendary investor. As of the end of the third quarter of 2024, his net worth is estimated at $7.2 billion. The 13F portfolio of his hedge fund is worth more than $6.9 billion.

Story Continues A technician in a telecom facility installing wireless routers and operating on a computer. Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ: LBRDA ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25 Soros Fund Management's Stake: $86.6 million Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) is a communications services firm. This company emerges as a prime investment opportunity for several reasons. First and foremost, as per the reports for the third quarter of 2024, the financial overview from the recent filing indicates a positive trajectory, with revenue increasing from $240 million in the third quarter of 2023 to $262 million in the third quarter of 2024, showing positive growth overall.

Overall LBRDA ranks 2nd on our list of George Soros' long-term stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of LBRDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Demand for advanced stoves, durable tents, and smart connectivity drives an evolving camping equipment market, spotlighting lightweight solutions and fostering breakthroughs in modular, eco-friendly product development worldwide. New Delhi, Jan. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global camping equipment market valuation is poised to reach US$ 87.71 billion by 2033, with a CAGR of 7.7% during forecast period 2025-2033. The global appetite for camping gear continues to surge as enthusiasts embrace experiences in mountain, forest, and coastal settings. This demand extends beyond seasoned adventurers and increasingly includes families, solo travelers, and hobbyists seeking quick outdoor getaways. Many campers place a high value on lightweight products and durable construction, prompting established names like Quechua, Coleman, and Black Diamond to develop offerings that suit various terrains. In 2024, data from the American Camp Association confirmed that exactly 1,157 accredited organizations in the United States now regularly purchase bulk orders of tents and sleeping pads to accommodate the rising influx of recreational campers. Meanwhile, the Japanese Alpine Club reports holding 21,600 active memberships this year, reflecting Japan\u2019s growing dedication to high-altitude excursions that necessitate specialized equipment. An additional benchmark can be seen with the Canadian Outdoor Council, which recognizes that six local gear manufacturers, including Woods and Chinook, have recently expanded production lines for portable cooking sets. The European Outdoor Group also noted a record-breaking 650 exhibitors at its latest industry showcase in Friedrichshafen, with interest leaning toward multi-purpose shelters that support both backcountry and family-oriented campsites. Download Free Sample Pages @ https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/camping-equipment-market The widening consumer base has encouraged large retailers in the camping equipment market to diversify their catalogs, ensuring backpackers, glampers, and climbers find suitable solutions. The market\u2019s annual headcount of camping participants is often reflected in the membership rosters of hiking clubs worldwide; the Austrian Alpine Association now lists over 160,000 active affiliates who frequently utilize sturdy sleeping bags and robust cooking stoves. Four countries\u2014namely the United States, Canada, Germany, and Australia\u2014stand out for consistently high purchasing volumes linked to both casual recreation and specialized trekking. Industry sources also track key application areas such as off-grid mountaineering, rock climbing combined with overnight stays, and forest camping with family-sized tents. Many major players tailor offerings for these niches: Coleman is famous for quick-assembly dome tents, Quechua remains a top pick for modular, weather-resistant canopies, while Black Diamond sustains demand with premium climbing gear. Brands across the board are focused on meeting a consumer appetite that prioritizes compactness, reliable durability, and easy room for customization.

In Camping Equipment Market Decathlon and Newell Brands Inc. lead the roster of top global entities driving the camping equipment market through comprehensive product lines and extensive market reach. Decathlon is headquartered in Lille, France, and boasts hundreds of stores worldwide, including prominent locations in India, China, Spain, and Brazil. The company\u2019s in-house labels such as Quechua provide a broad range of tents, backpacks, hydration solutions, and sleeping bags designed for varied climates. Newell Brands Inc., meanwhile, commands significant recognition via Coleman, its outdoor-specialized subsidiary known for foldable stoves, lanterns, coolers, and portable chairs that cater to both new and experienced campers. A respected trade publication recorded that Decathlon has a total of 125 dedicated camping sections across its stores in Asia alone, each offering region-specific kits for novice wanderers and mid-level trekkers. A separate consumer survey compiled in 2024 placed Coleman among the top three brands most trusted by American families for backyard and car camping adventures. Revenue streams linked to these two powerhouses in the camping equipment market span multiple continents. Decathlon leverages strong digital platforms and in-person outlets, ensuring that items like its Forclaz trekking gear reach customers across youth travel programs and long-distance hikers alike. Coleman\u2019s presence is equally entrenched within major retailers in North America, Europe, and select markets in Southeast Asia, contributing to an expansive consumer base. Both brands strive to fulfill demands for durable, weather-proof equipment while maintaining user-friendly features. Recent audit figures indicate that Decathlon saw a notable uptick in sales of insulated hiking backpacks in specialized European alpine shops. Another research group confirms that Coleman\u2019s battery-powered lantern collection is now stocked by more than 2,000 independent stores worldwide, a point underscoring how deeply the brand has penetrated local markets. Rapid Acceleration of Climbing Equipment In Camping Activities Worldwide, Set to Grow at CAGR of 10.5% Climbing gear has become an exceptionally dynamic category in the camping equipment market, showing a new resonance amid global adventure seekers. Enthusiasts from diverse backgrounds are melding vertical pursuits with overnight stays in mountainous regions to create a more immersive experience. Specialty shops in Colorado, California, and parts of Bavaria have reported that harnesses and rope sets are some of the most requested add-ons when customers plan multi-day alpine excursions. In 2024, an outdoor gear forum compiled direct listings for more than 90 distinct climbing shoe models recommended for both indoor facility use and rock faces, illustrating a surge in product variety. The organizers of a major mountaineering event in Chamonix have tracked applicant participation from nearly 50 countries, highlighting a thriving international focus on conquering challenging ascents. Safety considerations drive much of this attention; verified labs confirm extensive testing of load-bearing carabiners to certify them for repeated use. A key driver behind this wave in the camping equipment market is the interplay between social media inspiration, the emergence of climbing documentaries, and the growing network of climbing-specific clubs. Major national parks in the United States note that thousands of backcountry permits incorporate multi-pitch itineraries, prompting campers to pack specialized harnesses and belay devices. The link between climbing and camping fosters a consumer mindset that values reliable brand reputations, thoughtful design, and gear rigorously tested under tough conditions. At least six gear developers, including Petzl and Black Diamond, are frequently praised by expedition leaders who document product performance on high-altitude expeditions. The popularity of integrated hiking-and-climbing journeys lays the groundwork for further growth since many first-time climbers are keen on purchasing their own set of protective equipment instead of borrowing or renting. Factors like dependable rope friction, comfortable harness padding, and slip-resistant footwear consistently rank among the top priorities influencing buying decisions. Personal Ownership Of Climbing Equipment Rises Faster Than Commercial Demand, Set to Grow at CAGR of 8.1% Personal ownership of climbing gear is rapidly outpacing commercial use in the camping equipment market, reflecting a preference for individualized control, hygiene, and specialized exploration. Urban dwellers venturing to nearby crags or bouldering sites find it more convenient to invest in their own rope sets, harnesses, and chalk bags, avoiding the scheduling constraints that come with instructor-led sessions. Several large retailers reported in 2024 that over half of their climbing-related inquiries came from beginners eager to purchase adjustable gear. Another independent study conducted in Switzerland uncovered a jump in the number of private climbing clubs formed by colleagues and friends, all pooling resources to visit alpine routes on weekends. This cultural shift underscores a desire for self-directed adventure that does not rely on commercial facilities. Many novices see personal equipment as a path to skill-building on their own terms. Global associations that host climbing workshops for new entrants have noted an uptick in participants bringing their own harnesses and friction devices, while brand loyalty frequently emerges once climbers discover designs that properly fit their body type. Retailers in the camping equipment market carry a wide array of personal protective gear in multiple sizes, with waist belts and leg loops tailored to accommodate different body proportions. Outdoor guides point out that frequent exercise and repeated ascents encourage individuals to customize their setups, exploring advanced gear from companies such as Mammut and Edelrid. This enthusiasm for personal ownership accounts for the fastest-growing segment in climbing equipment, overshadowing the shared model often seen at commercial gyms. There is a sense of pride in belonging to an informal community of adventurers who tailor each outing according to their skill level, schedule, and chosen terrain.

Weekend adventurers in nations such as China, Japan, India, and South Korea increasingly integrate short treks into their schedules, propelling the popularity of both car-accessible campsites and self-guided wilderness expeditions. Market watchers in Hong Kong have observed that at least four new specialty stores opened in 2024, each catering exclusively to family-sized tents and foldable camp furniture. Local tourism boards in Japan also promote insect-proof sleeping setups, as certain national parks encounter seasonal bugs that can affect nighttime comfort. Additional evidence of the region\u2019s eagerness to adopt robust gear emerges through official Himalayan trekking organizations, which report that mountaineers from multiple provinces now secure advanced oxygen-compatible tents for their cold-weather expeditions. Several factors contribute to this momentum in the camping equipment market. In India, large sporting outlets from Decathlon to Wildcraft are making campsite necessities more visible in dedicated aisles that highlight multi-purpose lanterns and compact cooking solutions. China\u2019s southwestern provinces host scenic reserves where visitors benefit from daypack-and-tent combos specifically tested for challenging weather. Regional experts confirm that the Japanese youth demographic is taking up an unprecedented number of group excursions to lesser-known trails, boosting demands for lightweight canopies. Distributors rely on a blend of e-commerce platforms and brick-and-mortar channels to reach dispersed consumers, ensuring that even relatively remote areas have access to equipment from recognized labels. Leading providers like Montbell, Naturehike, and KingCamp foster brand loyalty by offering warranties on outer-shell materials and specialized gear for varied climates.

Dylan Lewis: We're checking in on the Big Macro and the state of real estate. This week's Motley Fool Money Radio Show starts now. It's the Motley Fool Money Radio Show. I'm Dylan Lewis. Joining me over the Airwaves Motley Fool Senior Analyst Jason Moser and Ron Gross. Fools, as always. Great to have you here. Ron Gross: Hey, Dylan. Dylan Lewis: I'm doing great. We're putting a bow on the holiday shopping season. We're going to be checking in on what to expect from the real estate market in 2025. Of course, you guys are bringing your stocks on your radar later on in the show. But first up our first look at the Big Macro for 2025. This week we got the minutes from the Fed's latest meeting in December, adding a little bit of fuel to Fed Watch 2025. Ron, what is the outlook right now? Story Continues Ron Gross: It's a little dicey, Dylan. [laughs] I think what the weak stock market has been telling us lately is that we still actually may have an inflation problem after all of the soft landing talk. Friday's job report appears to perhaps confirm that. I think on Friday, quite frankly, the market was also reacting to the ongoing wildfire tragedies in California with both human and economic impacts being considered, and certainly, our hearts go out to all involved there it really is a tragedy. I'm going to circle back to Friday's job report in a minute, but let me just provide some general context first. Earlier in the week, investors digested the minutes from the Fed's December meeting where officials basically said that the pace of interest rate cuts would slow this year as a result of what we see as lingering inflation and also the impact of some of Trump's trade and immigration policies, which we don't really know how they're going to play out yet and what impacts they're going to have. That scenario has all but done away with the hope that the Fed will cut interest rates again before the middle of the year. Of course, the markets do not like that 10-year treasuries jumped to 4.7% highest since April and we have a risk that the economy is actually growing too quickly, and the markets don't like that. Now, on Friday, back to the Jobs report, the market was hoping for a week jobs report to say things are finally calming down. We got the opposite with 256,000 jobs created, much more than expected with unemployment ticking down to 4.1%, wages grew slightly less than expected, so bad for workers, but somewhat good for the inflation story, and the 10-year treasury yield jumped again to 4.77%. That's the highest since 2023. The markets are shaky right now. Inflation seems to be persisting, job market is strong, and interest rates don't look like they're coming down from the Fed anytime soon. Dylan Lewis: Ron, it sounds like you are pausing that appointment for the soft landing tattoo that you had been planning all of 2024. Ron Gross: I remain optimistic about the economy. I think we're going to be just fine. Dylan Lewis: Jason, Ron just gave us a great rundown, anything that you want to zoom into there? Jason Moser: Well, you can be forgiven if you're new to the investing world, and you would think that a good jobs report would bode well for strong results and a positive outlook. Everybody's glass half full, and lo and behold, we get this market sell-off. Ron really, I think, hit the nail on the head there. This is about interest rates. It's about inflation. You would think a report like this would be cheered because it portends economic growth, growing corporate profits. But, this one comes back to what are they going to do about interest rates. We're in this twilight zone regarding interest rates right now. As Ron mentioned with the Fed, it seems like they are all on board with feeling like inflation hasn't quite fully been defeated yet, so time will tell but this is a volatile time. Dylan Lewis: The Fed minutes, not the only information from December that we're catching up on. We've also got the final tally for online retail activity for the holidays from our friends over at Adobe . The sticker figure, 241 billion in online holiday spend between November 1st and December 31st, up about 8% over 2023. Jason, did you do your part to help push the numbers higher this year? Jason Moser: Well, we definitely did our part. It was a great holiday season, I hope everyone had a wonderful holiday season. Again, pointing to that strong economic growth thing, there were a lot of positive takeaways from this report. Like you mentioned there in regard to total online retail spend, up 8.7% from a year ago. That's strong, considering we've been talking a lot about the state of the consumer lately. I think very encouraging. We saw mobile gain share representing a 54.5% of total spend coming from mobile devices. We gave it a hard time in the early days, but buy now pay later is establishing itself as another tool for consumers to use. BNPL had another good year, it represented just over $18 billion of total spend versus $16.6 billion a year ago. Now, a point made in the report that will be worth following as earning season starts to roll out here, there was stronger-than-expected discounting. While we always pay attention to margins in these retail numbers, I think that will be even more the case here this coming earning season. We'll pay very close attention to what those margins look like. Ron Gross: Whenever we talk about a strong consumer, the first thing that comes to my mind is, let's keep an eye on credit card debt, and let's keep an eye on savings balances, perhaps being drawn down, because that will have repercussions down the road. I don't know where we'll shake at on that yet, but they always go hand in hand to me. I'm happy to see strong numbers, but let's see how consumers funded those expenditures. Dylan Lewis: Looking through Adobe's report, one of the things that jumped out to me was they identify some of the hottest segments on some of the biggest shopping days. Looking at Black Friday, in particular, this year makeup and the skin care category was an incredibly hot seller. Jason, I'm guessing that bodes well for a company like Ulta . Jason Moser: It does. We've talked about it a lot with Ulta, it's a long time rec in the Foolish universe, and it's partly because that cosmetics and makeup market opportunity that's just such a resilient one, even through difficult times, it still does OK. We saw Ulta this week make a couple of announcements. They have a new CEO. Dave Kimbell has stepped down and the former COO of the company, Kecia Steelman is taking his place. She's been with the company for about 10 years now. She was the COO since June 2021. She seems like a very natural fit to take that role. Then along with that announcement, they also announced that they raised their guidance for the holiday quarter just a little bit, stronger numbers based on stronger traffic and stronger spending, and that ties back with what you were just mentioning there in the report. Dylan Lewis: We'll see how all that winds up flowing through to retail earnings over the next couple weeks and months. But if you are hungry for earnings results, don't worry. Delta is here to get the party started this earning season. Ron, this was what looked like an incredibly strong report. The market reacted incredibly positively to it. Shares up 10% today. Ron Gross: On a very weak Friday, that's hard to do but the report backs that up. They reported their best ever annual revenue, and CEO Ad Bastian sees the momentum carrying into 2025. He added, we're seeing growth in the corporate space, double digit growth in corporate bookings. We're seeing the international area showing very healthy growth. That portends well for the next year or so. Revenue growth up 5.7% on acceleration in demand. That was versus guidance of only 2-4%, so a nice beat there. They have a diversified revenue base, as many airlines do now, led by premium and loyalty. That was 57% of revenue in 2024, so that's been moving up nicely. All three international geographies improved sequentially and relative to expectations, so that's strong, corporate sales at 10%. You have really on the revenue side, things look quite strong. Now on the margin side, cost control is perhaps even better, operating margins widened to 12% from 9.7% and they generated pre tax income of 1.6 billion up 500 million from last year. They raise guidance, they see four billion dollars or more of free cash flow in 2025. Their investment grade debt, all three credit regencies now have them as investment grade, so they've been really focusing on the balance sheet. Things look like they're going pretty well for Delta, only trading nine times forward earnings. Not necessarily expensive, that is where airlines trade, but I certainly wouldn't call the stock expensive here. Dylan Lewis: Ron, Delta is on the early side when it comes to reporting earnings and quarterly results. They are one of the better providers in the airline industry right now. Based on what you're seeing, how do you think it portends for some of the others that will report over the next couple of weeks? Ron Gross: United was up on Friday in response. I think people are looking for good numbers from them as well. Southwest has really been struggling. Southwest a 20 times earnings because those earnings are so depressed right now versus somewhere like 7-9 for the rest of the industry. Let's keep an eye on Southwest and see if they can turn the corner. Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break, Amazon's got its eyes on Alphabet 's Cash Cow. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. Here on air with Jason Moser and Ron Gross. We're going to spend a little time surveying the advertising landscape today because we have a few stories that are getting at some of the different shifting dynamics there. I want to kick us off with Disney, the House of Mouse giving its first look at total ad supported users this week. Across Disney plus, Hulu and ESPN plus, 157 million users globally have opted for their ad supported tiers. Jason, meet the new boss, same as the old boss, advertising. Jason Moser: It all has come full circle, hasn't it? Dylan, we're basically back to where we started decades plus ago with just watching TV with commercials. Granted, it's a little bit more user friendly with Internet TV, obviously, and things that are more on demand. But what we've seen here through and through is that advertising continues to rule the day and these companies, Disney and others, they've just done a very good job of creating value. They're saying, listen, if you don't want to pay for an ad free subscription, well, we've got this tier for you that's going to have some ads in it it's going to be a cheaper tier. Honestly, they they want to push more of those ad subscriptions because over the longer haul, they can be more lucrative. This made me think immediately of Netflix, with those numbers that Disney reported. Netflix ad supported tier, that now reaches 70 million users around the globe. That's versus 40 million they reported in May, and I think like 22 million at the beginning of the year. It's not just Disney that's witnessed a lot of this fantastic growth. Netflix and others are feeling the same. Dylan Lewis: It's interesting to hear you mention the upside there because if we rewind to Disney's last earnings call, management noted that the average revenue per user for their Disney plus subscribers actually went down. That was because a lot of people were opting for this ad supported plan, and those were a little bit less lucrative for them right now. Ron, when you look at this, we have seen plenty of times where businesses have had to pivot a little bit, and it's done some weird things to some of their core metrics. Is this one of those things that you're saying, we're willing to stomach what might be some bumpiness in a core metric here, because we think the long term opportunity is better for Disney's monetization? Ron Gross: I think you nailed it, that's basically the strategy. We're seeing some streaming fatigue, I think the numbers bear that out. Consumers in general just have too many streaming services, and they're too expensive. They're looking to offload some of them, they're looking to pay less for others. Streamers have to adapt to that. We're seeing Disney do that. As far as the stock goes, don't sleep on the stock. Only 20 times forward earnings for a company like Disney, which granted, has struggled really since the pandemic to get its act together. But as far as maybe a value investment, dare I say, Disney looks interesting to me. Dylan Lewis: I was going to say, Disney largely unmoved this week by this news, I think it was actually down about 2%. I don't know if that's because the market is not all that interested in Disney's streaming ambitions or because they also announced that they were buying Fubo TV this week, then announced that they were not going to be launching venue sports with some of the partners for that joint venture. Do we feel like we need a little bit of strategic direction on the streaming side from Disney, Ron? Ron Gross: Communication is key. Let's get some good strategic communication. I think they've got some strategies there, but we just need a clear guidance on them. Dylan Lewis: Sticking with the ad theme. This week, Amazon announced its retail ad service product, which will allow retailers in the US to show ads on their sites. Users will be able to customize the design, also the placement and ads that are shown and use some of the ad measuring tools and analytics that Amazon makes available. Jason, summarizing that, it sounds an awful lot like what Google offers to web publishers for ad tools. Jason Moser: Well, this is the Goglification of Amazon. They are becoming a little bit more of what companies like Google historically have been. That's because they recognize the opportunity there in the advertising space. It's not just streaming, it's just advertising in general. I think that this is something that can provide Amazon with a bit of a 1, 2 punch, so to speak, the ad space, because not only do they make money from selling the ad space, but it's going to provide as you mentioned, it's going to provide Amazon with valuable data that it's going to be able to use to bolster ad predictions and recommendation technology, which makes its retail business, which is the core of the business ultimately even stronger. Just a lot of different ways that Amazon can win from this. It wasn't that long ago we were just looking at advertising as an afterthought with Amazon. Ad revenue in the latest quarter came in just over $14 billion, but it's third to Alphabet and Meta. It's become a major player in this space in a short amount of time, it feels like. Ron Gross: Yet that's their third best revenue stream. It's 61 billion for the online stores, 27 billion for the Cloud computing, only in quotes, 14 billion for the ad revenue business. This could be a nice bump there, something that I think people were wondering when this would happen, and here we are so that third division now could start to creep up on maybe even the Cloud business in a year or two. Jason Moser: I think a lot of investors probably have looked at Amazon over the last couple of years or so and said, this is a business that's extracted so much value from its retail operations and its Amazon web services. Is this a stock that's really worth owning today, given how large the company is? It's a fair question, but when you look under the hood a little bit, and you see the opportunities that still exist there, not only on retail, not only on Amazon web services, but obviously now in advertising, and how all three of those businesses can complement one another so powerfully. As an Amazon shareholder myself, I have zero intentions on unloading that stock anytime soon. Dylan Lewis: I'm with you on all the strategic vision here. I think for me, it's nice because to me, it shows that they are getting levers outside of just bringing more ads onto the core Amazon e-commerce experience, which I think as a user, as a buyer, as a shopper, I have noticed the search results have gotten deprecated a little bit recently. [laughs] Ron Gross: It's not a great experience some days, searching for whatever you're searching for. But it's still worth my prime membership year after year after year. Dylan Lewis: That quick shipping, it's going to get you. Rounding us out on advertising news. In an address this week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook and Instagram will stop its use of fact checkers and will replace them with crowd-sourced community notes, similar to how moderation is currently handled on X. Zuckerberg, essentially saying the guidelines were meant to create platforms that were more inclusive and they have gotten complicated and overly restrictive, preventing free speech, filtering out activity that maybe shouldn't be suppressed. Jason, is this a user friendly move? Is this an advertiser friendly move? Is it both? Is it neither? Jason Moser: I think it's something that ultimately can serve all parties well. I like to believe he's making this decision because of what he said and the fact that there's some proof of concept out there that the community notes way of things can actually work quite well. If you look at X as just an example, formerly Twitter, I know that's a platform that elicits strong opinions, and that's understandable. But they've clearly proven that the community notes is a promising way of managing information that flows through the platform, it is more transparent, it points to actual source material with the facts. It's a heck of a lot cheaper. Then that it's sourced from the community itself. The odds are that they want this to be a thriving community of accurate information to begin with. There are a lot of opportunities to capitalize on there. It's not to say it's a perfect way, but it certainly has been a very effective way in my experience as a user. I'll be interested to see what his feedback is over time on this. Ron Gross: I have been a long term owner of Meta Facebook, and I don't think I'm selling any time soon. Twenty-five times earnings seems fair to me for this business. There's a lot of things going on here, though, that I need to digest, and I need to shake see how it shakes out. I think the business is fine, but there's a lot of potential backlash that could come from this, which is a risk that I think investors have to keep in mind. Dylan Lewis: We know the X side when it comes to users. We don't know what it means in terms of financials. We don't get access to what's going on quarterly over at X. We'll see what happens. All right, Jason, Ron, we'll see you guys a little bit later in the show. Up next, we're going to get the download on the State of Real Estate 2025 with BiggerPockets' Dave Meyer. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. We love talking stocks here at the Motley Fool, but we know there are plenty of places that you can put cash to work, including real estate. When we want to talk about buildings and homes, we turn over to our friends at BiggerPockets. This week, my colleague Matt Argersinger caught up with Dave Meyer, he's the head of real estate investing over there. Matt and Dave talk through Dave's annual look at the state of the real estate market report and why the hottest markets might not be the areas with huge population increases in 2025. Matt Argersinger: Dave, in the report, you describe the state of real estate investing as transitionary. I'd love to know what you mean by that, and maybe the better way to put it is what is the real estate market transitioning from, and maybe what is it transitioning to? David Meyer: I believe that real estate works in cycles similar to other markets. They may not be as obvious as stock market cycles or broader economic cycles. But you do still see the traditional phases of a business cycle in real estate where there's an expansion, there's a peak, there's \"recession\" or a reversal. There's a trout and then it starts growing again. I actually believe we are coming to in 2025. I don't know if it's today as of a recording or five or six months from now, but I think we're coming to the end of the last \"real estate recession\". We can talk about what's characterized that, but I do think we're entering a new expansion era for single family real estate. Particularly in terms of sales volume and inventory. That is a real key thing here, because when I say that the real estate market's been in somewhat of a recession, it's because no one's buying houses right now. We've seen the number of transactions drop 50% since 2022. Although prices are probably, in my opinion, going to remain somewhat flat for the next year, I do think we're going to start to see some health restored in the real estate market in terms of more transactions happening, more homes being listed for sale, more people moving a little bit, and unlocking some of the just the gridlock, frankly, that we've been in in this industry for two or three years now. Matt Argersinger: You mentioned the home transactions, and one of the charts you have in the report is shows existing home sales. It's amazing to see that right now we are at the lowest annualized volume of sales since the global financial crisis since right after the last major recession we had. What is the chief culprit of the sluggishness, in your view? David Meyer: You'll probably get bored of me saying this in our conversation. But for me, almost everything in the housing market right now comes down to affordability or the lack thereof. Affordability in the housing market is just a measure of how easily the average American can afford the average priced home. That's made up of home prices, people's wages, and mortgage rates. Just in the last three years, we've seen affordability evaporate as prices continue to go up and mortgage rates have skyrocketed as pretty much everyone knows. Now this lack of affordability has dual impacts on the market. The obvious one is a reduction of demand. I think that one makes sense to most people that, hey, things are getting more expensive. I don't want to or not that you even don't want to buy a home, but you can't afford to buy a home anymore. The other thing that's happened, though, is that low affordability, it's unique to the housing market, reduces supply as well. That's because in the housing market, nearly 80% of people who sell a home go on to buy one. When you have these rough buying conditions like we have today, it stops people from selling, as well. We can go back to Econ 101 and draw our little supply and demand charts. But when you see supply go down and demand go down at the same time, volume or quantity in the marketplace declines, and it's just a textbook example of that going on. Matt Argersinger: You mentioned the mortgage rate skyrocketing, which is just interesting because we know we've been on a fed easing cycle since the fall. Yes and we still think we're on one. We're not exactly sure as we get. David Meyer: We'll see. Matt Argersinger: But can we have a recovery in existing home sales? Can this market get unstuck if mortgage rates remain where they are, which is close to 7% right now? David Meyer: I think it's going to be very slow. That is my hypothesis for the cycle changing right now is that even if rates come down, I do think it's still going to be slow either way. In real estate, we see behavior, especially for sellers driven by two things. One is opportunity, if there's good opportunities to buy, people trade up or even trade down or move to different places, look for new opportunities. That's one thing. The second thing is just necessity. People change jobs or you need to move for your kids school or there's death, or there's divorce. Those things don't really go away. That basically sets the floor for volume in the housing market. The hypothesis and we're starting to see this bear out in the data is that even with higher interest rates, people have been able to defer some of those life changes for a little while. But eventually, people get used to mortgage rates. They need to move. They want to be closer to family. They want to be in a different school district, and they just start getting used to it, and we're starting to see that. Inventory has likely bottomed. It's starting to increase right now, and we're starting to see transaction volume just tick up a little bit. That's even despite, as you said, mortgage rates have gone up since the Fed started cutting rates, and so if the Fed cuts rates even more, if mortgage rates start to come down for some of the external reasons outside of the Fed, I think that will just add a little bit of fuel to the recovery. Matt Argersinger: If you are a real estate investor, so people, obviously, life changes have to happen. But if you're looking at it from an investing lens, should I wait for rates to come down? We don't know the Fed's going to do, but it seems like they've telegraphed hopefully at least two more cuts this year. Not certain, of course, but should I wait, then, for that to take place and for that to translate into lower mortgage rates or what's the advice there? David Meyer: That is the million dollar question, and my advice is not to wait. I'm not waiting. It's January 9th today. I've already made my first offer on a property this year. I'm waiting to hear about it today, so we'll hear. But here's two reasons why. First is, I am much less optimistic than I think most people are about mortgage rates coming down this year. I agree the Fed probably will cut rates one or two more times, but as we've seen, the federal funds rate and mortgage rates are correlated but not perfectly correlated. Mortgage rates are much more closely tied to the yield on 10 year treasuries. That's almost a perfect correlation. If you look at the two charts, they just move basically in lockstep. What we've seen since the run up to the election when the market started to feel like Trump was going to win, and since Trump's victory, there is now a bigger fear it seems, in the bond mark, you probably know this of inflation than there was of recession. That switch in market sentiment from fear of recession to fear of inflation drives yields up and has kept mortgage rates up. I think they're going to stay up until we get a better line of sight on which economic policies Trump has campaigned on that he actually will implement and what the shape of those policies actually start to look like, because if you start implementing 20% tariffs, which he's said across the board, that's probably going to be inflationary and keep yields up really high. If he cuts taxes, that could provide a huge boost to the economy, but it also could be inflationary. I believe that we'll get some clarity about that, but not really and that's not going to be the first week of his term. I think it's going to take a little while for the market to feel comfortable about the direction of economic policy. Until then yields are probably going to stay a bit higher, and so will mortgage rates. I don't advise waiting because you might be waiting for a long time. The second reason is that home prices are expected to grow this year. I said that they would be flat. That's in real terms. I think in nominal non inflation adjusted terms, they probably will go up a little bit. Buying sooner, you first start to pay down your mortgage, which allows you to pail principle and equity. Second, you get the upside potential of any appreciation and real estate has historically been a very good hedge against inflation. If you're fearful of inflation, then real estate could be a good avenue for you to park money to at least keep pace with inflation in terms of home prices, and then you enjoy a lot of other benefits as a real estate investor beyond just home values. Matt Argersinger: Let's stay on the price and value a little bit. One of the things that was also interesting from the report is where you're actually seeing year over year price increases. Recently, I think it's flown in the face of what a lot of people expected, which is, it's really happening on the coastal and your legacy markets. You're in California, you're Northeast, you're Midwest and we know in the years before the pandemic and the immediate years after the pandemic, a lot of that demand was going to more Sunbelt states, Texas, Arizona, Gulf states. That's shifted, even though that's where we know the demographic tailwinds are. Why do you think this shift is happening? Is it simply there was too much demand, and so therefore, too much construction, too much building in places like Austin, Texas, and now we have a supply overhang. David Meyer: I think the majority of it, is that a lot of the markets in the Sunbelt, some of them in the Mountain West have become victims of their own success in a way. Back in 2020, 2021, we saw this huge migration shift and demographic shift to the South in general, the Sunbelt. That drives up home prices, and developers love that. They all started building both single family homes and particularly multifamily apartment buildings. With multifamily, it takes a few years for those things to be built and so they're getting permitted and funded through 2022, and they're still coming online right now. We actually you can see it. It's pretty striking if you look at the data. The number of deliveries, which is just an industry term for how many units are finished and put on the market for lease or for sale, it's at a 50 year high right now, and then it's going to last through the first half of 2025, and then it's basically going to stop. The pendulum has swung back in the other direction. I do think this year will be a rough year in terms of pricing for Texas and Florida. By rough, I don't mean, like, we're not talking financial crisis declines or two or 3%. It's not going to be a great year for them. Whereas these markets that have been more it's a tortoise and the hare thing, slow and steady Midwest markets, New York markets. They didn't see this huge boom in construction, but there's still demand in those places, and that's why prices have gone up there. I expect Midwest and New York, Northeast, those prices to moderate a little bit this year. They've been up pretty high, but I still think they'll continue to grow, particularly in nominal terms. Matt Argersinger: Well, I think let's leave it at this. Besides, of course, reading the report, besides joining BiggerPockets, which our listeners should absolutely do, what is best advice that you can give an investor who is looking to get more active in physical real estate in 2025. You mentioned a few things, but is there anything you can leave maybe our listeners, someone who's saying, hey, I think this might be the year I want to buy my first rental property or maybe my first multifamily property duplex or something like that. What's your advice? David Meyer: Real estate is a long game. I know at Motley, you guys often talk a lot about long term investing, and real estate is the same thing. I personally buy deals for ten years from now for 15 years from now. I try and find good assets in good neighborhoods that are probably going to keep growing. We're in a weird economic time. Everyone knows this. No one knows for certain what's going to happen in the next year or two. I really recommend people look beyond that because just like in the stock market, if prices go down a little bit, if they're a little flat in the next year or two, it's just a paper loss. In real estate, you're still getting the benefits of amortization. You get cash flow, you get amazing tax benefits. I think a lot of people just get hung up on property values. It's super important don't get me wrong, but you can still earn a 6, 7, 8% return, even if property values are flat in real estate. Just go Google, the median home price in the US, if you look at it over the time, home prices do go up in the United States. They are going to keep going up. As long as you had this long term mindset, I think finding deals is not as hard as it's made out to be right now. Matt Argersinger: Well, Dave Meyer, BiggerPockets.

Coming up after a quick break, Jason Moser and Ron Gross return with a couple of stocks on their radar this week. Stay right here. They're listening to Motley Fool Money.

Motley Fool only picks products it would personally recommend to friends like you. I'm Dylan Lewis, joined again by Jason Moser and Ron Gross. We're diving right in to radar stocks this week. Guys, each week you bring a stock. Each week, our man behind the glass Rick Engdahl hits you with a question. Jason, you're up first this week. What are you looking at? Jason Moser: Dylan, so this week, I'm looking at Paylocity Ticker's PCTY. Next Wednesday, we have an exciting AI event that will be available for all US premium members. Part of my presentation is on Paylocity. I've digging a little bit more in this company for that event. Paylocity is a provider of cloud based human capital management and payroll software solutions here in the US. They offer products and services like payroll and tax services, human capital management, including things for, like, employee self service. Management solutions for recruiting and onboarding. They benefit from actually participating at the lower end of the market, smaller businesses that may not have access to those types of products or at least alternatives can be tough to find or more expensive. This is a business that's also leaning into our AI driven future with things like AI driven schedule optimization, which helps meet the needs of employees. AI led learning recommendations to aid employee development and career paths, as well as AI powered recommendations built on generative AI to increase overall employee engagement. It's an interesting business. Cash flow positive, even after stock based compensation. It's profitable. Net margin continues to grow hitting better than 15% over the last 12 months. I tell you, it's a compelling business. I'm enjoying digging into it. Dylan Lewis: Rick, a question about Paylocity Ticker, PCTY. Ron Gross: Well I like to go to the website and learn a little bit about the company. I'm looking at the Paylocity difference here, which is our all in one solution combined with award winning service, makes us the best partner to help your business. Now, that doesn't sound a lot like a difference to me, so I'm wondering does this company have a mote? Jason Moser: Well, I think it's a very competitive industry, to say the least, so I don't know about a mote, but I do like the fact, like I mentioned, they participate on that low run of the market where businesses are looking for more cost effective solutions. It's worth noting, too, the founder and director, Steve Serowiz still owns about 16% of the company. Clearly, he sees good days ahead, as well. Dylan Lewis: Ron Jason is gazing to the future riding the AI wave with his radar stock this week. Where are you going? Ron Gross: Backwards. I'm taking a first look at Gannett thanks to my friends over at our Value Hunter Service, ticker symbol GCI. It's so new to me that I don't know if it's called Gannett or Gannett. I think Gannett. A media company. Most people would know it as the owner of USA today, but they also own hundreds of regional properties like the Arizona Republic, Cincinnati Inquirer, Detroit Free Press, and many more generate revenue primarily through the sale of subscriptions and advertising. Now, the rub here is that it's widely believed that the legacy newspaper business is dying, and I think that's probably correct. Their revenue, for example, fell from 2.2 billion in 2020 to 1.3 billion in 2023 as readers and advertisers shifted online. But the good news is they are shifting as well. They're turning themselves more into a content business. Think things like games and puzzles, high school and college sports coverage, full time reporters hired to cover fan favorites like Beyonce and Taylor Swift, much more content generated, much less not like the legacy newspaper business. That's actually a higher margin business and so it looks like it could be an interesting company, a real value investment here from our friends over at Value Hunters. Dylan Lewis: Ron, we know you're a Swifty. We knew Gannett was going to work its way in there. Rick, a question about Gannett Ticker GCI. Rick Engdahl: My friend David Gardner taught me to invest in the world that I want to see in the future. Is it a better world when all of these local newspapers are owned by a company like Gannett? Is that part of the problem? Is that part of why the press is dying is that they've all been consolidated like this? Ron Gross: Well, the Internet is probably the primary problems. Rick Engdahl: The primary problem, but not the only problem. Jason Moser: I love the idea of small town newspapers, as Warren Buffett has said in the past, as well, but it's just a tough business in this environment. Dylan Lewis: Rick, which one's going on your watch list this week? Rick Engdahl: I want to be paid, so I'm going to go pay Lawson. Dylan Lewis: I love it.

Satellite Services Business Wire Wed, Jan 8, 2025, 8:00 PM 3 min read MCLEAN, Va., January 08, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Intelsat, operator of one of the world\u2019s largest integrated satellite and terrestrial networks, signed an expanded satellite services agreement with GCI, Alaska\u2019s largest telecommunications company, that will soon deliver multi-orbit broadband services throughout the largest state in the U.S. \"Four years ago, Intelsat and GCI entered into an agreement that dramatically increased the size and speed of GCI\u2019s geostationary satellite network in rural Alaska and cemented GCI as the state\u2019s leader in satellite connectivity,\" said Mike DeMarco, Chief Commercial Officer. \"This new chapter of our partnership expands our agreement to include next-generation low-earth orbit satellite services and leverages the best of what Intelsat has to offer.\" GCI has delivered satellite-based connectivity for 35 years and has the largest footprint of satellite-delivered data, video and voice services in Alaska. The new deal with Intelsat ensures GCI will be able to meet the growing demands of customers including regional tribal health care providers, school districts, government agencies, and businesses. The agreement not only provides GCI continued access to reliable C-, Ku-, and Ka-band GEO service, which is already part of GCI's satellite service portfolio, it also provides access to high-throughput LEO service managed by Intelsat. \"For over a decade, GCI and Intelsat have been working together to meet the evolving needs of GCI\u2019s satellite customers and to bring the best technology to the table,\" said GCI Senior VP of Corporate Development Billy Wailand. \"Our expanded agreement will give GCI access to Intelsat\u2019s broad portfolio of proven, high availability GEO services, next-generation LEO service, and deep expertise in managed satellite services.\" Delivering service in Alaska requires a comprehensive approach and a willingness to use \"every tool in the toolkit.\" For GCI, that toolkit includes fiber, microwave, as well as GEO and LEO satellite services. GCI will rely on wholesale satellite capacity as well as Intelsat\u2019s fully managed solutions. Those managed services allow GCI to quickly bring their own solutions to market without the need to invest in additional satellite ground infrastructure to provide quality connectivity for end customers. About Intelsat Intelsat\u2019s global team of professionals is focused on providing seamless and secure, satellite-based communications to government, NGO and commercial customers through the company\u2019s next-generation worldwide network and managed services. Bridging the digital divide by operating one of the world\u2019s largest and most advanced satellite fleet and connectivity infrastructures, Intelsat enables people and their tools to speak over oceans, see across continents and listen through the skies to communicate, cooperate and coexist. Since its founding six decades ago, the company has been synonymous with satellite-industry \"firsts\" in service to its customers and the planet. Leaning on a legacy of innovation and focusing on addressing a new generation of challenges Intelsat team members now have their sights on the \"next firsts\" in space as they disrupt the field and lead in the digital transformation of the industry.

This year\u2019s CEI includes 1,449 businesses \u2013 the highest number of rated companies since the start of the CEI in 2002. \"We are deeply honored to be recognized by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation for the seventh year in a row,\" said Michael Reed, Gannett Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"At Gannett, fostering an inclusive and diverse culture is paramount, and this distinction highlights our steadfast dedication.\" \"We are proud to have achieved a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s Corporate Equality Index and pleased to be recognized for our dedication to creating a supportive and inclusive workplace that celebrates the diverse backgrounds of our colleagues,\" said Samantha Howland, Gannett\u2019s Chief People Officer.

to enhance mutual cultural learning PR Newswire Tue, Jan 7, 2025, 5:47 AM 6 min read BEIJING , Jan. 6, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- \" China will work with all countries to promote friendship and cooperation, enhance mutual learning among different cultures, and build a community with a shared future for mankind. We must jointly create a better future for the world.\" Chinese President\u00a0Xi Jinping's 2025 New Year message has sparked enthusiastic responses. As the great changes unseen in a century further evolve, China will continue to inject momentum and bring confidence to a world in turmoil and transformation. The Global Times launches a series of articles themed \" China's commitments in the new era\" to help our audiences gain a deep understanding of the significance of China's commitments to contemporary responsibilities. In his 2025 New Year message, Chinese President Xi Jinping stated that China will work with all countries to enhance mutual learning among different cultures. This declaration highlights the importance of mutual learning among civilizations while reflecting China's sense of responsibility. It not only envisions a harmonious future that upholds the diversity of civilizations but also showcases China's dynamic strength in keeping pace with the times. The concept of a community with a shared future for mankind is founded on a five-point comprehensive framework: an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world of lasting peace, universal security and shared prosperity. It embodies humanity's aspirations and dreams for a better world. A world of lasting peace seeks partnerships in which countries treat each other as equals, engage in extensive consultation, and enhance mutual understanding. A world of universal security fosters a security environment featuring fairness, justice, joint efforts and shared interests. A world of shared prosperity envisions an open, innovative and inclusive development that benefits all. A clean and beautiful world builds an ecosystem that puts Mother Nature and green development first. Finally, an open and inclusive world aims to promote harmony, inclusiveness and respect for differences. \"Delicious soup is made by combining different ingredients.\" The diversity and differences among human civilizations are fundamental characteristics of the world and the source of human progress. Variations in ideologies, social systems and development models should not become barriers to the exchange of civilizations, let alone reasons for confrontation. In the face of global changes unseen in a century, the necessity of further promoting mutual learning between civilizations has become increasingly evident. Story Continues First, mutual learning among civilizations helps maintain world peace. Indeed, the theme of our time - peace and development - has not changed, but many factors still hinder peace and development globally, and the \"peace deficit\" persists. Therefore, maintaining world peace and promoting global development remain humanity's enduring aspirations. The course of history has repeatedly shown that without mutual learning among civilizations, distances and divisions will emerge between nations and peoples, making peaceful coexistence more difficult and increasing the risks of conflict and war. Second, mutual learning among civilizations helps promote globalization. Globalization is an inevitable path for human society, an objective requirement of growing social productive forces, and a natural outcome of advancement in science and technology. However, alongside the advancement of globalization, anti-globalization sentiments sometimes stir trouble, largely due to the irreconcilable differences in the interests of nations rooted in different civilizations. Therefore, to bridge the differences in the interests of various countries to the greatest extent, it is essential to uphold the principles of equality, mutual learning, dialogue and inclusiveness among civilizations and to further promote mutual learning among civilizations. Third, mutual learning among civilizations helps promote the self-improvement and progress of human civilization. The world is home to a diverse range of civilizations, each with its unique charm and profound heritage, making them spiritual treasures of humanity. On one hand, diversity is a fundamental characteristic of the world and a source of the appeal of human civilization. On the other hand, every civilization embodies the spiritual essence of different nations and has made significant contributions to the development of human civilization. Therefore, different civilizations can only complement and enrich each other through mutual exchange, further advancing the continuous progress of human civilization. Fourth, mutual learning among civilizations helps uphold and promote the shared values of all humanity. Peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom are universal values. However, individuals living in different civilizations have varying understandings of these values. To promote them effectively, it is essential to advocate for communication and mutual learning among cultures, respect the diverse interpretations of value concepts by various civilizations, and approach the values of all civilizations with an open and inclusive mindset. We must embrace the diverse foundations of other civilizations' values with a broad perspective, discarding any sense of superiority and avoiding the notion of civilizational supremacy, while seeking common ground and respecting differences. Promoting mutual learning among civilizations requires a steadfast commitment to appreciating the beauty of all civilizations and striving to enrich the forms of cultural exchange. It also involves working to overcome language barriers and vigorously promoting people-to-people diplomacy. China has been proactive in this regard, making significant contributions to advancing mutual learning among civilizations in the process of building a community with a shared future for humanity. First, the Global Civilization Initiative (GCI) was proposed. At the Communist Party of China (CPC) in Dialogue with World Political Parties High-Level Meeting held in March 2023 , Xi put forward the GCI as a timely response to the urgent call for people of all countries to strengthen unity and cooperation in addressing common challenges. It is also an active response to the universal desire of nations around the world to uphold equality, inclusiveness and the diversity of world civilizations. Furthermore, it aligns consciously with the international community's shared need to enhance dialogue and exchanges among civilizations, promote cultural prosperity and development, and respond sincerely to the current trend of advancing the development of civilizations while jointly building a community with a shared future for mankind. Second, a new form of human civilization has been created. Under the strong leadership of the CPC, the Chinese people have developed a new form of civilization through the coordinated development of material, political, spiritual, social and ecological civilizations. Third, promoting the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) through people-to-people ties. People-to-people ties are the social foundations of BRI cooperation. As BRI partner countries use hundreds of different languages and have diverse historical roots and cultural backgrounds, it is essential for all countries to uphold the principles of equality, mutual learning, dialogue and inclusiveness among civilizations and to carry forward the spirit of friendly cooperation along the Silk Road. They should also engage in a wide range of cultural exchange activities that contribute to this cause. To promote people-to-people ties, China has developed practical action plans that integrate this goal with strong policy coordination, facilities connectivity, unimpeded trade and financial integration, thus effectively advancing mutual learning among civilizations. In summary, diversity spurs interaction among civilizations, which in turn promotes mutual learning and their further development. In the great practice of building a community with a shared future for mankind, China , with its unique cultural charm and open, inclusive attitude, has built a bridge for the mutual learning and integration of world civilizations. China is truly focused on its aim of enhancing mutual learning among different cultures. The author Jiang Shixue is a distinguished professor at Shanghai University.

Alaska's new U.S. representative, names former business partner to staff Iris Samuels, Anchorage Daily News, Alaska Sun, Jan 5, 2025, 7:59 AM 4 min read Jan. 4\u2014Alaska's newly elected Republican U.S. Rep. Nick Begich III cast his first vote on Friday, supporting Louisiana Republican Rep. Mike Johnson for House speaker on the first day of the 119th Congress. Begich took the oath of office after Johnson was reelected speaker Friday afternoon. A businessman whose personal wealth helped propel his ascent to Congress, this will be Begich's first time representing the state in elected office. In a statement, Begich said he would work on \"unleashing Alaska's vast natural resources, building infrastructure that fosters growth, and championing policies that put Alaskans and Americans First.\" In assuming office, Begich becomes only the sixth U.S. House member representing Alaska since it was granted statehood. He is the grandson of Nick Begich Sr., a Democrat who served as Alaska's third U.S. House member before a plane he was in disappeared on a flight from Anchorage to Juneau in 1972. He is also the nephew of Alaska's Democratic former U.S. Sen. Mark Begich. Begich announced staffing choices Friday, including selecting his former business partner as a senior adviser. JC Garrett will join Begich's congressional staff after working as chief executive of FarShore Partners, a software company started by Begich, and as managing partner of Dashfire, an equity investment firm started by Begich. Begich's chief of staff will be Michael Horanburg, who previously served as chief of staff for a one-term Republican U.S. House member from New Mexico. His legislative director will be Kevin Swanson, who previously worked for U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski and former U.S. Rep. Don Young, who died in office in 2022. Josh Walton, who ran Begich's recent campaign and previously worked for the Alaska GOP, was named legislative assistant. For state director, managing in-state operations, Begich has named Rick Whitbeck, who previously worked for an organization championing resource development and prior to that worked for GCI, Alaska's largest telecommunications company. To manage his Anchorage office, Begich picked Portia Babcock Samuels, who previously worked for oil company ConocoPhillips. She is the sister of Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy's former chief of staff, Tuckerman Babcock. Managing the Fairbanks office will be Leslie Hajdukovich, who recently lost a high-profile race for Alaska Senate. Hajdukovich previously worked for Republican U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan. Nick Begich III, 47, was born in Alaska and raised by his maternal grandparents in Florida, returning to the state as an adult with a conservative brand of politics that set him apart from his grandfather and uncles, who held elected office as Democrats. Story Continues Begich's path to Congress began in 2020, when he co-chaired the reelection campaign of Young, Alaska's longtime U.S. House member. In 2022, Begich announced he would run against Young, positioning himself to the right of Young, who died unexpectedly several months after Begich entered the race. Several of Young's former staffers supported his Democratic opponent, Mary Peltola, helping propel her to victory. Begich again ran against Peltola in 2024, prevailing in what was one of the most expensive U.S. House races that year. Begich beat Peltola by less than three percentage points. Begich was endorsed by Trump and Johnson, the U.S. House speaker, only after Alaska Republicans pressured Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom \u2014 Trump and Johnson's favored candidate \u2014 to drop out of the race after finishing behind Begich in the August primary. Peltola, who formally ended her time in Congress on Friday, has yet to comment publicly on her future plans, but has jokingly said she was considering running for several offices in 2026. During his first day in office, Begich reintroduced three pieces of legislation that had been introduced by Peltola during her first year in office but stalled in the Republican-controlled House. The three bills already passed the Senate, where they were sponsored by Murkowski. In a statement earlier this week, Murkowski called the measures \"non-controversial\" and said she was optimistic they could pass early in the congressional term. All three of the measures are related to the rights of Alaska Native people under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The first would exclude settlement trust benefits for disabled and elderly Alaskans when determining eligibility for federal government assistance, such as food assistance or supplemental income from the Social Security Administration. The second would allow several communities in Southeast Alaska to form new Alaska Native corporations and receive land allotments from the Tongass National Forest. The third would turn over undeveloped land to Alaska Native village corporations rather than having it kept in trust for future residents. The measure, which would ease the path toward new development and resource extraction projects, is supported by the Alaska Federation of Natives, Gov. Mike Dunleavy and the Alaska Legislature, which last year passed a resolution unanimously supporting the federal legislation. In a statement, Begich said the introduction of the bills during his first day in office showed that he is \"hitting the ground running to advocate for our state's future.\" View Comments Terms and
