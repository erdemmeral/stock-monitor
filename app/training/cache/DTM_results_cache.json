processing facility, local mining town, sealed highway, airport, regional rail infrastructure and 25kV hydro power to the processing site Cygnus Executive Chairman, David Southam said : \u201cWe are delighted to hit the ground running with an excellent intersection from a previously undrilled area which is only 250m away from main Corner Bay Deposit. \u201cThis result supports our view that there is much more to find at Chibougamau, both near the existing deposits and in the wider region, and is consistent with our strategy to create shareholder value by growing the resource. \u201cThe downhole geophysics is already proving to be a key tool for the project and will help us unlock other under-explored areas of the project\u201d. 1 The Mineral Resource Estimate at the Chibougamau Project is a foreign estimate prepared in accordance with CIM Standards. A competent person has not done sufficient work to classify the foreign estimate as a mineral resource in accordance with the JORC Code, and it is uncertain whether further evaluation and exploration will result in an estimate reportable under the JORC Code. TORONTO and PERTH, Australia, Jan. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cygnus Metals Limited (ASX: CY5; TSXV: CYG) (\u201cCygnus\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is pleased to announce that it has made an outstanding start to its exploration campaign at the Chibougamau Copper-Gold Project in Quebec, Canada, with the first hole returning assays of up to 2.5m @ 9.1% Copper . Story Continues Prior to the merger of Cygnus and Dor\u00e9 Copper Mining Corp. closing, both teams executed a targeted exploration program to test the immediate areas around the Corner Bay deposit, looking for both additional structures and extensions to the current resource. The first drillhole from this program has returned an intersection of 7.3m @ 4.2% Cu, 0.3g/t Au & 16.6g/t Ag, including 2.5m @ 9.1% Cu, 0.5g/t Au & 31.4g/t Ag from a potential new lode ~250m east of the existing resource in the footwall of the Corner Bay deposit. Follow up downhole electromagnetics has since defined a significant off hole electromagnetic anomaly (530m x 460m) to the north and down dip of the intersection that has yet to be tested by drilling.

Figure 1_Long Section Figure 1: Long section of the Corner Bay deposit with potential new lode in the footwall of the main deposit. Large 530mx460m untested EM plate along with further untested EM plates to the south. About the Drilling and Geophysical Results The first hole of the program (CB-24-100) targeting the footwall of the Corner Bay deposit has intersected a potential new sub parallel lode with a high-grade drill result of 7.3m @ 4.2% Cu, 0.3g/t Au & 16.6g/t Ag from 317.8m, which includes 2.5m @ 9.1% Cu, 0.5g/t Au & 31.4g/t Ag . The result highlights the potential for multiple sub-parallel lodes at the Corner Bay deposit analogous to other well-known deposits in the region. This new structure sits 250m to the east of the Main Lode at Corner Bay in an area with very little drilling. This presents an exciting target for follow up drilling and an opportunity to add to the existing resources at Corner Bay. In addition, follow up electromagnetics (\u2018EM\u2019) completed on the recent drilling has defined a large (530m x 460m) conductive plate offset to the north and down dip of drillhole CB-24-100. EM is known to correspond well with the mineralisation style at the Chibougamau mining camp, being primarily composed of chalcopyrite with minor amounts of pyrite and pyrrhotite. Historically, airborne EM has been used to make some of the discoveries in the region, although ground and downhole EM has been underutilised in more recent times. The large EM plate provides a priority target for follow up exploration along this structure.

Ongoing Drilling In line with the Company\u2019s resource growth strategy, drilling is underway with two diamond drill rigs. This initial program will focus on resource growth opportunities surrounding some of the existing deposits aiming to build upon the existing high-grade resources. The Company looks forward to a high volume of news flow during 2025 with ongoing drilling updates and results. About the Corner Bay Deposit Cygnus\u2019 flagship Corner Bay deposit within the Chibougamau Project is located 17km (straight line) south of the Chibougamau processing facility. The deposit was discovered in the 1980s and has never been mined although ramp access was established to 115m for the purpose of initial bulk sampling test work. The deposit is the primary resource in the combined Project resources, making up 79% of the total resource with Indicated Mineral Resources of 2.7Mt @ 2.7% Cu & 0.3g/t Au and Inferred Mineral Resources of 5.9Mt @ 3.4% Cu and 0.3g/t Au. 1 Mineralisation extends from surface and has been defined over 1,000m of strike and to a depth of 1,350m with mineralisation remaining open in all directions. The mineralisation is structurally controlled and hosted as a north-south striking quartz-carbonate vein with semi massive chalcopyrite and minor pyrite mineralisation. The main lode has been crosscut and offset by a large diabase dyke with an upper and lower portion of the lode positioned either side of the dyke. The Corner Bay deposit sits on the southern flank of the Chibougamau pluton and has seen minimal exploration compared to the north. The northern flank is host to 16 mined deposits and has contributed a significant portion of the regions historic production ~945,000t of copper and 3.5Moz of gold. 2 Corner Bay in the south shares comparable lithological and structural characteristics to the northern deposits, however, as the northern mines developed, multiple sub-parallel lodes were subsequently discovered within the same structural corridor. Due to the relatively early stage of defining the Corner Bay deposit, potential parallel lodes and resource extension have not yet been properly explored and the latest intersection highlights the potential for additional sub-parallel lodes within the immediate vicinity of the current resources. About the Chibougamau Copper-Gold Project The Chibougamau copper-gold project (\u201cChibougamau Project\u201d) is located in central Quebec, Canada approximately 480km due north of Montreal. The province of Quebec has been recognised as a top ten global mining investment jurisdiction in the 2023 Fraser Institute Annual Survey of Mining Companies. The project has excellent infrastructure with a local mining town, sealed highway, airport, regional rail infrastructure and access to hydro power via installed powerlines. The Chibougamau Project is centred on the Chibougamau pluton with a district wide historic production of 53.5Mt @ 1.8% Cu and 2.1g/t Au 2 with periodic mining between the early 1900s and 2008. Over this long mining history, the district has produced over 945,000t of copper and 3.5Moz of gold from 16 former producing mines. 2 The Chibougamau Project has high-grade resources including a Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources of 3.6Mt at 2.5% Cu & 0.6g/t Au and Inferred Mineral Resources of 7.2Mt at 3.0% Cu & 1.1g/t Au with significant potential to grow. 1 The Company has a clear strategy to: Rapidly grow the resource through brownfield exploration and investment in drilling; and Advance the project towards development through study work and utilising existing infrastructure. The Company sees a huge opportunity to create shareholder value by an established high-grade resource with opportunity for growth, excellent infrastructure, 900ktpa processing facility and clear pathway to production, all within a quality endowed mineral terrane that has seen minimal modern exploration.

These examples should not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling. All current drilling conducted at the Chibougamau Project was completed under the supervision of a registered professional geologist as a Qualified Person (QP) who is responsible and accountable for the planning, execution, and supervision of all exploration activity as well as the implementation of quality assurance programs and reporting. All drilling reported is NQ2 (47.8 mm diameter) Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems used. All sample collection, core logging, and specific gravity determinations were completed by Cygnus Metals under the supervision of a professionally qualified registered geologist. NQ core was marked for splitting during logging and is sawn using a diamond core saw with a mounted jig to assure the core is cut lengthwise into equal halves. Half of the cut core is placed in clean individual plastic bags with the appropriate sample tag. QA/QC is done in house by Cygnus Metals geologists with oversight from the Senior Geologist. The check samples (blanks and standards \u2013 4% of total samples with another 2% of core duplicates taken on half split core) that were inserted into the sample batches are verified against their certified values and are deemed a pass if they are within 3 standard deviations of the certified value. The duplicates are evaluated against each other to determine mineralization distribution (nugget). If there are large discrepancies in the check samples, then the entire batch is requested to be re-assayed. The samples are then placed in bags for shipment to the offsite laboratory\u2019s facility. The remaining half of the core is retained and incorporated into Cygnus\u2019s secure, core library located on the property Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the Public Report. In cases where \u2018industry standard\u2019 work has been done this would be relatively simple (eg \u2018reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay\u2019). In other cases more explanation may be required, such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (eg submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information. Industry standard sampling practices were used with sample lengths ranging from 0.3 m to 1.0 m and respected geological contacts. Sample tags were placed at the beginning of each sample interval and the tag numbers were recorded in an MS Excel database. Sampling practice is considered to be appropriate to the geology and style of mineralisation Drilling techniques Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other type, whether core is oriented and if so, by what method, etc). Diamond core was drilled using surface diamond rigs with industry recognised contractors Miikan Drilling. Miikan is a joint venture between Chibougamau Diamond Drilling Ltd., the First Nations community of Ouje-Bougoumou and the First Nations community of Mistissini both located in the Eeyou Istchee territory. Drilling was conducted using NQ core size Directional surveys have been taken at 50m intervals Drill sample recovery Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and results assessed. Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure representative nature of the samples. Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade and whether sample bias may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material. Diamond core recovery was measured for each run and calculated as a percentage of the drilled interval. Overall, the core recoveries are excellent in the Chibougamau area Logging Whether core and chip samples have been geologically and geotechnically logged to a level of detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies and metallurgical studies. All core was geologically and geotechnically logged. Lithology, veining, alteration and mineralisation are recorded in multiple tables of the drillhole database Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature. Core (or costean, channel, etc) photography. Geological logging of core is qualitative and descriptive in nature. The total length and percentage of the relevant intersections logged. 100% of the core has been logged Sub-sampling techniques and sample preparation If core, whether cut or sawn and whether quarter, half or all core taken. If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary split, etc and whether sampled wet or dry. For all sample types, the nature, quality and appropriateness of the sample preparation technique. Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-sampling stages to maximise representivity of samples. Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is representative of the in-situ material collected, including for instance results for field duplicate/second-half sampling. Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size of the material being sampled. The NQ2 diameter the core was sawn in half following a sample cutting line determined by geologists during logging and submitted for analysis on nominal 1m intervals or defined by geological boundaries determined by the logging geologist Each core sample is assigned a tag with a unique identifying number. Sample lengths are typically one metre but can be depending on zone mineralogy and boundaries. This sampling technique is industry standard and deemed appropriate. Quality of assay data and laboratory tests The nature, quality and appropriateness of the assaying and laboratory procedures used and whether the technique is considered partial or total. Sample (NQ size half core) preparation and fire assay analysis were done at Bureau Veritas Commodities Canada Ltd (\u201cBV\u201d) in Timmins, Ontario, and ICP-ES multi-elements analysis was done at BV in Vancouver, B.C. Samples were weighed, dried, crushed to 70% passing 2\u00a0mm, split to 250\u00a0g, and pulverized to 85% passing 75 \u00b5m. Samples are fire assayed for gold (Au) (30\u00a0g) and multi-acid digestion ICP-ES finish, for 23 elements (including key elements Ag, Cu, Mo). Samples assaying >10.0 g/t Au are re-analysed with a gravimetric finish using a 30 g charge. Samples assaying >10% Cu are re-analysed with a sodium peroxide fusion with ICP-ES analysis using a 0.25 g charge. For geophysical tools, spectrometers, handheld XRF instruments, etc, the parameters used in determining the analysis including instrument make and model, reading times, calibrations factors applied and their derivation, etc. None used. Nature of quality control procedures adopted (eg standards, blanks, duplicates, external laboratory checks) and whether acceptable levels of accuracy (i.e. lack of bias) and precision have been established. Laboratory QC procedures involve the use of internal certified reference material as assay standards, along with blanks, duplicates and replicates Verification of sampling and assaying The verification of significant intersections by either independent or alternative company personnel. Verification of sampling was made by Cygnus Metals and other professional consultant geologists The use of twinned holes. No hole is twinned Documentation of primary data, data entry procedures, data verification, data storage (physical and electronic) protocols. All logging data was completed, core marked up, logging and sampling data was entered directly into the database. The logged data is stored on the site server directly. Discuss any adjustment to assay data. There was no adjustment to the assay data Location of data points Accuracy and quality of surveys used to locate drill holes (collar and down-hole surveys), trenches, mine workings and other locations used in Mineral Resource estimation. The location of the drillholes and the aiming points for the orientation of the drillholes were indicated on the ground using identified stakes. The stakes marking the location of the drillholes were set up and located with a Garmin GPS model \u201cGPSmap 62s\u201d (4m accuracy) Surveys are collected using a Reflex EZ-Shot\u00ae single-shot electronic instrument with readings collected at intervals of approximately every 30 m downhole plus a reading at the bottom of the hole Specification of the grid system used. The grid system used is UTM NAD83 (Zone 18) Quality and adequacy of topographic control. A Digital Terrane Model (DTM) has been used to accurately plot the vertical position of the holes Data spacing and distribution Data spacing for reporting of Exploration Results. The spacing is considered appropriate for this type of exploration Whether the data spacing and distribution is sufficient to establish the degree of geological and grade continuity appropriate for the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimation procedure(s) and classifications applied. No resource estimation is made Whether sample compositing has been applied. No sample compositing has been applied Orientation of data in relation to geological structure Whether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased sampling of possible structures and the extent to which this is known, considering the deposit type. Drilling is orientated approximately at right angles to the currently interpreted strike of the known interpreted mineralisation. Reported intersections appear close to true width If the relationship between the drilling orientation and the orientation of key mineralised structures is considered to have introduced a sampling bias, this should be assessed and reported if material. No bias is considered to have been introduced by the existing sampling orientation Sample security The measures taken to ensure sample security. Core was placed in wooden core boxes close to the drill rig by the drilling contractor. The core was collected daily by the drilling contractor and delivered to the secure core logging facility.

The Chibougamau Copper and Gold project comprising Corner Bay, Devlin, Cedar Bay and Joe Mann have seen an extensive exploration history dating back to the early 1900s. The PEA (as referred to in the Company\u2019s announcement of 15 October 2024) provides a detailed history of the exploration activities undertaken by previous explorers.

Corner Bay and Devlin are located at the northeastern extremity of the Abitibi subprovince in the Superior province of the Canadian Shield and are examples of Chibougamau-type copper-gold deposits. The Abitibi subprovince is considered as one of the largest and best-preserved greenstone belts in the world and hosts numerous gold and base metal deposits. The Corner Bay deposit is located on the southern flank of the Dor\u00e9 Lake Complex (DLC). It is hosted by a N 15\u00b0 trending shear zone more or less continuous with a strong 75\u00b0 to 85\u00b0 dip towards the west. The host anorthosite rock is sheared and sericitized over widths of 2 m to 25 m. The deposit is cut by a diabase dyke and is limited to the north by a fault structure and to the south by the LaChib deformation zone. The Corner Bay deposit consists of three main mineralized lodes (subparallel Main Lode 1 and Main Lode 2 above the dyke, and Main Lode below the dyke that make up the bulk of the deposit. The Corner Bay deposit has been traced over a strike length to over 1,100 m to a depth of 1,350 m and remains open at depth. The mineralization is characterized by veins and/or lenses of massive to semi-massive sulphides associated with a brecciated to locally massive quartz-calcite material. The sulphide assemblage is composed of chalcopyrite, pyrite, and pyrrhotite with lesser amounts of molybdenite and sphalerite. Late remobilized quartz-chalcopyrite-pyrite veins occur in a wide halo around the main mineralization zones. Devlin is a flat-lying, copper-rich lodes-hosted deposit in a polygenic igneous breccia that is less than 100 m from the surface. The tabular bodies have been modelled as four nearly horizontal lodes: a more continuous lower zone and three smaller lodes comprising the upper zone. Mineralization is reflected as a fracture zone often composed of two or more sulphide-quartz lodes and stringers. Thickness of the mineralized zones range from 0.5 m to 4.4 m. It has been diluted during modelling to reflect a minimum mining height of 1.8 m. The Joe Mann deposit is characterized by east-west striking shear hosted lodes that extend beyond 1,000 m vertically with mineralization identified over a 3 km strike length. These shear zones form part of the Opawica-Guercheville deformation zone, a major deformation corridor cutting the mafic volcanic rocks of the Obatogamau Formation in the north part of the Caopatina Segment. The gabbro sill hosts the Main Zone and the West Zone at the mine, while the South Zone is found in the rhyolite. These three subvertical E-W (N275\u00b0/85\u00b0) ductile-brittle shear zones are sub-parallel to stratigraphy and to one another, with up to 140 m to 170 m of separation between them. These shear zones are hosted within a stratigraphic package composed of iron-magnesium (Fe-Mg) carbonate and sericite altered gabbro sills, sheared basalts, and intermediate to felsic tuffs intruded by various felsic intrusions. The Joe Mann gold mineralization is hosted by decimetre scale quartz-carbonate lodes (Dion and Guha 1988). The lodes are mineralized with pyrite, pyrrhotite, and chalcopyrite disposed in lens and lodelets parallel to schistosity, and occasionally visible gold. There are some other minor, mineralized structures, e.g., North and South-South Zones, with limited vertical and horizontal extensions. Drill hole Information A summary of all information material to the understanding of the exploration results including a tabulation of the following information for all Material drill holes: easting and northing of the drill hole collar elevation or RL (Reduced Level \u2013 elevation above sea level in metres) of the drill hole collar dip and azimuth of the hole down hole length and interception depth hole length. If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the information is not Material and this exclusion does not detract from the understanding of the report, the Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the case. All requisite drillhole information is tabulated elsewhere in this release. Refer Appendix A of the body text Data aggregation methods In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated. All drill hole intersections are reported above a lower cut-off grade of 0.5% copper. Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high-grade results and longer lengths of low-grade results, the procedure used for such aggregation should be stated and some typical examples of such aggregations should be shown in detail. A maximum of 1m internal waste was allowed The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values should be clearly stated. No metal equivalents reported Relationship between mineralisation widths and intercept lengths These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of Exploration Results. If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole angle is known, its nature should be reported. If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there should be a clear statement to this effect (eg \u2018down hole length, true width not known\u2019). All intersections reported in the body of this release are down hole. The majority of the drill holes in the database are drilled as close to orthogonal to the plane of the mineralized lodes as possible. Only down hole lengths are reported. Diagrams Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being reported These should include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views. Included elsewhere in this release. Refer figures in the body text Balanced reporting Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results. All results greater than 0.5% Cu and 0.5g/t Au have been reported at greater than 1m width Other substantive exploration data Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including (but not limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples \u2013 size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating substances. Appropriate plans are included in the body of this release. Further work The nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling). Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions, including the main geological interpretations and future drilling areas, provided this information is not commercially sensitive. The Company will be conducting drill testing of additional mineralisation as well as step out drilling of existing lodes to further enhance the resources quoted in this release. More information is presented in the body of this report. Diagrams in the main body of this release show areas of possible resource extension on existing lodes. The company continues to identify and assess multiple other target areas within the property boundary for additional resources.

Recent drilling and geophysical programs, including induced polarization (ongoing) and drone borne aeromagnetics has led to an expanded and enlarged re-interpretation of the geological model used to explore Cowley Park. The new model supports the existence of an offsetting NNE dextral fault displacing mineralization thereby significantly enlarging the exploration potential of Cowley Park. Three newly identified geophysical anomalies will be drill tested as part of the 2025 drill program. Gladiator CEO, Jason Bontempo, commented: \" In 2024 we successfully extended high-grade mineralization along strike and at depth and identified three new, highly prospective geophysical targets which promise to significantly expand the known extents of Cowley Park if successful. This work confirmed our belief that Cowley Park will deliver a material cornerstone high-grade copper resource inventory within our 35km long Whitehorse Copper Belt Project, where we are initially targeting over 100mt of high-grade copper resources along the belt. We are excited to commence our 2025 phase 1 drill campaign at Cowley Park. With a treasury exceeding $18M, we are well-funded to complete an aggressive drill program on and around Cowley Park to assess its true size potential with the objective of delivering a maiden resource as soon as possibl,e as well as follow-up on the other Whitehorse Copper Belt exploration targets.\" Resumption of Drilling Drilling is planned to resume in early February, initially targeting the strike and down dip extensions to the high grade exoskarn intersected in recent drilling (Figures 1 and 2) that returned significant high-grade mineralization over broad widths in CPG-045, CPG-047 and CPG-049. These holes support mineralization continuing for at least 220 metres from near surface down dip whilst remaining open at depth, to the west and towards the east. Significant results from Gladiator's 2024 drill program include: Story Continues CPG-047 - 98m @ 1.49% Cu , 0.04 g/t Au, 3.68 g/t Ag & 187 ppm Mo from 103m including 20m @ 5.53% Cu , 0.07 g/t Au, 11.47 g/t Ag & 229 ppm Mo from 145m, including 14m @ 7.67% Cu , 0.07 g/t Au, 15.16 g/t Ag & 217 ppm Mo from 145m CPG-049 - 79m @ 1.37% Cu , 0.06 g/t Au, 4.38 g/t Ag & 261 ppm Mo from 71m including 26m @ 3.31% Cu , 0.06 g/t Au, 8.97 g/t Ag & 44 ppm Mo from 88m CPG-045 - 38m @ 1.01% Cu , 0.06 g/t Au, 4.83 g/t Ag & 604 ppm Mo from 96m including 12m @ 1.73% Cu, 0.10 g/t Au, 7.75 g/t Ag & 1,052 ppm Mo from 96m & 4m @ 2.50% Cu , 0.10 g/t Au, 11.15 g/t Ag & 1,051 ppm Mo from 122m Hole CPG-018 (drilled by Gladiator in 2023) intersected minor skarn mineralization over the last 1.6m of the hole (200.1 to 202.69m EOH). With the results of CPG-047, mineralization is now believed to remain open at depth. Gladiator plans to further test the down dip potential of this zone by extending CPG-018 along with drilling further holes along strike upon the restart of drilling in February 2025.

The new model supports the existence of an offsetting NNE dextral fault displacing mineralization significantly enlarging the exploration potential of Cowley Park. Identification of the fault has opened the possibility to extensive exploration potential along strike of known mineralization and has identified a further three untested magnetic responses proximal to known mineralization and the emplaced granodiorite (intrusive) hosting the Cowley Park prospect (see Figure 3). The Company believes the previous geological interpretation prematurely constrained the strike extents of the known high grade exoskarn mineralization. The 2024 drill program has confirmed the Company's belief that mineralization associated with the higher-grade exoskarn is now open at depth and along strike and is not constrained as implied by the previous model.

To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit: https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/1930/238047_6ef71813c4598a5b_004full.jpg Mineralization within the exoskarn is now interpreted to be occurring as a wide zone of high-grade mineralization contained within a broader mineralized skarn that is steep to moderately dipping (approximately -70 degrees to the south), rather than flattening at depth and returning to the near surface in the south (previously described as \"The Bowl\" Interpretation). The new geological model supports that: The two main existing lodes (Northern & Southern) are now thought to be separated by a large regional lateral (dextral) off-setting fault that is of a similar orientation to that found at the Little Chief Mine. This implies that previous drilling was unable to detect the projected lodes across the fault, specifically the southern lode on the western side of the fault where the emplacement of the granodiorite is dominant. Mineralization appears to be associated with the gradient (from low to high) of the magnetic response proximal to the intrusive system (granodiorite), implying that significant untested exploration potential exists to the north and south of the emplaced granodiorite. The new interpretation of the intrusive contact suggests the system remains open along strike, as drilling completed to date has not yet fully tested the strike extents of the magnetic gradients. The Company believes known higher grade exoskarn style mineralization that occurs proximal to the contact, including to the northwest and east of the \"Northern Lode\" and to the east of the \"Southern Lode\" could be extended further east. Magnetics has also identified similar untested anomalies (Figure 3) proximal or along strike to identified mineralization surrounding the emplaced granodiorite at Cowley Park. Drill planning to test these anomalies in 2025 is underway. Mineralization within the endoskarn is now interpreted as being defined by brittle deformation proximal to the endoskarn-exoskarn contact and is moderately to steeply dipping (to the south) localised to the contact.

make its first manned flight later this year (JUSTIN TALLIS) A Slovak entrepreneur is providing most of the funds to rescue a German flying taxi startup that came close to collapse last month, the firm's new backers said Thursday. Lilium had already filed for bankruptcy and was just hours from folding entirely on Christmas Eve when a consortium of investors swooped in to save it. The consortium said a key figure is entrepreneur Marian Bocek, who runs holding company DTM Investment and founded Slovak battery manufacturer InoBat. It is understood that Bocek, aged in his 40s, is providing more than 100 million euros ($103 million) in funding, out of more than 200 million euros from the consortium. Germany's Bild daily first revealed the investor's identity. A consortium spokesman said they now needed to find other partners and customers to launch production in earnest. The group also said it has changed its name from Mobile Uplift Corporation to Lilium Aerospace. Bocek's InoBat is already a supplier to Lilium. Chinese battery maker Gotion owns a substantial stake in InoBat. Lilium has been developing small electric-powered jets that can take off and land vertically. Founded in 2015, the company attracted substantial interest, with 100 firm orders for its jets to date and hundreds more pre-orders. It burnt through huge amounts of money in development costs, however, and initially turned to the state for emergency funding, but the request was rejected. This led the firm to declare bankruptcy in October before the new consortium of investors emerged. Lilium has yet to conduct a manned test flight. The first trial is expected this year, followed by the first anticipated deliveries to customers in 2026. sr/fz/rl View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard Recommended Stories",

Stratasys Launches TrueDent\u2122 in Europe (Photo: Business Wire) TrueDent-D\u2122 resin is now available in major European markets that require CE marking, with strong customer interest already building EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. & REHOVOT, Israel, January 14, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Stratasys (NASDAQ: SSYS) has declared that its TrueDent-D\u2122 resin is available for sale in Europe as a CE Mark Class I medical device. This milestone enables the sale of its TrueDent\u2122 monolithic multi-shade digital denture solution in European countries that require CE marking. Following its successful debut in the United States in 2023, TrueDent is now set to deliver a scalable, efficient, and high-quality solution for denture production for dental labs and clinicians across Europe. Interest in the TrueDent-D resin is already strong, with more than 30 customers committed to onboarding in Q1 2025. According to a recent iData report 1 , the demand for denture solutions in Europe continues to grow as the region\u2019s opportunity for dentures is projected to expand from USD 2.19 billion in 2023 to USD 2.45 billion by 2028. The TrueDent denture solution by Stratasys is designed to answer this demand with a fully digital workflow that enables dental labs to produce customized dentures efficiently, offering dentists and patients an improved outcome in fewer appointments. Stratasys estimates the total cost for a lab to produce a TrueDent denture is less than half of those produced by traditional means. One Stratasys J5 DentaJet\u2122 printer can produce more than 30 full monolithic, multi-shade dentures per print job, a figure unmatched in the industry. A key feature is the ability to print a duplicate denture with a click of a button enabling clinicians to quickly provide a spare or a backup for their patients. TrueDent is the only solution in the world that can produce identical dentures when needed, offering not just fit, form and function, but also aesthetics. This capability creates potential for new business models, allowing customers to scale production without increasing costs or labor requirements. \"The TrueDent solution has transformed our denture business,\" said Tra\u2019 Chambers, Owner of Express Dental Laboratories, a leading U.S. TrueDent customer. \"The streamlined digital workflow and precision allows us to produce up to 225 dental appliances per day while delivering high fidelity, highly aesthetic appliances to our customers. The Stratasys TrueDent offering has elevated the level of care we can provide, saving time and costs for both clinicians and patients.\" Edentulism, the condition of being without natural teeth, affects over 267.5 million people globally, including a prevalence rate exceeding 10% among adults over 50 in many regions. The percentage of denture cases produced using digital methods in the U.S. has risen from 5% in 2022 to 11% in 2024. Similarly, European dental labs are increasingly adopting digital workflows to address labor shortages and meet patient needs faster and with greater accuracy. Story Continues The TrueDent denture solution elevates the challenges faced by labs that are limited by current fabrication methods that often involve the need for manual assembly by skilled craftspeople. TrueDent is already proving its value in the U.S., where it has transformed the way dental labs operate. By implementing an unattended streamlined digital workflow, TrueDent eliminates 27 or more manual touchpoints per print, reduces chair time for dental professionals and patients, and enhances patient satisfaction with high-aesthetic, true-to-design fit, form and function appliances. \"We are thrilled to bring TrueDent-D to Europe,\" said Erez Ben Zvi, Vice President of Healthcare at Stratasys. \"Our monolithic TrueDent denture solution combines high fidelity, aesthetics, and production scalability, while reducing labor costs and enabling exact reproductions. There is growing excitement across the region for this innovative solution, which not only improves the experience for dental professionals but also elevates the standard of care for patients.\" For more information about the TrueDent digital denture application, visit the Stratasys TrueDent page . 1 \u2013 iData Europe Market Report Suite for Dental Prosthetics, February 2024 About Stratasys Stratasys is leading the global shift to additive manufacturing with innovative 3D printing solutions for industries such as aerospace, automotive, consumer products, and healthcare.

of 1.23% Cu and 20m of 1.22% Cu at Cowley Park and Returns 40.2m of 1.74% Cu from Unassayed Historic Core Newsfile Corp. Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 1:00 AM 28 min read In This Article: GDTRF +6.81% SUMMARY Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - January 13, 2025) - Gladiator Metals Corp (TSXV: GLAD) (OTCQB: GDTRF) (FSE: ZX7) (\"Gladiator\" or the \"Company\") announces that it has received the final outstanding results from the remaining 10 diamond drill holes of the recently completed Cowley Park drill program. Additionally, the Company has completed assaying of 11 holes (1,427m) of unassayed historic core. These drill intercepts support the revised geological framework ahead of planned 2025 resource definition and exploration drilling. Recently returned significant intercepts include: 36m @ 1.23% Cu from 49m ( 0.22 g/t Au , 7.53 g/t Ag & 494 ppm Mo), including 6m @ 1.53% Cu from 61m ( 1.02 g/t Au , 13.1g/t Ag & 262 ppm Mo) - CPG-039 24m @ 1.05% Cu from 84m (0.07 g/t Au, 7.02 g/t Ag & 978 ppm Mo) within 32m @ 0.90% Cu from 82m (0.06 g/t Au, 6.02 g/t Ag & 942ppm Mo)- CPG-037 8m @ 1.23% Cu from 69m (0.12 g/t Au, 5.6 g/t Ag & 161 ppm Mo) within 52m @ 0.55% Cu from 63m (0.05 g/t Au, 2.27 g/t Ag, & 238 ppm Mo) - CPG-036 20m @ 1.22% Cu from 118m (0.03 g/t Au, 5.29 g/t Ag & 317 ppm Mo) within 52m @ 0.73% Cu from 88m (0.04 g/t Au, 4.56 g/t Ag & 255 ppm Mo) - CPG-051 10m @ 1.04% Cu from 103m ( 0.22 g/t Au, 8.48 g/t Ag & 1,955 ppm Mo ) within 50m @ 0.54%Cu from 67m (0.07 g/t Au, 4.02 g/t Ag & 557 ppm Mo) - CPG-062 and 22m @ 1.02% Cu from 117m (0.10 g/t Au, 11.25 g/t Ag & 319 ppm Mo) within 38m @ 0.84% Cu from 109m (0.08 g/t Au, 8.03 g/t Ag & 253 ppm Mo) from the far eastern extent of drilling completed to date at Cowley - CPG-033 Additionally, Gladiator's team re-logged and re-assayed 11 previously unassayed, historic diamond drill holes. Significant intercepts include: 23.04m @ 1.59% Cu from 74.98m (0.15 g/t Au, 10.28 g/t Ag & 460 ppm Mo) plus 4.88m @ 3.45% Cu from 81.38m (0.30 g/t Au, 25.45 g/t Ag & 949ppm Mo) & 4.75m @ 1.91% Cu from 93.27m (0.15 g/t Au, 7.6 g/t Ag & 594 ppm Mo) within 31.09m @ 1.27% Cu from 71.02m (0.12 g/t Au, 8.34 g/t Ag & 374 ppm Mo) - 18-CP-06 13.30m @ 2.10% Cu from 48.70m (0.08 g/t Au, 12.06 g/t Ag & 761 ppm Mo) Including 8.00m @ 3.02% Cu from 50m (0.11 g/t Au, 18.30 g/t Ag & 981 ppm Mo) - CP-142 40.20m @ 1.74% Cu from 32.30m (0.11 g/t Au, 7.57 g/t Ag & 515 ppm Mo) - CP-144 Assaying of the historic diamond drill core has confirmed significant co-product credits consisting of gold, silver and molybdenum with the copper mineralization. Recent drilling confirms the Company's belief that Cowley Park has the potential to host a significant economic copper resource. Story Continues Gladiator's 2024 drilling has identified: significant upside identified down dip and along strike associated with high-grade mineralization (exoskarn), including results of 98m @ 1.49% Cu from 103m (0.04 g/t Au, 3.68 g/t Ag & 187 ppm Mo) including 20m @ 5.53% Cu from 145m (0.07 g/t Au, 11.47 g/t Ag & 229 ppm Mo), or 14m @ 7.67% Cu from 145m (0.07 g/t Au, 15.16 g/t Ag & 217 ppm Mo) - CPG-047 broad intersections of newly identified endoskarn (intrusive associated) mineralization, found to be consistent with or better than observed in historic drilling. The wider intervals were further enhanced with the addition of previously unassayed complimentary co-products to copper including molybdenum, gold, and silver. Gladiator CEO, Jason Bontempo commented: \" Cowley Park continues to exceed our initial expectations. Completion of the 2024 drill season has not only confirmed broader intervals of copper mineralization but has confirmed continuity of higher grade exoskarn mineralization that now appears opens along strike and at depth, leading us to believe mineralization has the potential to extend well beyond our previous geological interpretation. Additional drone magnetics and IP work completed in 2024 is being compiled and interpreted to better understand 2025 exploration targets that have the potential to expand Cowley Park.\" COWLEY PARK DRILLING Gladiator completed 34 diamond drill holes (CPG-031 to 064) for 6,104m at Cowley Park (Table 1 & Figure 1) during its late 2024 drilling. Drilling was designed to: Confirm and test the continuity of near surface, high-grade copper mineralization along four systematic drill fences (Section Lines) spaced 120-220m apart identified from previous drilling for future high-grade copper resource definition (Figure 1). Test new shallow, undrilled, chargeability anomalies identified from recently completed Induced Polarization (IP) surveys, potentially related to unrecognized copper sulfide bodies. Test significant exploration upside including extensions to known high-grade copper skarn mineralization and test sub-parallel trends recently identified in drilling. Test the previously unrecognized resource potential of the endoskarn copper mineralization at Cowley Park which has not been systematically targeted or sampled in historic drilling. Test the economic potential of complimentary co-products to copper mineralization including molybdenum, gold, and silver. Figure 1: Plan map of all drilling at Cowley Park over LIDAR DTM.

This is further enhanced by CPG-049 (drilled as a twin of 19-CP-04) that was designed to test for significant high-grade mineralization believed to be truncated by historic hole \"19-CP-04\". This historic hole was, subsequently interpreted to be inconsistent in terms of its mineralization and geology when compared to the surrounding holes returning: 98m @ 1.49% Cu from 103m (0.04 g/t Au, 3.68 g/t Ag & 187 ppm Mo) including 20m @ 5.53% Cu from 145m (0.07 g/t Au, 11.47 g/t Ag & 229 ppm Mo), or 14m @ 7.67% Cu from 145m (0.07 g/t Au, 15.16 g/t Ag & 217 ppm Mo)- CPG-047 79m @ 1.37% Cu from 71m (0.06 g/t Au, 4.38 g/t Ag & 261 ppm Mo) including 26m @ 3.31% Cu from 88m (0.06 g/t Au, 8.97 g/t Ag & 44 ppm Mo) - CPG-049 38m @ 1.01% Cu from 96m (0.06 g/t Au, 4.83 g/t Ag & 604 ppm Mo) including 12m @ 1.73% Cu from 96m ( 0.10 g/t Au, 7.75 g/t Ag & 1,052 ppm Mo) & 4m @ 2.50% Cu from 122 m (0.10 g/t Au, 11.15 g/t Ag & 1,051 ppm Mo) - CPG-045 CPG-049, supported by additional mineralization intersected in CPG-045 and CPG-047 suggests mineralization continues for at least 220 metres from near surface down dip on Line 3 (Figure 4), remaining open at depth and to the east and west along strike. These holes confirm Gladiator's belief that copper mineralization including molybdenum, gold and silver at Cowley Park continues near surface, is high-grade and remains open along strike and down dip in all directions with significant resource expansion opportunities both within AND outside the area of historic drilling. The Company is also looking at targeting strike extensions and the potential of the higher-grade mineralization to continue east towards historic drilling (Figure 1) that returned: 15.85m @ 6.37% Cu from 84.43m, Including 12.5m @ 8.02% Cu from 85.04m - 18-CP-04 (collared ~60m east of Section Line 3) and 43.28m @ 2.24% Cu from 93.27m, Including 13.72m @ 5.41% Cu from 109.42m - 19-CP-08 (collared ~110m east of CPG-047-049). Refer to Press Release dated May 8, 2024 Section Line 1 Section Line 1 was designed to follow up on drilling completed by Gladiator in 2023 that returned significant broad mineralized intersections and elevated Au, Ag & Mo, Including: 20m @ 1.43% Cu from 42m (0.07 g/t Au, 3.96 g/t Ag & 254 ppm Mo) within 71m @ 0.72% Cu from 32m (0.04 g/t Au, 2.08 g/t Ag & 143 ppm Mo) - CPG-001 13m @ 1.44% Cu from 28m (0.31 g/t Au, 10.53 g/t Ag & 1,564 ppm Mo) and 33m @ 1.48% Cu from 71m (0.25 g/t Au, 8.31 g/t Au & 404ppm Mo) within 113m @ 0.79% Cu from 19m (0.13 g/t Au, 4.75 g/t Ag & 464 ppm Mo) - CPG-002 5m @ 1.23% Cu from 9m (0.12 g/t Au, 10.44 g/t Ag & 1,121 ppm Mo) and 13.2m @ 2.26% Cu from 22.8m (0.34 g/t Au, 17.96 g/t Au & 833 ppm Mo) - CPG-003 Drilling confirmed the presence of a bounding structure (interpreted fault) on the northern side of the mineralization (CPG-052) and that the previous interpretation of the mineralization flattening at depth and returning to surface on the southern portion of the system (\"Bowl\" Interpretation) appears to be incorrect. Mineralization within the endoskarn is now interpreted as being defined by the brittle deformation within the skarn and is moderately steeply dipping (to the south). Drilling returned a best result of: 8m @ 1.07% Cu from 85m ( 0.36 g/t Au, 8.03 g/t Ag & 2,032 ppm Mo ) within 28m @ 0.56% Cu from 79m (0.12 g/t Au, 3.30 g/t Ag & 956 ppm Mo) - CPG-055 Figure 2: Section (Line 1) through the Cowley Park prospect looking 280 o (20m Window approximately West) showing only Gladiator drilling and recently returned assay results along the interpreted granodiorite-skarn boundary.

Drilling highlighted the economic potential of complimentary co-products to copper mineralization including molybdenum (up to 1,482 ppm), gold (up to 0.35 g/t), and silver (up to 18.17 g/t). Select drilling intercepts returned: 8m @ 1.48% Cu from 87m ( 0.23 g/t Au, 8.5 g/t Ag & 1,347ppm Mo ) within 52m @ 0.74% Cu from 77m (0.09 g/t Au, 4.07 g/t Ag & 473 ppm Mo) - CPG-031 30m @ 1.48% Cu from 56m (0.21 g/t Au, 8.39 g/t Ag & 1,308ppm Mo) within 48m @ 1.08% Cu from 38m (0.15 g/t Au, 6.18 g/t Ag & 951ppm Mo) - CPG-032. 109.77m @ 0.77% Cu from 4.23m (0.07 g/t Au, 3.92 g/t Ag & 369ppm Mo), Including 8m @ 2.57% Cu from 8m (0.30 g/t Au, 18.17 g/t Ag & 1,482ppm Mo ) and 14m @ 1.31 % Cu from 72m and 4m @ 1.36% Cu from 108m (0.06 g/t Au, 4.8 g/t Ag & 919ppm Mo) - CPG-035 Figure 3: Section (Line 2) through the Cowley Park prospect looking 280 o (20m Window approximately West) showing only Gladiator drilling and recently returned assay results along the interpreted granodiorite-skarn boundary.

Hole CPG-049 (drilled as a twin of 19-CP-04) was designed to test for significant high-grade mineralization that was truncated by historic hole \"19-CP-04\". This historic hole was, subsequently interpreted to be inconsistent in terms of its mineralization and geology when compared to the surrounding holes and is now believed to be not correctly located (collar data incorrect). Drilling completed on Section Line 3 (see Figure 4), intersected significant high-grade mineralization over broad widths in CPG-045, CPG-047 and CPG-049 supporting mineralization continuing for at least 220 metres from near surface down dip whilst remaining open at depth, to the west and towards the East (18-CP-04 and 19-CP-08), significant results include: 98m @ 1.49% Cu from 103m (0.04 g/t Au, 3.68 g/t Ag & 187 ppm Mo) including 20m @ 5.53% Cu from 145m (0.07 g/t Au, 11.47 g/t Ag & 229 ppm Mo), or 14m @ 7.67% Cu from 145m (0.07 g/t Au, 15.16 g/t Ag & 217 ppm Mo)- CPG-047 79m @ 1.37% Cu from 71m (0.06 g/t Au, 4.38 g/t Ag & 261 ppm Mo) including 26m @ 3.31% Cu from 88m (0.06 g/t Au, 8.97 g/t Ag & 44 ppm Mo) - CPG-049 38m @ 1.01% Cu from 96m (0.06 g/t Au, 4.83 g/t Ag & 604 ppm Mo) including 12m @ 1.73% Cu from 96m (0.10 g/t Au, 7.75 g/t Ag & 1,052 ppm Mo) & 4m @ 2.50% Cu from 122 m (0.10 g/t Au, 11.15 g/t Ag & 1,051 ppm Mo) - CPG-045 20m @ 1.22% Cu from 118m (0.03 g/t Au, 5.29 g/t Ag & 317ppm Mo) within 52m @ 0.73% Cu from 88m (0.04 g/t Au, 4.56 g/t Ag & 255ppm Mo) - CPG-051 Hole CPG-018 (drilled by Gladiator in 2023) intersected minor skarn mineralization over the last 1.6m of the hole (200.1 to 202.69m EOH). With the results of CPG-047, mineralization is now interpreted to remain open at depth, and Gladiator plans to further test the down dip potential of this zone by extending CPG-018 upon the restart of drilling in January 2025. A further 5 holes (CPG-037, 039 & 042-044) were drilled to the west of Section Line 3 to further test historic drilling, drilling returned: 36m @ 1.23% Cu from 49m (0.22 g/t Au, 7.53 g/t Ag & 494 ppm Mo), Including 6m @ 1.53% Cu from 61m (1.02 g/t Au, 13.10 g/t Ag & 262 ppm Mo) - CPG-039 24m @ 1.05% Cu from 84m (0.07 g/t Au, 7.02 g/t Ag & 978 ppm Mo) within 32m @ 0.90% Cu from 82m (0.06 g/t Au, 6.02 g/t Ag & 942 ppm Mo) - CPG-037 14m @ 0.57% Cu from 55m (0.03 g/t Au, 5.46 g/t Ag & 22 ppm Mo) and 4m @ 0.52% Cu from 9m (0.03 g/t Au, 4.60 g/t Ag & 1,011 ppm Mo) - CPG-042 These holes confirm Gladiator's belief that copper mineralization including molybdenum, gold and silver at Cowley Park is near surface, is high-grade and remains open along strike and down dip in all directions, meaning significant opportunities exists to expand the potential of Cowley to host a significant resource both within AND outside the area of historic drilling. Figure 4 Section (Line 3) through the Cowley Park prospect looking 280 o (20m Window approximately West) showing only Gladiator drilling and recently returned assay results along the interpreted granodiorite-skarn boundary.

Optimal targeted drilling was not achieved during this drill period, however broad intervals of mineralization were intersected east of what is believed to be part of the predicted eastern extents of the main mineralized area. Mineralisation remains open to the east with significant intercepts including: 36m @ 0.58% Cu from 117m (0.07 g/t Au, 4.03 g/t Ag & 263 ppm Mo) - CPG-056 50m @ 0.47% Cu from 60m (0.07 g/t Au, 3.31 g/t Ag & 385 ppm Mo) - CPG-058 See Figure 1: Plan map of Cowley Park over LIDAR DTM for the drill collar locations Exploration Drilling In addition to the four Section Lines completed by Gladiator, a further 9 holes were completed to test exploration upside within and external to the known mineralized system. Three holes (CPG-033, 062 & 063) were completed to the east (~350m East of Section Line 3) of the known mineralized system returning encouraging results, including: 22m @ 1.02% Cu from 117m (0.10 g/t Au, 11.25 g/t Ag & 319ppm Mo) within 38m @ 0.84% Cu from 109m (0.08 g/t Au, 8.03 g/t Ag & 253 ppm Mo) - CPG-033 10m @ 1.04% Cu from 103m (0.22 g/t Au, 8.48 g/t Ag & 1,955 ppm Mo) within 50m @ 0.54% Cu from 67m (0.07 g/t Au, 4.02 g/t Ag & 557 ppm Mo) - CPG-062 A further hole (CPG-064) was drilled to test a geophysical target south of the known mineralized system, the hole whilst intersecting minor skarn mineralization, returned no significant assays. Processing of Historic Core Gladiator is nearing completion of the processing of the available historic drill core for Cowley Park that was inherited on acquisition of the project. The historic core has continued to deliver potential upside, returning significant intercepts including: 23.04m @ 1.59% Cu from 74.98m (0.15 g/t Au, 10.28 g/t Ag & 460 ppm Mo) plus 4.88m @ 3.45% Cu from 81.38m (0.30 g/t Au, 25.45 g/t Ag & 949ppm Mo) & 4.75m @ 1.91% Cu from 93.27m (0.15 g/t Au, 7.6 g/t Ag & 594 ppm Mo) within 31.09m @ 1.27% Cu from 71.02m (0.12 g/t Au, 8.34 g/t Ag & 374 ppm Mo) - 18-CP-06 13.30m @ 2.10% Cu from 48.70m (0.08 g/t Au, 12.06 g/t Ag & 761 ppm Mo) including 8.00m @ 3.02% Cu from 50m (0.11 g/t Au, 18.30 g/t Ag & 981 ppm Mo) - CP-142 40.20m @ 1.74% Cu from 32.30m (0.11 g/t Au, 7.57 g/t Ag & 515 ppm Mo) - CP-144 The confirmation of co-product credits, historically never assayed for, offers an opportunity to significantly enhance the economic potential of the deposit.

Note that the quoted Intersections are not true width. QA / QC Drilling completed by Gladiator is irregularly spaced to test parts of the mineralized systems, holes were directionally surveyed utilising a North Seeking Gyro direction tool. Drill collars are subsequently surveyed utilising a high-accuracy RTK DGPS or DeviSite system. Upon drilling of diamond core, Gladiator undertakes geological logging, marking up of lineal length of the core, recording core recovery, and Geotech measurements such as RQD's and taking core photographs. Based on the geological logging, core is then marked up for sampling with a new sampling ticket that matches the submitted sample for analysis at the start of the sample interval, the drill core is then cut in half utilizing a core saw equipped with a diamond saw blade. The core samples are then sent for analysis and the remaining half core retained for future reference. Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) or known blank material is placed within the sampling sequence at a nominal sampling rate of at least 1 in 25 samples to monitor the Laboratory. Samples are submitted to the ALS Global laboratory (Canada). As part of the processing and capturing of previously unassayed drill core, Gladiator is undertaking a systematic review of the available drill core after being retrieved from storage. This includes a review of the geological logging, marking up of lineal length of the core, undertaking a comparison of the physical ticketed sampling against historic documentation where noted, remarking any notations on the core box (including hole number, box number and nominal depths) and taking core photographs. After the systematic review, if the core is required to be sampled or resampled where it is deemed to not match the historical record of the hole, it is then marked up for sampling with a new sampling ticket that matches the submitted sample for analysis at the start of the sample interval, the drill core is then cut in half (for un-cut core) or quartered (for resampled core where required) utilizing a core saw equipped with a diamond saw blade. The core samples are then sent for analysis and the remaining half (or quarter core) retained for future reference. Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) or known blank material is placed within the sampling sequence at a nominal sampling rate of 1 in 25 samples to monitor the laboratory. Samples are submitted to the ALS Global laboratory (Canada). Samples subject to this release were crushed to 70% less than 2mm before pulverizing to better than 85% passing 75 microns. Samples were then analysed by ALS method ME-ICP61 (Aqua Regia with ICP-MS finish), with over limits for Cu analysed by method CU-OG62 (Aqua Regia with ICP-MS finish). As part of this process, Gladiator also captures the required sampling metadata to potentially utilize the core and analysis for any future requirements if deemed acceptable. The QA/QC meets the current required standards under reporting instruments, such as NI-43-101. At this point, Gladiator regards the data collected from this exercise as reliable for the purposes of identifying future exploration targets and may be used to inform future drilling and exploration campaigns. As part of this process, Gladiator also captures the required sampling metadata to potentially utilize the core and analysis for any future requirements if deemed acceptable. Further drilling will need to be completed by Gladiator at some stage to confirm the reliability or usability of this data in the future including but not limited to twinning of reported mineralization. This may be required as Gladiator may not be able to confirm the accuracy of the stated drill collar location or be able to re-enter the holes to confirm depths and undertake directional surveys, or that the QA/QC might not meet the current required standards under reporting instruments, such as NI-43-101. At this point the Company is treating the data collected from this exercise as reliable for the purposes of identifying future exploration targets and may be used to inform future drilling and exploration campaigns. In reference to historic drill results reported in this news release from the Company's data compilation exercise, these results are historical in nature. Gladiator has not undertaken any independent investigation, nor has it independently analyzed the results of the historical exploration work in order to verify the results. The Company believes that the historical drill results currently do not conform to presently accepted industry standards. Gladiator considers these historical drill results relevant as the Company will use this data as a guide to plan future exploration and drilling programs. The Company also considers the data to be reliable for these purposes, however, the Company's future exploration work will include verification of the data through drilling. Please refer to the Company's previous news releases regarding Cowley Park for further details. In reference to Drill Hole 19-CP-04, Gladiator considers this hole to be inconsistent with the surrounding holes and will not be utilised by the Company, unless further validation of the hole is possible.

Skyrocketing . In this article, we are going to take a look at where DT Midstream, Inc. (NYSE: DTM ) stands against other energy infrastructure stocks that are skyrocketing. In January 2024, the Biden administration paused federal authorizations for several pending LNG export projects, citing concerns about environmental impacts and domestic energy security. The US Department of Energy later released an assessment indicating that increased LNG exports could add 1.5 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions annually by 2050, equivalent to a quarter of the current emissions of the US. However, President-elect Donald Trump is set to reverse the Biden administration\u2019s pause on liquefied natural gas (LNG) export approvals, marking a significant shift in US energy policy. On January 1, Ukraine officially halted the transit of Russian natural gas to several European nations, marking the end of a five-year agreement and closing a chapter in Russia\u2019s decades-long dominance over Europe\u2019s energy markets. The termination of this deal comes amidst the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia, with neither side willing to negotiate an extension. Europe is expected to rely heavily on liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports. Christoph Halser of Rystad Energy estimates that the EU will need to source approximately 7.2 billion cubic meters of gas from the global LNG market.

As Europe pivots away from Russian gas, the United States emerges as a key player in filling the supply gap. US LNG exports to Europe have already been rising in recent years, and this shift presents an even greater opportunity for American energy producers. With robust infrastructure and increased LNG export capacity, the U.S. is well-positioned to strengthen its role as a reliable supplier to Europe, enhancing energy security across the continent while bolstering its own energy industry. The growth of US energy exports hinges on significant investments in infrastructure. According to a report by ICF, prepared for the American Petroleum Institute (API), the development of US oil and gas infrastructure is expected to remain robust through 2035. The report highlights that the primary drivers for continued infrastructure development remain strong. Shale and tight oil resource extraction are projected to continue at a rapid pace, supported by advancements in extraction technologies and favorable market responses to competitive commodity prices. Total capital expenditures (CAPEX) for oil and gas infrastructure are projected to range between $1.06 trillion and $1.34 trillion from 2017 to 2035. This equates to an average annual investment of $56 billion to $71 billion, spanning various infrastructure components, including surface and lease equipment, gathering and processing facilities, pipelines for oil, gas, and natural gas liquids (NGLs), storage facilities, refineries, and export terminals. Story Continues As global energy dynamics shift, the United States stands poised to play a pivotal role in ensuring energy security for Europe while driving growth in its own energy sector.

Operations With Three Bolt-on Acquisitions Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 8, 2025, 2:55 PM 4 min read In This Article: PAA +0.51% Plains All American Pipeline PAA announced three bolt-on acquisitions for an aggregate cash consideration of nearly $670 million, the purchase of nearly 18% of its outstanding PAA Series A Preferred Units and a 20% increase in its annualized distribution rate. The firm\u2019s board of directors has approved an increase in its quarterly distribution (payable in February 2025), for both PAA common units and Plains Group PAGP Class A shares, from 31.75 cents per unit to 38 cents. On an annualized basis, the distribution represents an increase of 25 cents per unit, or 20%, from that paid in November 2024. Details of PAA\u2019s Three Bolt-on Acquisitions Plains All American agreed to buy Ironwood Midstream Energy (for nearly $475 million), which owns a gathering system in the Eagle Ford Basin, from EnCap Flatrock Midstream. The transaction is expected to be closed in the first quarter of 2025, following the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. As of Jan. 1, 2025, Medallion Midstream's Delaware Basin crude oil collecting business was purchased from The Energy & Minerals Group by Plains Oryx Permian Basin LLC, a subsidiary of the Plains Permian Basin joint venture, for about $160 million ($105 million net to PAA's interest). On Dec. 23, 2024, a subsidiary of Plains All American acquired the remaining 50% interest in Midway Pipeline LLC from a subsidiary of CVR Energy for approximately $90 million. Benefits From Acquisitions The above-mentioned bolt-on acquisitions are an outstanding strategic fit for the firm and allow it to progress its efficient growth strategy by adding high-quality assets adjacent to its existing footprint. These transactions should expand PAA's crude oil footprint in the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford and Mid-Con at returns consistent with its additional investment framework. In particular, these transactions create immediate value by accelerating sustainable additions to profits, addition to distributable cash flow and accelerating return of capital to unitholders. During third-quarter 2024, the firm\u2019s crude oil segment\u2019s adjusted EBITDA increased 4% year over year. This was primarily due to higher tariff volumes on its pipelines, tariff escalations and contributions from acquisitions. In 2023, the firm high-graded its asset base through continued portfolio optimization, including three bolt-on acquisitions. In 2024, PAA acquired an additional 0.7% interest in the Wink to Webster Pipeline Company for an aggregate cash consideration of $20 million. It expects $300 million of free cash flow after cash distributions to be available for value-creating opportunities in 2024, including potential bolt-on acquisitions or further debt reduction. The firm\u2019s numerous joint ventures, partnerships and joint ownership agreements provide it with robust opportunities. Story Continues PAA\u2019s Initiative to Optimize Capital Structure Plains All American has also agreed to purchase approximately 12.7 million units, or 18%, of its outstanding Series A Preferred Units at par ($26.25) for a purchase price of nearly $330 million (plus accrued and unpaid distributions) from EnCap Flatrock Midstream. This transaction is expected to be closed in late January 2025. After implementing all these transactions, Plains All American\u2019s leverage ratio is expected to be at or below the lower end of its target range of 3.25x to 3.75x, continuing to provide significant balance sheet optionality and flexibility. PAA\u2019s Price Performance In the past month, units of PAA have lost 1.5% compared with the industry\u2019s 0.1% decline.

{"text": "The Valerion VisionMaster Max ascends the projector brand from Kickstarter to CES 2025 Derek Malcolm Wed, Jan 8, 2025, 2:16 AM 4 min read It\u2019s not easy to stand out on the projector battleground of lumens, contrast ratios, and HDR specs that is the global projector landscape. But one company, Valerion, last year managed to make headlines with a Kickstarter campaign that saw the sister company to AWOL Vision raise a record $10 million in funding for its VisionMaster series of projectors. Now, making a huge leap from crowd-funding to the hallowed halls of CES 2025 , the Shenzhen-based company is using the Las Vegas tech event to announce its most advanced projector to date: the Valerion VisionMaster Max, a $4,000 triple laser projector that is currently available for preorder . Digital Trends received compensation for considering coverage of these products. The brand had no input on the editorial content and did not influence the coverage. Adding to its already robust lineup of VisionMaster projectors that includes the $3,000 Pro2 and Pro models and $2,000 Plus2 and Plus models , the Valerion VisionMaster Max trumps them all with 3,000 ISO lumens of brightness beamed from its RGB triple laser light source that can project an image from 40 inches to a massive 300 inches. Anyone who\u2019s familiar with projectors will tell you that one of the biggest challenges is finding one with the brightness and contrast to adapt and perform well in a variety of room-lighting situations \u2014 we all can\u2019t have perfectly dark, dedicated home theater dens. Projector tech has been getting better in that area lately, and the VisionMaster Max is proof positive. John Higgins / Digital Trends With an impressive 15,000:1 contrast ratio \u2014 which, for the uninitiated, contrast ratio is the difference between the brightest whites and the darkest blacks on the screen \u2014 the Max should do well in moderately bright rooms. The Max also features an Enhanced Black Level mode that Valerion says \u201cenhances the depth and richness of black tones, ensuring that both the brightest highlights and the darkest shadows are more vivid and lifelike,\u201d which, in my experience with other projectors with a similar feature, such as the AWOL Vision LTV-3500 Pro , means improved contrast performance in rooms with more ambient light. Additionally, the VisionMaster Max feature Dynamic Tone Mapping (DTM) automatically adjusting brightness and contrast in HDR content in real time, preventing highlights from washing out while maintaining sharp shadow and dark details as well as color. OK, so it\u2019s got some specs in the contrast department, but what about color? All of the Valerion VisionMaster projectors feature a 110% coverage of the BT.2020 (REC.2020) color standard, making sure that (ideally) what you\u2019re seeing on screen is what the director or filmmakers wanted you to see. But even if you like to go your own way and prefer to tweak it to suit you, then there are customization options to dial it in, too. Story Continues Valerion Under the hood of the Max is Valerion\u2019s AI-SoC Platform, MT9618 processor that does a lot of the heavy lifting, including AI-driven FHD to 4K upscaling with something Valerion calls AI-Super Resolution. The Max features picture modes aplenty, including IMAX Enhanced mode, Filmmaker mode, and support for Dolby Vision, HDR10+ HDR, and Active 3D. Gamers will also be in luck for gaming with a speedy 4ms input lag and 1080p gaming at 240Hz, with custom modes for RPG, SPG, FPS, and more. While the VisionMaster Max feature a pair of 12-watt speakers, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll need to add a soundbar for better sound. However, when you do, there\u2019s a nice spread of audio support that includes not just Dolby Atmos and DTS but also virtual sound effects standards including Dolby DAP and DTS: Virtual X. Valerion If setting up a projector is a daunting idea (because it is), then the Max might ease your mind. While it\u2019s not an ultra short throw projector that requires only inches from the screen to setup, the short-to-medium throw Max needs just feet, and it has an optical zoom adjustment feature so you don\u2019t have to rely on moving the projector around to fit an image. Additionally, there\u2019s also vertical and horizontal lens shifting for more precise image adjustment, too. Love it or hate it, the Valerion VisionMaster Max runs on Google TV OS that\u2019s built in, granting access to all the most popular streaming services and apps you need like Netflix, Max, Hulu, Apple TV+, and more. But if you prefer to run your own streaming device , like an Apple TV 4K or Roku, then you can connect via one of three HDMI inputs (2 x HDMI 2.1, 1 x HDMI 2.0 (eARC). The Max also features two USB ports (1 x USB 3.0, 1 x USB 2.0), two digital audio outs, Bluetooth 5.2, and Wi-Fi 6e. But like a lot of TVs on the market now, projectors can also act as a hub for the home. The VisionMaster Max supports smart connectivity with AirPlay 2, Chromecast, and Miracast wireless streaming, as well as Google Home, Apple HomeKit, Amazon\u2019s Alex, and Control 4 for a wide range of integrations with your smart devices. The Valerion VisionMaster Max can be preordered now at the Valerion website for $4,000 View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard Recommended Stories", "symbol": "DTM", "date":
