[{"text": "Thiogenesis Receives Final EU Clearance of CTA to Initiate its Phase 2 Clinical Trial in MELAS Newsfile Corp. Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 5:00 PM 6 min read In This Article: TTIPF 0.00% San Diego, California--(Newsfile Corp. - January 27, 2025) - Thiogenesis Therapeutics, and Corp. (TSXV: TTI) (\"Thiogenesis\" or the \"Company\") , a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing disulfides that drive the production of critically important intracellular antioxidants and other therapeutic compounds, today announced that the European Medicines Agency (\"EMA\") has accepted its Clinical Trial Application (\"CTA\") Part II - National and Patient Level Documentation , for Thiogenesis' lead compound TTI-0102. It is the final regulatory clearance required for Thiogenesis to commence its Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (\"MELAS\"). The Company previously announced that its CTA Part I - Scientific and Medicinal Product Documentation , had been accepted by EMA. Thiogenesis anticipates initiating the Phase 2 clinical trial in MELAS shortly, subject to the activation of the clinical trial sites. The Phase 2 MELAS clinical trial is a multi-country, multi-center trial that will be conducted at leading institutions in France and the Netherlands. The trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics / pharmacodynamics and efficacy of oral TTI-0102 for the treatment of patients with MELAS over a 6-month period. The trial will enroll a total of 12 patients, 8 patients will receive TTI-0102, and 4 patients will receive placebo. There will be an interim analysis of safety data, pharmacokinetics / pharmacodynamics and biomarkers (cysteamine, glutathione, taurine etc.) after 3 months. In addition to assessing several significant biomarkers, the efficacy endpoints for the clinical trial are: 12-Minute Walking Test (\"12-MWT\") Fatigue Severity Scale (\"FSS\") Quality of Life Assessment (\"WHOQOL-BREF\") \"We are thrilled to be nearing the dosing of a patient with MELAS,\" said Patrice Rioux, MD, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Thiogenesis. \"As a well-tolerated precursor to cysteamine, TTI-0102 is engineered to intracellularly increase the antioxidant glutathione and the amino acid taurine, both of which are well understood to be deficient in MELAS patients. As a result, TTI-0102 has the potential to be a viable therapeutic compound for the treatment of MELAS, for which there is no currently approved drugs.\" About MELAS Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (\"MELAS\") is a rare, inherited mitochondrial disorder, most often caused by a mutation of m.3243A>G in the MT-TL1 gene in mitochondrial DNA. Initial symptoms usually include seizures, vomiting, headaches, muscle weakness, loss of appetite and fatigue. Longer term the disease may cause a loss of motor skills and intellectual disability. MELAS usually presents itself before the age of 20. Oxidative stress and taurine deficiency play an important role in mitochondria and are potential pathological mechanisms of mitochondrial disorders, making for viable targets for the treatment of MELAS and other mitochondrial diseases. MELAS is an orphan disease, there are estimated to be approximately 4.4/100,000 patients with MELAS relative to the population (Chakrabarty S, et al.2020). Story Continues About TTI-0102 Thiogenesis' lead compound, TTI-0102, is an asymmetric disulfide and a prodrug that acts as a precursor to the thiol compound cysteamine. Thiols, which have a functional SH group (containing sulfur and hydrogen), are versatile bio-active molecules that are known to be involved in key biochemical reactions and metabolic processes, making them promising candidates for several therapeutic applications. Thiols are known to be precursors to important antioxidants such as glutathione and amino acids like taurine, providing the potential to restore mitochondrial function. The prodrug TTI-0102 was developed to address the challenges of first-generation thiol-based drugs, including their short half live, adverse side effects and dosing limitations. About Thiogenesis Thiogenesis Therapeutics, Corp. (TSXV: TTI) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company operating through its wholly owned subsidiary based in San Diego, CA. The Company is publicly traded on the TSX Venture Exchange. Thiogenesis is developing sulfur-containing prodrugs that act as precursors to previously approved thiol-active compounds, with the potential to treat serious pediatric diseases with unmet medical needs. Prodrugs are drugs that contain previously approved active ingredients and are modified so that they only become active when metabolized. For regulatory purposes prodrugs can use existing third-party safety data in regulatory submissions in the streamlined 505 (b)(2) regulatory pathway in the US, and its equivalent hybrid system in Europe, to proceed into human efficacy trials with regulatory clearance. Prodrugs may enhance the profile of the active ingredient to increase its bioavailability and reduce side effects. The Company's initial target indications include Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis and Stroke (\"MELAS\"), Leigh's syndrome, Rett syndrome and pediatric MASH.

Analysis, Industry Trends & Growth Forecasts to 2030, with Major Player Profiles for ams-OSRAM, Ledvance, Panasonic, Signify and Thorn Lighting Research and Markets Mon, Jan 20, 2025, 2:05 PM 7 min read Company Logo Dublin, Jan. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Europe Outdoor LED Lighting - Market Share Analysis, Industry Trends & Statistics, Growth Forecasts (2024 - 2030)\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The European Outdoor LED Lighting Market size was estimated at 2.44 billion USD in 2024, and is expected to reach 3.41 billion USD by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 5.70% during the forecast period 2024-2030. Increasing use of LED lighting in amusement parks and parking lots and government regulations to ban traditional lamps will drive the growth of the LED lighting market In terms of value and volume, public spaces accounted for the largest share in 2023, followed by roads and trails. With the emergence of retail outlets in the area, the demand for parking has increased. For example, IKEA bought the former Topshop flagship store on Oxford Street for GBP 378 million. IKEA opened its first store in the same building in 2023, specializing in household items such as lamps and curtains. Such instances in the market are expected to lead to increased demand for LED retail lighting products in the region. These developments will increase the number of public spaces, such as private parking spaces, and the use of LED lighting. A major factor driving the demand for LED products in Europe is the European Union's policy of banning the sale of inefficient lighting technologies. In 2009, Europe phased out the use of incandescent light bulbs. Directional halogen lamps were also discontinued in 2016. In September 2018, the region banned the sale of non-directional halogen lamps. These policies have facilitated the gradual replacement of traditional lighting products by consumers with those based on LED technology. Upgradation and renovation of stadiums, rising rail infrastructure, and use of street lights to drive the growth of the LED lighting market In terms of value and volume, the Rest of Europe occupied a major share in 2023, followed by the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. The market share is expected to be a small reduction in the Rest of Europe and gain in other remaining countries in coming years. Countries such as Spain, Barcelona, and Valencia are working to develop new stadiums and refurbish historical buildings in their countries. For example, Barcelona secured EUR 1.45 billion (USD 1.6 billion) from multiple investors for the construction of its Camp Nou stadium. Brussels planned to invest EUR 6 million (USD 6.5 million) in 2022. EuroBasket 2025 and other events are some of the upcoming sporting events in Europe. Therefore, the renovation and construction of new stadiums and the increase in sports tournaments are expected to boost sales of LED lighting in the country. The smart building initiatives and falling average LED prices are also key drivers of LED demand. LEDs for building and street lighting have already been tested in German cities. On average, most European countries spend about 0.8% to 1.2% of their annual GDP on road networks. For example, in 2015, Austria implemented a program of investment in the Austrian motorway network. Story Continues Europe Outdoor LED Lighting Market Trends Upgradation, replacement, and construction of new stadiums will drive the growth of LED lights The number of stadiums is expected to witness growth from 1,700 units in 2022 to 1,760 units in 2029, exhibiting a CAGR of 0.5%. The sports sector has undergone several changes in recent years. For instance, London Stadium and Musco collaborated in 2020 to upgrade the lighting system and install LED lights. The Aviva Stadium in Dublin had spectacular lighting effects by 2020. Red, green, blue, and white (RGBW) LED fixtures with 52 color-changing options make up the recently installed system. The stadium at Ciutat de Valencia underwent renovation in 2020, and LED floodlights were added. Six stadiums in Europe got new lighting by Signify in 2021. These elements support the expansion of the LED market in the area. European clubs set aside more than EUR 2.5 billion (USD 2.69 billion) for facility renovations. Valencia, Spain, which committed EUR 300 million (USD 323.77 million) to constructing the Nou Mestalla stadium in 2022, made the second-most expensive investment. With UEFA's assistance, the Football Association of Serbia (FSS) invested more than EUR 20 million (USD 21.58 million) in 2023 to upgrade a number of the nation's stadiums. Barcelona obtained EUR 1.45 billion (USD 1.6 billion) in financing from several investors to start building the Camp Nou stadium in 2023. Brussels invested EUR 6 million (USD 6.47 million) in building a major stadium in 2022. The renovation and construction of new stadiums and an increase in sporting tournaments are expected to increase sales of LED lights in the country. Increasing residential housing and non-residential buildings may drive the growth of LED lights In 2022, Europe had 743.5 million people. The Member States of the European Union contains over 131 million structures. The European Union has 119 million residential buildings and 12 million non-residential buildings. In 2022, the demand for housing remained high, encouraging the building of new homes in the region, thus benefitting the local LED market. There were 197.4 million households in 2021 as opposed to 196.0 million in 2020. In the EU, 49.4% of households had a single child in 2021, followed by 38.6% with two children and 12% with three or more. About 70% of EU citizens were homeowners in 2020. In 2019, European homes had 1.6 rooms per person on average. The use of LEDs in homes and business spaces may increase as the population and the number of households rise. As of 2019, there were 242.7 million cars on the road in the European Union, an increase of 1.8% from the previous year, and more than 28 million vans on the road. France has by far the largest fleet of vans, with six million vehicles, followed by Italy (4.2 million), Spain (3.8 million), and Germany (2.8 million). EU roadways have 6.2 million medium and heavy commercial vehicles. Even though registrations have gone up recently, only 4.6% of all EU vehicles are alternatively powered. Hybrid electric vehicles make up 0.8% of all vehicles on EU roads, while battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles each account for only 0.2% of the total. The increase in automotive vehicle sales may positively impact LED sales in the region.

first Air Traffic Services Training Centre in collaboration with NAV CANADA CNW Group Thu, Jan 16, 2025, 7:55 PM 4 min read In This Article: CAE -2.16% The recently opened training centre on CAE's campus in Montreal marks a broadening of CAE's training portfolio MONTREAL , Jan. 16, 2025 /CNW/ - (NYSE: CAE) (TSX: CAE) \u2013 Today, global aviation training leader CAE has inaugurated its first Air Traffic Services (ATS) Training Centre, on its campus in Montreal, Canada . As the largest provider of civil aviation training worldwide, CAE trains pilots, aircraft maintenance technicians, and cabin crew. Last October, CAE started partnering in the training of air traffic controllers (ATC) and flight service specialists (FSS) with NAV CANADA . \"We are thrilled to officially inaugurate CAE's first ATS training centre in collaboration with NAV CANADA . As an innovator in aviation learning sciences, CAE is perfectly positioned to partner with NAV CANADA and other Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSP) to meet the increasing global demand for air traffic services personnel and train the highly skilled professionals they need to manage air traffic safely,\" said CAE President and CEO Marc Parent . \"This is an extension of CAE's core mission to make the world safer, and as a pilot, I can attest to the critical importance of the communication between flight crew and the air traffic personnel who play an essential role in the safety of every flight.\" \"Air travel is a cornerstone of Canada's social and economic vitality, with NAV CANADA positioned at the crossroads of international traffic, connecting communities and businesses globally,\" said Mark Cooper , President and CEO of NAV CANADA . \"This partnership with CAE exemplifies our dedication to operational excellence, ensuring safe and efficient air navigation while preparing for the future of aviation through innovative training and collaboration.\" CAE's first partnership in the air traffic services sector is with the world's first fully private ANSP, and second largest in terms of the size of its airspace, NAV CANADA . The first students began their training at the new facility in October 2024 , with CAE aiming to train approximately 500 air traffic professionals by 2028. CAE's instructors deliver initial training for air traffic controllers and flight service specialists to students coming from across Canada using NAV CANADA's training curriculum and courseware. NAV CANADA will continue to deliver basic training, all specialty courses, and on-the-job training, with the latter part of Air Traffic Services training solely offered by NAV CANADA . \"We are very proud of this first partnership with NAV CANADA and are excited to help them train more air traffic controllers and flight service specialists over the coming three years,\" said Marie-Christine Cloutier , Vice President - Strategy, Performance & Marketing at CAE and Head of CAE's new Air Traffic Services (ATS) division. \"As ANSPs accelerate their airspace modernization efforts, it is critical that equal emphasis is placed on training innovation to prepare the next generation of air traffic personnel. CAE's turn-key expertise in competency-based training design, advanced instructional delivery, and data-driven technologies can support ANSPs in this transformation.\" Story Continues CAE has extensive experience and a strong understanding of global regulatory requirements, enabling the expansion of Approved Training Organizations across various authorities.

Avisekh  Bhattacharjee Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 6:03 PM 5 min read In This Article: MMM -1.42% 3M Company MMM is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2024 results on Jan. 21, before market open. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently pegged at $1.66 per share on revenues of $5.79 billion. Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar . Fourth-quarter earnings estimates have been revised upward by a penny over the past seven days. However, the bottom-line projection indicates a decrease of 31.4% from the year-ago number. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues indicates a year-over-year decline of 27.7%. For the current year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 3M\u2019s revenues is pegged at $23.6 billion, implying a decline of 27.8% year over year. Also, the consensus mark for current-year earnings per share is pegged at $7.28, implying a decrease of 21.2% on a year-over-year basis. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research It is worth noting that in April 2024, 3M completed the spin-off of its Health Care business into a separate public company. Notably, the spin-off is likely to have weighed on MMM\u2019s year-over-year top-line comparison in the quarter. Earnings Surprise History 3M has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company\u2019s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 9.6%. In the last reported quarter, it delivered an earnings surprise of 2.6%. 3M Company Price and EPS Surprise 3M Company Price and EPS Surprise 3M Company price-eps-surprise | 3M Company Quote Earnings Whispers for MMM Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for the company this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, but that\u2019s not the case here. MMM has an Earnings ESP of +0.72% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can uncover the best stocks before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here . What\u2019s Likely to Shape 3M\u2019s Q4 Results? Weakness in the consumer retail end markets, owing to lower consumer retail discretionary spending on hardline goods, is expected to have hurt the Consumer segment\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter. There has been particular weakness in the packaging & expression, home & auto care and consumer safety and well-being businesses. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter revenues from the Consumer segment is pegged at $1.2 billion, indicating a decline of 4.8% sequentially. The Safety and Industrial segment is expected to have put up a weak show in the upcoming earnings due to softness across the industrial specialties, abrasives and automotive aftermarket businesses. However, strength in roofing granules and electrical markets is likely to have augmented its sales. The consensus estimate for the segment\u2019s revenues is pegged at $2.7 billion, indicating a 3.4% decrease from the previous quarter\u2019s number. High debt level and interest expenses remain another concern for the company. Exiting the third quarter of 2024, 3M\u2019s long-term debt was high at $11.3 billion. Also, interest expenses in the first nine months of 2024 increased 64.5% year over year to $939 million. Exiting the third quarter, its short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt totaled $1.9 billion. Higher interest expenses are likely to have proven detrimental to its profitability in the to-be-reported quarter. 3M\u2019s international presence keeps it exposed to the risk of adverse currency fluctuations. This is because a strengthening U.S. dollar requires the company to either raise prices or contract profit margins in locations outside the United States. For instance, adverse foreign currency translation lowered the company\u2019s sales by 0.3% year over year in the third quarter of 2024. Nevertheless, strength in the commercial branding and transportation end markets is expected to have driven the Transportation and Electronics segment\u2019s performance. Solid electronics demand, backed by an increase in production volume, by electronics original equipment manufacturer customers bodes well. The consensus estimate for the Transportation and Electronics segment\u2019s revenues is pegged at $1.8 billion. Story Continues Price Performance & Valuation MMM shares have gained 3% in the past three months against the Zacks Diversified Operations industry\u2019s 11% decline. The conglomerate giant\u2019s shares have also outperformed the S&P 500\u2019s growth of 2.5%. The company\u2019s peers Honeywell International Inc. HON, Federal Signal Corporation FSS and Griffon Corporation GFF have gained 0.3%, 10.3% and 12%, respectively, in the same period. MMM\u2019s Three-Month Price Performance Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research In terms of valuation, MMM\u2019s forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) is 17.70X, a premium to its five-year median of 15.05X and industry average of 15.16X. This indicates that investors will be paying a higher price than the company's expected earnings growth compared with its peers. Price-to-Earnings (Forward 12 Months) Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research How Should You Play 3M Pre-Q4 Earnings? 3M's robust and diversified portfolio, encompassing industrial abrasives, automotive components, electrical products and packaging materials, along with strength in the Transportation and Electronics segment, seems promising for its long-term growth. However, weakness in the Safety and Industrial segment, along with tepid demand in the consumer retail end markets, has been concerning for its near-term performance. Also, a high debt level and expensive valuation warrant a cautious approach for existing investors. Potential investors should consider waiting for MMM\u2019s earnings report and clearer signs of recovery before investing in the stock. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

SAN ANTONIO, January 13, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- bioAffinity Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIAF; BIAFW), a biotechnology company focused on the need for noninvasive tests for the detection of early-stage cancer and lung disease, today reported the results of the Company\u2019s CyPath \u00ae Lung pilot marketing program using Texas for our beta launch with sales of more than 600 tests delivered in 2024. \"We are extremely pleased with the exponential growth and our 2024 achievements in delivering a quality diagnostic that makes a difference in patient care. We already see more and more physicians and pulmonary practices incorporating CyPath \u00ae Lung into their practices, and we are excited that this year we will launch sales to Veteran and military medical systems,\" bioAffinity Technologies President and CEO Maria Zannes said. \"The sales growth we saw quarter-over-quarter in 2024 is continuing in 2025 and is supported by the addition of CyPath \u00ae Lung to the U.S. Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), making the test available to Veterans and active military across the U.S. government health systems.\" Ms. Zannes was recently featured on Nasdaq\u2019s Amplify Spotlight , a series focused on leaders in the small-cap community, where she explained the unique attributes of CyPath \u00ae Lung and the strategy for expanding its position in the lung cancer diagnostics market. CyPath \u00ae Lung has shown 92% sensitivity and 87% specificity in high-risk patients who had nodules smaller than 20 millimeters. More than half of those in the cancer cohort had early Stage I or II lung cancer. CyPath \u00ae Lung detected multiple forms of cancer including adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and small cell lung cancer. \"In addition to the high sensitivity and specificity of CyPath Lung, physicians reported they were impressed by the findings of the peer-reviewed economic study by two prominent pulmonologists. This study demonstrated total savings of $379 million, or more than $2,700 per patient, would have resulted in 2022 had CyPath \u00ae Lung been the standard of care for Medicare patients,\" Zannes said. \"For patients with private insurance, the study concluded that savings would have been more than $6,400 per patient for total savings of more than $895 million.\" Michael J. Morris, M.D., Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC) pulmonology and critical care physician and Assistant Dean of Research at San Antonio Uniformed Services Health Education Consortium (SAUSHEC), and Sheila A. Habib, M.D., Director of the Pulmonary Lung Nodule Clinic and the Lung Cancer Screening Program at the South Texas Veterans Health Care Systems\u2019 Audie L. Murphy Memorial Veterans Hospital were first and second authors on the study published in the Journal of Health Economics and Outcomes Research . Story Continues \"As more physicians order more CyPath \u00ae Lung tests for their patients, doctors are sharing their stories of early detection and the individual patients who are more likely to have a positive outcome despite a diagnosis of lung cancer,\" Ms. Zannes said. \"Needless to say, this is one of the most gratifying parts of the work we do, and we are looking forward to expanding our marketing effort working with our Key Opinion Leaders in 2025 to grow our market share and improve early diagnosis of lung cancer and provide peace of mind to patients at risk.\" About CyPath \u00ae Lung CyPath \u00ae Lung uses advanced flow cytometry and artificial intelligence (AI) to identify cell populations in patient sputum that indicate malignancy.

Words such as \"may,\" \"might,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"continue,\" \"predict,\" \"forecast,\" \"project,\" \"plan,\" \"intend\" or similar expressions, or statements regarding intent, belief, or current expectations, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based upon current estimates and assumptions and include statements regarding continued sales growth in 2025, launching sales to Veteran and military medical systems in 2025, and looking forward to working with Key Opinion Leaders in 2025 to expand the Company\u2019s market to improve early diagnosis of lung cancer and provide peace of mind to patients at risk. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict, that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations and assumptions from those set forth or implied by any forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, among others, the Company\u2019s ability to continue sales growth in 2025 and the other factors discussed in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and its subsequent filings with the SEC, including subsequent periodic reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Such forward-looking statements are based on facts and conditions as they exist at the time such statements are made and predictions as to future facts and conditions. While the Company believes these forward-looking statements are reasonable, readers of this press release are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. The information in this release is provided only as of the date of this release, and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement relating to matters discussed in this press release, except as may be required by applicable securities laws.

11:00 PM 4 min read In This Article: MSM -1.37% GHM -0.84% GTES -2.13% MSC Industrial Direct Company, Inc. MSM reported first-quarter fiscal 2025 (ended on Nov. 30, 2024) adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 86 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents. The bottom line marked a 31% plunge from earnings of $1.25 in the year-ago quarter. The downfall was attributed to lower sales, higher operating expenses and elevated interest costs. Including one-time items, MSC Industrial reported EPS of 83 cents compared with the year-ago quarter\u2019s $1.22. Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar. MSM Stock Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise MSC Industrial Direct Company, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | MSC Industrial Direct Company, Inc. Quote MSC Industrial\u2019s Revenues Hurt by Weak Demand MSM generated revenues of $928.5 million in the quarter under review, down 2.7% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues were impacted by weak demand, unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and negative impacts of pricing. The top line, however, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $905 million. Average daily sales fell 2.7% year over year in the quarter, led by lower volumes, somewhat offset by acquisition benefits. However, this came in higher than MSC Industrial\u2019s guidance of a 4.5-5.5% decline. Low Volumes & Higher Expenses Dent MSM\u2019s Margins The cost of goods sold decreased 1.9% year over year to $550 million. Gross profit moved down 4% to $378 million. The gross margin in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was 40.7% compared with the year-ago quarter\u2019s 41.2%. The gross margin contracted 50 basis points due to lower volumes, and acquisitions created a 20-basis-point headwind. Operating expenses rose 4% year over year to around $304 million in the fiscal first quarter. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher payroll costs due to higher associate headcount to support MSM\u2019s strategic growth investments and annual merit increases, and investments made to supporting digital initiatives and solutions growth. MSC Industrial reported an operating income of $72.3 million compared with $101.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Excluding restructuring and other costs, MSM\u2019s adjusted operating income amounted to $74.6 million, down 28% from $104 million in the prior-year quarter. The adjusted operating margin was 8% in the reported quarter compared with the prior-year quarter\u2019s 10.9% due to higher operating expenses on lower revenues. MSC Industrial\u2019s Cash & Debt Position MSM had cash and cash equivalents of $57.3 million at the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2025 compared with $29.6 million at the end of fiscal 2024. The company generated cash flow from operating activities of $102 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared with $81 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Story Continues MSC Industrial repurchased approximately 150 thousand shares in the quarter, and returned in excess of $60 million to shareholders as dividends and share repurchases The company\u2019s long-term debt was $290 million at the end of the reported quarter, up from $279 million at the end of fiscal 2024. MSM Anticipates Average Daily Sales to Decline in Q2 Citing challenging macro conditions and the weak performance in December, MSC Industrial expects average daily sales to decline 3-5% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. The adjusted operating margin for the quarter is expected between 6.5% and 7.5%. MSC Industrial Stock Price Performance The company\u2019s shares have declined 11.9% in the past year compared with the industrial services industry\u2019s growth of 8.8%.

Should Retain GFF Stock in Your Portfolio Now Zacks Equity Research Thu, Jan 9, 2025, 1:42 PM 4 min read In This Article: GFF -2.40% GHM -0.84% FSS -1.51% GTES -2.13% Griffon Corporation GFF is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of strength across the Home and Building Products (HBP) segment. The company's efforts to reward its shareholders handsomely add to its appeal. Based in New York, Griffon Corporation is a diversified holding company with exposure in several industries. The company engages in the manufacture and sale of a wide range of consumer and professional, and home and building products, including garage doors, shutters, materials for disposable diapers and disposable health care products. GFF currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). In the past year, the stock has gained 22.7% against the industry\u2019s 9.2% decline. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Let\u2019s discuss the factors that should influence investors to retain this company for the time being. Business Strength: Griffon is witnessing strong momentum in the HBP segment. Increased demand for residential products, supported by the resiliency of repair and remodeling activity in the residential construction market, is driving the segment\u2019s results. The U.S. residential construction market is recovering in single-family housing, supported by lower interest rates and builder incentives, which is likely to be beneficial for the segment in the quarters ahead. The recovery in the commercial construction market, driven by several projects undertaken by customers, is expected to benefit the segment. Expansion Initiatives: GFF solidifies its product portfolio and leverages business opportunities through asset additions. In July 2024, it acquired an Australia-based company, Pope (a provider of residential watering products), through its subsidiary, The AMES Companies, Inc. (AMES). Pope, which has been added to Griffon\u2019s CPP segment, has expanded its product portfolio in the Australian market. The acquisition of Pope is anticipated to generate annual revenues of around $25 million and positively impact the company's earnings in the first full year of ownership. Investment in Innovation and Capacity Expansion: Griffon continues to invest in productivity, innovation and capacity expansion to further drive growth. For instance, in 2023, the company expanded Clopay's Troy manufacturing facility, which will improve Griffon\u2019s manufacturing efficiencies and introduce new product lines. This apart, the company also expanded the sectional door manufacturing capacity in Ohio to cater to increasing demand for its premium products. These projects signify a significant investment in the expansion and modernization of the company\u2019s key manufacturing and distribution facilities. Griffon plans to make additional investments in capacity expansion and technology in 2025. Rewards to Shareholders: GFF has a strong balance sheet that has enabled it to reward its shareholders handsomely through dividend payments and share buybacks. In fiscal 2024 (ended September 2024), it paid dividends worth $35.8 million and repurchased shares for $309.9 million. In November 2024, Griffon announced that the board of directors approved a new $400,000 share repurchase authorization. Also, in November 2024, the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 20%. Story Continues Downsides of GFF Stock Segmental Weakness: Weakness in the CPP segment raises concerns for Griffon. Reduced consumer demand in North America has been weighing on the segment's performance. Demand for products like outdoor tools, project tools and outdoor decor and watering products has been particularly weak. Forex Woes: GFF's international presence keeps it exposed to the risk of adverse currency fluctuations. This is because a strengthening U.S. dollar is likely to require the company to either raise prices or contract profit margins in locations outside the United States. Thus, adverse currency movements are a worry. Stocks to Consider Better-ranked companies are discussed below. Graham Corporation GHM currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

+0.33% DOCS 0.00% U.S. stock markets witnessed an impressive rally in 2024 after an astonishing bull run in 2023. Following the 24.2% ascent in 2023, the S&P 500 rallied 23.3% last year. The benchmark jumped 53% in the last two years recording its best performance since the nearly 66% rally in 1997-98. The broad-market index posted 57 all-time highs in 2024. The Dow and the Nasdaq Composite rallied 12.9% and 28.6%, respectively, last year. However, Wall Street failed to maintain its momentum last month and ended mostly in negative territory. In December, the Dow plummeted 5.3%, reflecting its worst monthly performance since September 2022. The S&P 500 tumbled 2.5%, marking its worst monthly performance since April 2024. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite was up a mere 0.5%. However, a handful of stocks are expected to maintain their momentum in January too. Five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank are: Doximity Inc. DOCS, Southwest Airlines Co. LUV, Alaska Air Group Inc. ALK, Dropbox Inc. DBX and Paramount Global PARAA. Top 5 Momentum Picks for January These five stocks have strong momentum for January and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of the stocks sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present and has a Zacks Momentum Score of A. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here . The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past six months. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Doximity Inc. Doximity provides digital platform for medical professionals. DOCS\u2019 network members include physicians across all specialties and practice areas. DOCS provides its verified clinical membership with digital tools built for medicine, enabling them to collaborate with colleagues, stay up to date with the latest medical news and research, manage their careers and conduct virtual patient visits. Doximity has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 13.4% and 14.5%, respectively, for the current year (ending March 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 10% in the last 60 days. Southwest Airlines Co. Southwest Airlines has been benefiting from improvement in air travel demand. Given that travel demand has remained healthy, LUV anticipates fourth-quarter 2024 unit revenues to increase 5.5-7% on a year-over-year basis. As part of its growth strategy, LUV is focused on its cost-cutting initiatives and fleet-modernization techniques. LUV's liquidity position is also encouraging. A solid balance sheet allows Southwest Airlines to reward its shareholders through share buybacks and dividend payments. We believe that the positives surrounding the LUV stock outweigh the concerns of escalating labor costs. We, therefore, suggest investors to add the LUV stock to their portfolio for healthy returns. Story Continues Southwest Airlines has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 5.8% and 107.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.5% in the last 30 days. Alaska Air Group Inc. Alaska Air Group has been benefiting from an improvement in air travel demand. With people taking to the skies again following the end of the pandemic, total revenues at ALK increased 4% in the first nine months of 2024, driven by a 4% uptick in passenger revenues. ALK\u2019s fleet modernization initiatives look encouraging. The inclusion of modern planes in its fleet and the retirement of the old ones are in line with ALK\u2019s environmentally friendly approach. On a shareholder-friendly note, management resumed share buybacks in 2023. Low fuel costs are also aiding ALK\u2019s bottom line. The completion of the buyout of Hawaiian Holdings is another positive. Alaska Air Group has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 24.3% and 34.3%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 8.7% in the last 30 days. Dropbox Inc. Dropbox is benefiting from an expanding user base and strong average revenue per paying user (ARPU) growth. DBX exited third-quarter 2024 with 18.24 million paying users while ARPU was $139.05 compared with $138.71 in the year-ago quarter. The upside was driven by the Teams pricing increase. DBX is a leader in the content sharing and collaboration applications category. Dropbox currently supports more than 700 million registered users through its FSS plans and has better market share than Apple and Box. DBX has a strong balance sheet and generates strong free cash flow. Dropbox has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 0.2% and 9.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 19.7% in the last 60 days. Paramount Global Paramount Global operates as a media, streaming, and entertainment company worldwide. PARAA operates through TV Media, Direct-to-Consumer, and Filmed Entertainment segments. PARAA\u2019s portfolio of consumer brands includes CBS, Showtime Networks, Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, BET, Paramount, Pluto TV and Simon & Schuster, among others. Paramount Global has an expected earnings growth rate of 54.7% for the current year. Although its revenue growth rate is negative for the current year, it is 0.2% for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved more than 100% in the last 60 days. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"Federal Signal (FSS) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 1, 2025, 8:45 PM 3 min read In This Article: FSS -1.51% Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock. By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss. However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks. Federal Signal (FSS) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank. Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better. Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this company that makes products ranging from street sweepers to toll booth technology for government, industrial and commercial customers a great growth pick right now. Earnings Growth Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration. While the historical EPS growth rate for Federal Signal is 12.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 33.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 7.4%. Cash Flow Growth While cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds. Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Federal Signal is 24%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -7.7%. While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 11.8% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 9%. Story Continues Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Federal Signal. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month. Bottom Line Federal Signal has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. This combination positions Federal Signal well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.

(AKC \u00ae ), the world's largest purebred dog registry and leading advocate for dogs, is excited to announce that the Danish-Swedish Farmdog has received full recognition and is the AKC's 202 nd breed. The Danish-Swedish Farmdog is eligible to compete in the Working Group. A breed that is newly recognized does not mean that the breed is newly created. Many breeds that gain full AKC recognition have existed for decades, and some are ancient. Danish-Swedish Farmdog standing outdoors at dusk. \"We are excited to welcome the Danish-Swedish Farmdog to the AKC registry as our 202 nd breed,\" said Gina DiNardo , AKC Executive Secretary. \"This compact working dog is very versatile, loves a challenge and having a job to do. It would make a wonderful addition to a family that is able to provide it with the exercise and mental stimulation that it needs. As always, we strongly encourage prospective dog owners to do their research to find the best breed for their lifestyle.\" Joining the Working Group, the Danish-Swedish Farmdog is a people-oriented, friendly, loving companion. The breed was originally known as the Danish Pinscher and could be found on farms in Denmark and Southern Sweden as a multipurpose barnyard dog. The Danish-Swedish Farmdog performed a variety of jobs, but its specialty was vermin control. These compact dogs are versatile, love to work and enjoy a challenge. They are coordinated, agile and very fast, needing daily exercise. This breed is low maintenance when it comes to grooming, with the occasional brushing and bath being all that they need to look their best. AKC Recognition offers the breed the opportunity to compete at all levels of AKC sports and events, as there are over 26,000 held each year. To become an AKC-recognized breed, there must be an active following and interest in the breed by owners in the U.S. and an established breed club of responsible owners and breeders. There also must be a sufficient population of dogs in the United States geographically distributed throughout the country. Breeds working towards full recognition are recorded in AKC's Foundation Stock Service\u00ae (FSS\u00ae). Additional information on the process can be found at www.akc.org . About the American Kennel Club Founded in 1884, the American Kennel Club is a not-for-profit organization which maintains the largest registry of purebred dogs in the world and oversees the sport of purebred dogs in the United States .
