AT&T 4Q24 EARNINGS & HIGHLIGHTS Consolidated Financial Results Revenues for the fourth quarter totaled $32.3 billion versus $32.0 billion in the year-ago quarter, up 0.9%. This was due to higher Mobility service and equipment revenues and Consumer Wireline revenues, partially offset by declines in Business Wireline and Mexico . Operating expenses were $27.0 billion versus $26.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. Operating expenses increased primarily due to higher depreciation from accelerated depreciation on wireless network equipment associated with our Open RAN network modernization efforts, as well as our continued fiber investment and network upgrades. Additionally, equipment costs increased year over year in line with higher Mobility equipment revenues and these increases were partially offset by a prior-year charge, that did not recur, for the abandonment of non-deployed wireless equipment in connection with our network modernization efforts, and benefits from continued transformation. Operating income was $5.3 billion , consistent with the year-ago quarter. When adjusting for certain items, adjusted operating income* was $5.4 billion versus $5.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. Equity in net income of affiliates was $1.1 billion , primarily from the DIRECTV investment, versus $0.3 billion in the year-ago quarter, reflecting cash distributions received by AT&T in excess of AT&T's share of DIRECTV's earnings. Net income was $4.4 billion versus $2.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. Net income (loss) attributable to common stock was $4.0 billion versus $2.1 billion in the year-ago quarter. Earnings per diluted common share was $0.56 versus $0.30 in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for ($0.02) which includes a benefit from tax items offset by an actuarial loss on benefit plans and other items, adjusted earnings per diluted common share* was $0.54 , consistent with the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA * was $10.8 billion versus $10.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. Cash from operating activities was $11.9 billion , up $0.5 billion year over year, reflecting higher cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as operating, working capital timing, including lower device payments, and operational improvements, partially offset by higher cash tax payments. Capital expenditures were $6.8 billion versus $4.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. Capital investment * totaled $7.1 billion versus $5.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. Cash payments for vendor financing totaled $0.2 billion versus $1.0 billion in the year-ago quarter. Free cash flow * was $4.8 billion versus $6.4 billion in the year-ago quarter as the Company continued to drive a more ratable quarterly free cash flow cadence. Full-Year Financial Results Revenues for the full year totaled $122.3 billion versus $122.4 billion in 2023, down 0.1%, primarily driven by lower revenues from Business Wireline service revenue and Mobility equipment revenue, offset by higher Mobility service and Consumer Wireline, and Mexico revenues. Operating expenses for the full year were $103.3 billion versus $99.0 billion in 2023, primarily due to a $4.4 billion non-cash goodwill impairment in the third quarter. Additionally, the annual increase was driven by our Open RAN network modernization efforts, including accelerated depreciation on wireless network equipment and restructuring costs, and higher depreciation from continued fiber investment and network upgrades, partially offset by lower Mobility equipment costs from lower sales volumes and benefits from continued transformation efforts, including lower personnel. Operating income for the full year was $19.0 billion versus $23.5 billion in 2023. When adjusting for certain items, adjusted operating income* was $24.2 billion versus $24.7 billion a year ago. Equity in net income of affiliates for the full year was $2.0 billion , primarily from the DIRECTV investment. With adjustment for our proportionate share of intangible amortization, adjusted equity in net income from the DIRECTV investment* for full-year 2024 was $2.8 billion . Net income for the full year was $12.3 billion versus $15.6 billion a year ago. Net income attributable to common stock for the full year was $10.7 billion versus $14.2 billion a year ago. Earnings per diluted common share was $1.49 versus $1.97 for full-year 2023. With adjustments for both years, adjusted earnings per diluted common share* was $2.26 compared to $2.41 for full-year 2023. Adjusted earnings per diluted common share, excluding DIRECTV*, was $1.95 for full-year 2024. Adjusted EBITDA * for the full year was $44.8 billion versus $43.4 billion a year ago. Cash from operating activities for the full year was $38.8 billion , up $0.5 billion from a year ago, reflecting working capital timing and operational improvements, partially offset by higher cash tax payments. Capital expenditures were $20.3 billion for the full year versus $17.9 billion a year ago. Capital investment * totaled $22.1 billion for the full year versus $23.6 billion a year ago. Cash payments for vendor financing totaled $1.8 billion versus $5.7 billion a year ago. Free cash flow * was $17.6 billion for the full year compared to $16.8 billion a year ago.

Cautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements Information set forth in this news release contains financial estimates and other forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially. A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in AT&T's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AT&T disclaims any obligation to update and revise statements contained in this news release based on new information or otherwise. This news release may contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP financial measures and the GAAP financial measures are available on the Company's website at https://investors.att.com . Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations to GAAP Measures Schedules and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures cited in this document to the most directly comparable financial measures under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) can be found at https://investors.att.com and in our Form 8-K dated January\u00a027, 2025. Adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted operating income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, net debt and net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures frequently used by investors and credit rating agencies. Adjusted diluted EPS is calculated by excluding from operating revenues, operating expenses, other income (expenses) and income tax expense, certain significant items that are non-operational or non-recurring in nature, including dispositions and merger integration and transaction costs, actuarial gains and losses, significant abandonments and impairments, benefit-related gains and losses, employee separation and other material gains and losses. Non-operational items arising from asset acquisitions and dispositions include the amortization of intangible assets. While the expense associated with the amortization of certain wireless licenses and customer lists is excluded, the revenue of the acquired companies is reflected in the measure and those assets contribute to revenue generation. We also adjust for net actuarial gains or losses associated with our pension and postemployment benefit plans due to the often-significant impact on our results (we immediately recognize this gain or loss in the income statement, pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses). Consequently, our adjusted results reflect an expected return on plan assets rather than the actual return on plan assets, as included in the GAAP measure of income. The tax impact of adjusting items is calculated using the effective tax rate during the quarter except for adjustments that, given their magnitude, can drive a change in the effective tax rate, in these cases, we use the actual tax expense or combined marginal rate of approximately 25%. For 4Q24 , adjusted EPS of $0.54 is diluted EPS of $0.56 adjusted for $0.01 of net actuarial loss and other benefit-related, transaction and other costs, minus $0.03 benefit from tax items. For 4Q23 , adjusted EPS of $0.54 is diluted EPS of $0.30 adjusted for $0.18 actuarial loss on benefit plans, $0.06 restructuring and impairments, $0.03 proportionate share of intangible amortization at the DIRECTV equity method investment, and $0.01 benefit-related, transaction and other costs, minus $0.04 benefit from tax items. For 2024 , adjusted EPS of $2.26 is diluted EPS of $1.49 adjusted for $0.72 restructuring and impairments, $0.09 proportionate share of intangible amortization at the DIRECTV equity method investment, and $0.01 actuarial loss on benefit plans, minus $0.03 benefit from tax items and $0.02 of benefit-related, transaction and other costs. For 2023 , adjusted EPS of $2.41 is diluted EPS of $1.97 adjusted for $0.18 restructuring and impairments, $0.17 net actuarial and settlement loss on benefit plans, and $0.14 proportionate share of intangible amortization at the DIRECTV equity method investment, minus $0.04 benefit from tax items and $0.01 of benefit-related, transaction and other costs. Beginning with reporting of first-quarter 2025 results, the company plans to revise its definition of adjusted EPS to remove the equity in net income from our investment in DIRECTV, which we have agreed to sell to TPG. For 2024, Adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV of $1.95 is diluted EPS of $1.49 adjusted for $0.72 restructuring and impairments, and $0.01 actuarial loss on benefit plans, minus $0.22 equity in net income of DIRECTV, $0.03 benefit from tax items and $0.02 of benefit-related, transaction and other costs. The Company expects adjustments to 2025 reported diluted EPS to include an adjustment to remove equity in net income of DIRECTV, a non-cash mark-to-market benefit plan gain/loss, and other items. The adjustment to remove the equity in net income of DIRECTV is dependent upon cash distributions from DIRECTV and the timing of the closing of the sale of our DIRECTV investment, which is expected in mid-2025. The Company expects the mark-to-market adjustment, which is driven by interest rates and investment returns that are not reasonably estimable at this time, to be a significant item. Our projected 2025 adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV depends on future levels of revenues and expenses, most of which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between this projected non-GAAP metric and the most comparable GAAP metric without unreasonable effort. Adjusted operating income is operating income adjusted for revenues and costs we consider non-operational in nature, including items arising from asset acquisitions or dispositions. For 4Q24 , adjusted operating income of $5.4 billion is calculated as operating income of $5.3 billion plus $0.1 billion of adjustments. For 4Q23 , adjusted operating income of $5.8 billion is calculated as operating income of $5.3 billion plus $0.5 billion of adjustments. For 2024 , adjusted operating income of $24.2 billion is calculated as operating income of $19.0 billion plus $5.2 billion of adjustments. For 2023 , adjusted operating income of $24.7 billion is calculated as operating income of $23.5 billion plus $1.2 billion of adjustments. Adjustments for all periods are detailed in the Discussion and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures included in our Form 8-K dated January 27, 2025 . EBITDA is net income plus income tax, interest, and depreciation and amortization expenses minus equity in net income of affiliates and other income (expense) \u2013 net. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from EBITDA certain significant items that are non-operational or non-recurring in nature, including dispositions and merger integration and transaction costs, significant abandonments and impairments, benefit-related gains and losses, employee separation and other material gains and losses.\u00a0Adjusted EBITDA, Mobility EBITDA, Business Wireline EBITDA and Consumer Wireline EBITDA\u00a0estimates depend on future levels of revenues and expenses which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide reconciliations between these projected non-GAAP metrics and the most comparable GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. For 4Q24 , adjusted EBITDA of $10.8 billion is calculated as net income of $4.4 billion , plus income tax expense of $0.9 billion , plus interest expense of $1.7 billion , minus equity in net income of affiliates of $1.1 billion , minus other income (expense) \u2013 net of $0.6 billion , plus depreciation and amortization of $5.4 billion , plus adjustments of $0.1 billion . For 4Q23 , adjusted EBITDA of $10.6 billion is calculated as net income of $2.6 billion , plus income tax expense of $0.4 billion , plus interest expense of $1.7 billion , minus equity in net income of affiliates of $0.3 billion , plus other income (expense) \u2013 net of $(0.9) billion , plus depreciation and amortization of $4.8 billion , plus adjustments of $0.5 billion . For 2024 , adjusted EBITDA of $44.8 billion is calculated as net income of $12.3 billion , plus income tax expense of $4.4 billion , plus interest expense of $6.8 billion , minus equity in net income of affiliates of $2.0 billion , minus other income (expense) \u2013 net of $2.4 billion , plus depreciation and amortization of $20.6 billion , plus adjustments of $5.1 billion . For 2023 , adjusted EBITDA of $43.4 billion is calculated as net income of $15.6 billion , plus income tax expense of $4.2 billion , plus interest expense of $6.7 billion , minus equity in net income of affiliates of $1.7 billion , minus other income (expense) \u2013 net of $1.4 billion , plus depreciation and amortization of $18.8 billion , plus adjustments of $1.2 billion . Adjustments for all periods are detailed in the Discussion and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures included in our Form 8-K dated January 27, 2025 . At the segment or business unit level, EBITDA is operating income before depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is operating income before depreciation and amortization, divided by total revenues. EBITDA service margin is operating income before depreciation and amortization, divided by total service revenues. Free cash flow for 4Q24 of $4.8 billion is cash from operating activities of $11.9 billion , minus capital expenditures of $6.8 billion and cash paid for vendor financing of $0.2 billion (there were no cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities in 4Q24).\u00a0For 4Q23 , free cash flow of $6.4 billion is cash from operating activities of $11.4 billion , plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $0.6 billion , minus capital expenditures of $4.6 billion and cash paid for vendor financing of $1.0 billion . For 2024 , free cash flow of $17.6 billion is cash from operating activities of $38.8 billion , plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $0.9 billion , minus capital expenditures of $20.3 billion and cash paid for vendor financing of $1.8 billion . For 2023 , free cash flow of $16.8 billion is cash from operating activities of $38.3 billion , plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $2.0 billion , minus capital expenditures of $17.9 billion and cash paid for vendor financing of $5.7 billion . Beginning with the reporting of first-quarter 2025 results, the Company plans to revise its definition of free cash flow to remove cash flows related to DIRECTV (distributions reported in both operating and investing activities). Free cash flow excluding DIRECTV is expected to be defined as cash from operations minus cash flows related to our DIRECTV equity method investment (cash distributions less cash taxes paid from DIRECTV), minus capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing (classified as financing activities). For 2024 , free cash flow excluding DIRECTV of $15.3 billion is cash from operating activities of $38.8 billion , less cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as operating activities of $2.0 billion , plus cash taxes paid on DIRECTV of $0.7 billion , minus capital expenditures of $20.3 billion and cash paid for vendor financing of $1.8 billion . Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash from operating activities, capital expenditures and vendor financing payments, the Company is not able to provide a reconciliation between projected free cash flow excluding DIRECTV and the most comparable GAAP metric without unreasonable effort. Capital investment provides a comprehensive view of cash used to invest in our networks, product developments and support systems. In connection with capital improvements, we have favorable payment terms of 120 days or more with certain vendors, referred to as vendor financing, which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported as financing activities. Capital investment includes capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing ( $0.2 billion in 4Q24, $1.0 billion in 4Q23, $1.8 billion in 2024, and $5.7 billion in 2023). Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact capital expenditures and vendor financing payments, the Company is not able to provide a reconciliation between projected capital investment and the most comparable GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. Adjusted equity in net income from DIRECTV investment of $2.8 billion for 2024 is calculated as equity income from DIRECTV of $2.0 billion reported in Equity in Net Income of Affiliates and excludes $0.8 billion of AT&T's proportionate share of the non-cash depreciation and amortization of fair value accretion from DIRECTV's revaluation of assets and purchase price allocation. Net debt of $120.1 billion at December 31, 2024 , is calculated as total debt of $123.5 billion less cash and cash equivalents of $3.3 billion and time deposits (i.e. deposits at financial institutions that are greater than 90 days) of $0.2 billion . Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA is calculated by dividing net debt by the sum of the most recent four quarters of adjusted EBITDA. Net debt and adjusted EBITDA are calculated as defined above. Net debt and adjusted EBITDA estimates depend on future levels of revenues, expenses and other metrics which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between projected net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA and the most comparable GAAP metrics and related ratios without unreasonable effort. Discussion and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures We believe the following measures are relevant and useful information to investors as they are part of AT&T's internal management reporting and planning processes and are important metrics that management uses to evaluate the operating performance of AT&T and its segments. Management also uses these measures as a method of comparing performance with that of many of our competitors. These measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations and cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities minus capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing (classified as financing activities). Free cash flow after dividends is defined as cash from operations and cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities, minus capital expenditures, cash paid for vendor financing and dividends on common and preferred shares. Free cash flow dividend payout ratio is defined as the percentage of dividends paid on common and preferred shares to free cash flow. We believe these metrics provide useful information to our investors because management views free cash flow as an important indicator of how much cash is generated by routine business operations, including capital expenditures and vendor financing, and from our continued economic interest in the U.S. video operations as part of our DIRECTV equity method investment, and makes decisions based on it. Management also views free cash flow as a measure of cash available to pay debt and return cash to shareowners.

For AT&T, EBITDA excludes other income (expense) \u2013 net, and equity in net income (loss) of affiliates, as these do not reflect the operating results of our subscriber base or operations that are not under our control. Equity in net income (loss) of affiliates represents the proportionate share of the net income (loss) of affiliates in which we exercise significant influence, but do not control. Because we do not control these entities, management excludes these results when evaluating the performance of our primary operations. EBITDA also excludes interest expense and the provision for income taxes. Excluding these items eliminates the expenses associated with our capital and tax structures. Finally, EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments. EBITDA does not give effect to cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses. EBITDA is not presented as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flows from operations, as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures are used by management as a gauge of our success in acquiring, retaining and servicing subscribers because we believe these measures reflect AT&T's ability to generate and grow subscriber revenues while providing a high level of customer service in a cost-effective manner. Management also uses these measures as a method of comparing cash generation potential with that of many of its competitors. The financial and operating metrics which affect EBITDA include the key revenue and expense drivers for which management is responsible and upon which we evaluate performance. We believe EBITDA Service Margin (EBITDA as a percentage of service revenues) to be a more relevant measure than EBITDA Margin (EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue) for our Mobility business unit operating margin. We also use wireless service revenues to calculate margin to facilitate comparison, both internally and externally with our wireless competitors, as they calculate their margins using wireless service revenues as well. There are material limitations to using these non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA, EBITDA margin and EBITDA service margin, as we have defined them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Furthermore, these performance measures do not take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense, tax expense and equity in net income (loss) of affiliates. For market comparability, management analyzes performance measures that are similar in nature to EBITDA as we present it, and considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with its analysis of net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA, EBITDA margin and EBITDA service margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.

While the expense associated with the amortization of certain wireless licenses and customer lists is excluded, the revenue of the acquired companies is reflected in the measure and that those assets contribute to revenue generation. We also adjust for net actuarial gains or losses associated with our pension and postemployment benefit plans due to the often-significant impact on our results (we immediately recognize this gain or loss in the income statement, pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses). Consequently, our adjusted results reflect an expected return on plan assets rather than the actual return on plan assets, as included in the GAAP measure of income. The tax impact of adjusting items is calculated using the effective tax rate during the quarter except for adjustments that, given their magnitude, can drive a change in the effective tax rate, in these cases we use the actual tax expense or combined marginal rate of approximately 25%.

Our Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio is calculated by dividing the Net Debt by the sum of the most recent four quarters Adjusted EBITDA. Net Debt is calculated by subtracting cash and cash equivalents and deposits at financial institutions that are greater than 90 days (e.g., certificates of deposit and time deposits), from the sum of debt maturing within one year and long-term debt.

Passive Income in 2025 Keith Speights, The Motley Fool Sun, Jan 26, 2025, 1:46 PM 5 min read In This Article: DSL -0.47% BLK -5.74% What's a way to generate significant passive income that many investors don't know about? Closed-end funds (CEFs) . They're similar to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in that they trade like stocks on public exchanges. The main difference is that CEFs have a fixed number of shares whereas ETFs can issue new shares. If you're an income investor, CEFs might be especially attractive. There are many funds from which to choose, but a few stand out to me. Investing $10,000 into each of these CEFs could make you over $4,700 in passive income in 2025. 1. AllianceBernstein Global High Income Fund The \"high income\" in the AllianceBernstein Global High Income Fund 's (NYSE: AWF) name isn't just marketing hype. This CEF offers a distribution yield of 6.9%. An initial investment of $10,000 in the fund should generate $690 in passive income this year based on that yield. This CEF invests mainly in corporate debt securities. Most of its portfolio is in lower-rated corporate bonds (which generate higher yields), but the fund's holdings can also include investment-grade corporate bonds, government bonds, and other assets. The AllianceBernstein Global High Income Fund currently has 1,218 holdings. 2. BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund The BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund (NYSE: DSU) pays an especially juicy distribution yield of 11.04%. If you bought $10,000 worth of the fund's shares, you'd likely receive income in the ballpark of $1,104 in 2025. Instead of bonds, this CEF primarily invests in other corporate debt instruments -- mainly corporate loans. Some (although not all) of these loans are secured by assets pledged as collateral. This generally makes them safer to invest in than other types of corporate debt. 3. Cohen & Steers Infrastructure Fund The Cohen & Steers Infrastructure Fund (NYSE: UTF) attempts to generate income by investing in stocks and debt issued by infrastructure companies. It currently has 252 holdings with top positions including five energy and utility stocks: NextEra Energy , NiSource , TC Energy , PPL , and Duke Energy . This CEF's distribution yield stands at 7.63%. An initial investment of $10,000 should enable you to rake in around $763 in passive income this year. 4. DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund The DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund (NYSE: DSL) has two goals: (1) provide a high level of income, and (2) deliver capital appreciation. It's definitely achieving the first goal these days with a distribution yield of 10.48%. Investing $10,000 in the CEF should give you income of roughly $1,048 in 2025. Story Continues This CEF is managed by Jeffrey Gundlach, who some call the \"Bond King.\" Unsurprisingly, the fund invests primarily in bonds, most of which are below investment grade. The DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund's holdings also include asset-backed securities, bank loans, and collateralized loan obligations. 5. Pimco Dynamic Income Opportunities Fund I've saved the biggest passive income generator for last. The Pimco Dynamic Income Opportunities Fund (NYSE: PDO) pays a distribution yield of 11.2%. Buying $10,000 worth of the fund's shares should make you $1,120 in income this year. Like the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund, the Pimco Dynamic Income Opportunities Fund focuses primarily on delivering income and secondarily on capital appreciation. This CEF's holdings include non-agency mortgages, U.S. government bonds, and high-yield credit assets. Four things to know about these CEFs Could investing $10,000 in each of the above CEFs really make you over $4,700 in passive income this year? Absolutely. However, there are four things income investors should know about them. First, the actual amount of income you receive could be lower than $4,700. It's possible that one or more of these funds could reduce their distributions in the coming months. On the other hand, some or all of them could also increase their distributions. Second, the share prices of these CEFs could be volatile. As is the case with investing in stocks and ETFs, investing in CEFs could entail losses. That said, several of these funds have delivered impressive total returns over the last year. Third, unlike most ETFs, CEFs often use leverage. For example, the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund's leverage from borrowing is 22.05%. The use of leverage can boost income generated but can also cause losses to be greater. Fourth, these CEFs have greater annual expenses than many ETFs do. The funds' managers charge hefty fees for delivering such juicy distributions. For example, the BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund's gross expense ratio is 2.47%. The good news, though, is the yields discussed earlier are net of any expenses.
