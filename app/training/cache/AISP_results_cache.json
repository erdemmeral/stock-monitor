(NASDAQ:AISP) editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Thu, Dec 26, 2024, 3:28 PM 6 min read In This Article: AISP -3.13% AISPW -2.07% Key Insights Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Airship AI Holdings fair value estimate is US$6.61 Current share price of US$5.54 suggests Airship AI Holdings is potentially trading close to its fair value When compared to the industry average discount to fair value of 9.9%, Airship AI Holdings' competitors seem to be trading at a lesser discount Does the December share price for Airship AI Holdings, Inc. ( NASDAQ:AISP ) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple! We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model . View our latest analysis for Airship AI Holdings What's The Estimated Valuation? We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.10m US$3.27m US$4.58m US$5.89m US$7.12m US$8.22m US$9.17m US$9.99m US$10.7m US$11.3m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x1 Est @ 55.87% Est @ 39.89% Est @ 28.71% Est @ 20.88% Est @ 15.40% Est @ 11.57% Est @ 8.88% Est @ 7.01% Est @ 5.69% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% US$2.0 US$2.9 US$3.7 US$4.5 US$5.1 US$5.5 US$5.7 US$5.8 US$5.8 US$5.7 (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$47m Story Continues After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.0%. Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$11m\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (7.0%\u2013 2.6%) = US$263m Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = US$263m\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.0%) 10 = US$134m The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$180m. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$5.5, the company appears about fair value at a 16% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. NasdaqGM:AISP Discounted Cash Flow December 26th 2024 The Assumptions Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Airship AI Holdings as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.068. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for Airship AI Holdings Strength Debt is well covered by earnings. Weakness No major weaknesses identified for AISP. Opportunity Annual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market. Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value. Threat Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow. Total liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress. Looking Ahead: Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Security Administration Provides Additional Macro Tailwinds for 2025 & Beyond REDMOND, Wash., Nov. 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Airship AI Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: AISP) (\u201cAirship AI\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a leader in AI-driven video, sensor, and data management surveillance solutions, today reported its financial and operational results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. Q3 2024 Financial Highlights Net revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were $2.9 million. Gross profits for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were $2.2 million. Gross margin percentage was 75% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Higher margins were in part due to product mix, with reduced equipment purchases and increased Outpost AI sales. Operating loss was $1.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which reflected increased stock based compensation and overall sales levels. Other income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was $7.8 million, primarily due to a gain from a change in the fair value of earnout liability of $5.5 million, change in fair value of warrant liability of $1.5 million and change in fair value of convertible debt of $0.4 million. Net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was $6.2 million, or $0.25 per basic share, primarily related to noncash income of $7.8 million. Net cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Cash and cash equivalents was $6.5 million as of September 30, 2024. Closed an $8 million public offering with net proceeds of approximately $7.3 million, after deducting the estimated offering expenses, in the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Q3 2024 & Subsequent Operational Highlights Backlog as of September 30, 2024, was $6.6 million, representing firm fixed price contracts awarded in the second and third quarter that will be shipped and invoiced in the fourth quarter of 2024 or first quarter of 2025. Backlog is not indicative of future quarterly revenue as approximately 75% of quarterly revenue is transactional and recognized in the same quarter. Our total validated pipeline at the end of the quarter was approximately $130 million, consisting of single and multi-year opportunities for AI-driven edge, video, and sensor and data management platform across all our customer verticals. Our pipeline includes opportunities at varying stages of progression with expected award timeframes throughout the next 18-24 months. Due to the sensitive nature of many of our customers and deployment use cases, we are often restricted from publicly disclosing awards and or limited as to the specifics of the customer and use case. Consequently, the vast majority of our awards are executed on closed or restricted contract vehicles which further limits the sharing of information that might be otherwise available. Multiple large contracts awarded throughout the quarter including but not limited to: $4.0 million firm-fixed price contract for an agency within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), for advanced integrated solutions supporting real-time intelligence collection operations along the United States\u2019 borders, leveraging the Company\u2019s edge IoT appliance, Outpost AI. $1.2 million firm-fixed price support and maintenance contract for our existing deployment of Acropolis Enterprise Video and Data Management Platform supporting a Fortune 100 Transportation and E-Commerce company\u2019 global operations. We successfully completed a pilot opportunity to replace failing capabilities within critical infrastructure on the U.S. southern border, leading to an Airship AI brand-name only award that will be shipped and installed in the fourth quarter of 2024. This initial award is in support of our single-largest opportunity, valued at more than $50 million over the next four (4) years. Estimated total contract value is conservatively based on data points from published market research, including size and scope, and pricing approved via awarded procurement efforts. We participated in JIFX, or Joint Interagency Field Exercise, an invite only event led by the Naval Post-Graduate School. The JIFX team leads experimentation in alternative methods to enable rapid technological development by cultivating a community of interest and hosting broadly scoped quarterly collaborative field events which enable DoD, US government, and allied stakeholders to identify, influence, and accelerate early-stage technology development that address national and collective security challenges. We participated in TIDE, or Technology Innovation Discovery Event, an invite only Department of Defense (DoD) sponsored event that aims to help innovative small businesses and non-traditional DoD performers showcase new hardware and software technologies that can significantly improve existing software or meet new challenges in support of the National Defense Strategy. We were a primary sponsor of and participant in UTAC, the premier unmanned aerial and robotic systems tactical event for Police, Public Safety, Government, and Defense agencies. UTAC is a fully immersive training event where public safety, government, enterprise, and defense operators gather to learn best practices, establish procedures, and gain experience with the latest innovations in unmanned aerial, ground, and maritime systems along augmenting technical solutions. Completed $8.0 million at-market public offering with net proceeds to the company of $7.0 million after deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses.

Improve sourcing, supply chain management and production-based process efficiencies to help drive continued margin expansion. Targeted focus on brand awareness and engagement in new verticals through targeted marketing outreach opportunities, social media platforms, Airship AI hosted technology events, and industry tradeshow events. Management Commentary \u201cThe third quarter of 2024 saw continued momentum in support of our trajectory for triple-digit revenue growth for the full year,\u201d said Paul Allen, President of Airship AI. \u201cOur team was able to generate solid revenues for the quarter of $2.9 million at a gross margin percentage of 75%, our second consecutive quarter of gross margin percentages above 70%. We ended the quarter with $6.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1.1 million in accounts receivables. \"Historically, our third quarter tends to be slower due to the focus on the U.S. Government\u2019s fiscal year-end, during which many of our larger opportunities go out for bid in the September timeframe. We also saw several large opportunities pushed out to FY 2025 or drastically cut due to budget challenges across several federal agencies. Additionally, the completion of the capital raise late in the quarter caused delays in bringing in several opportunities as the funds were needed to cover the cost of goods sold for those opportunities. Despite these headwinds, we achieved 18% year-over-year growth in net revenue for the quarter and 61% net revenue growth as compared to full year 2023 revenue of $12.3 million. \"While our recently completed capital raise did not close in time to be reflected in the Q3 results, it has significantly enhanced our ability to execute large transactions, particularly those involving substantial up-front costs of goods sold. The capital raise has also enabled us to expand our sales, business development, and partner marketing capabilities by bringing in specialized industry expertise and experience in managing large-scale defense programs. We have already made progress toward this objective with the addition of several high-caliber team members, and we are in the process of bringing on even more talent to further strengthen our capabilities. \"With former President Trump's election as president-elect and his stated commitment to rapidly increase investments in securing the border, we are already seeing a positive shift in the market dynamics surrounding our pipeline. Currently our pipeline is heavily weighted to initiatives directly supporting the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and specifically Customs and Border Protection (CBP). This positions us exceptionally well to capitalize on increased investments in technology supporting securing the border as it leverages our strong relationship as an established, trusted partner of CBP, with a proven track record of successful software and hardware deployments across the agency. \u201cBuilding on our established presence in the federal law enforcement investigative environment, our rapidly expanding footprint in the broader federal market, including the Department of Defense (DoD), positions us to capitalize on the growing demand for AI-driven capabilities at the edge, an area where we have made significant investments. By transforming existing \u201cdumb\u201d sensors that require constant monitoring into autonomous systems that proactively alert users when specific conditions are met, we are not only revolutionizing homeland security, but also enhancing digital operations on battlefields worldwide,\u201d concluded Mr. Allen.
