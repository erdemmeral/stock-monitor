"Five9 Trades at a Premium EV/EBITDA Value: How to Play the Stock Vasundhara Sawalka Mon, Jan 20, 2025, 6:48 PM 4 min read In This Article: FIVN -1.22% Despite Five9 's FIVN compelling growth story and AI-driven potential, its current valuation metrics suggest investors might want to exercise caution and wait for a better entry point in 2025. The stock's significant 53.1% decline in the past year warrants a careful analysis of both fundamentals and valuation before making investment decisions. 1-Year Performance Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Valuation Analysis Five9's premium valuation is reflected in its trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 31.77x, which stands significantly above the Zacks Internet - Software industry average of 7.88x. Trading at more than four times its peer group average raises questions about the stock's near-term upside potential. While high-growth technology companies often command premium valuations, this substantial deviation from industry norms suggests the stock might be priced for perfection, leaving minimal room for execution missteps or market disappointments. FIVN\u2019s EV/EBITDA TTM Ratio Depicts Stretched Valuation Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Business Fundamentals The company's underlying business metrics demonstrate continued strength. Its fourth-quarter 2024 results showed encouraging growth with total revenues increasing 15% year over year to $264.2 million, while subscription revenues, representing nearly 80% of total revenues, accelerated to 20% growth. The adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 19.8%, and quarterly operating cash flow reached a record $41 million, indicating improving operational efficiency and profitability. AI Leadership and Enterprise Growth Five9's AI initiatives are gaining significant traction, evidenced by AI products contributing over 20% of the enterprise\u2019s new logo Annual Contract Value bookings in the third quarter. The average deal size, including AI components, was five times larger than those without AI over the last four quarters, suggesting strong market demand for AI-enhanced solutions. Additionally, the growth in $1M+ ARR customers, now representing approximately 56% of subscription revenues with 29% year-over-year growth, demonstrates successful enterprise market penetration. Strategic Position and Competition The company maintains strong strategic partnerships, particularly its eight-year relationship with Microsoft, and continues to innovate with features like the recently launched bi-directional presence capability. However, the CCaaS market is becoming increasingly competitive, with both established players and new entrants investing heavily in AI capabilities. This intensifying competition from major CCaaS providers like Twilio TWLO, RingCentral RNG and Zoom ZM Contact Center could pressure growth rates and margins in the future. Story Continues 2025 Outlook Management's preliminary guidance for 2025 suggests revenues of $1.13 billion, with expectations to surpass the current street consensus of $2.52 for non-GAAP EPS. While these projections demonstrate confidence in continued growth and margin expansion, much of this optimism appears to be reflected in the current valuation multiples. For fourth-quarter 2024, Five9 projects revenues between $267 million and $268 million and non-GAAP net income per share in the range of 69-71 cents, suggesting continued growth momentum heading into 2025. The company's focus on balancing growth with profitability is evident in its improving financial metrics and operational efficiency. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 indicates 13.21% year-over-year revenue growth to $1.03 billion. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.37 per share, suggesting a 15.61% rise year over year. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Find the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar . Investment Strategy Given the premium valuation and market uncertainties, investors might benefit from a patient approach to building positions in Five9. Several factors support this conservative stance. The high EV/EBITDA multiple indicates limited room for further multiple expansion, suggesting potential vulnerability to any execution missteps or market volatility. Macroeconomic uncertainties could continue to pressure high-multiple software stocks, potentially creating better entry points. Additionally, rising competition in the CCaaS market might impact growth rates and pricing power. Conclusion While Five9's long-term growth prospects remain attractive, supported by strong AI momentum and enterprise customer growth, current valuation levels warrant caution. Trading at an EV/EBITDA of 31.77x versus the industry average of 7.88x suggests limited near-term upside potential. For investors interested in the stock, a prudent approach would be to wait for valuation multiples to normalize, monitor quarterly execution and consider gradual position building through dollar-cost averaging. Though the company's market position and AI-driven strategy remain compelling, the premium valuation combined with market uncertainties makes waiting for a better entry point in 2025 a sensible strategy.

(NASDAQ:FIVN) Trading At A 46% Discount? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 2:02 PM 6 min read In This Article: FIVN -1.22% Key Insights Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Five9 fair value estimate is US$69.25 Current share price of US$37.39 suggests Five9 is potentially 46% undervalued The US$52.87 analyst price target for FIVN is 24% less than our estimate of fair value In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Five9, Inc. ( NASDAQ:FIVN ) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple! Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model . See our latest analysis for Five9 Is Five9 Fairly Valued? We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$150.3m US$190.4m US$227.4m US$260.1m US$288.3m US$312.5m US$333.2m US$351.4m US$367.5m US$382.3m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x3 Est @ 26.63% Est @ 19.42% Est @ 14.38% Est @ 10.85% Est @ 8.38% Est @ 6.65% Est @ 5.44% Est @ 4.60% Est @ 4.00% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.0% US$139 US$163 US$181 US$191 US$196 US$197 US$195 US$190 US$184 US$177 (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.8b We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.6%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.0%. Story Continues Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$382m\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (8.0%\u2013 2.6%) = US$7.3b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = US$7.3b\u00f7 ( 1 + 8.0%) 10 = US$3.4b The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$5.2b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$37.4, the company appears quite undervalued at a 46% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. NasdaqGM:FIVN Discounted Cash Flow January 21st 2025 The Assumptions Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Five9 as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.302. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for Five9 Strength Net debt to equity ratio below 40%. Weakness No major weaknesses identified for FIVN. Opportunity Forecast to reduce losses next year. Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows. Good value based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value. Threat Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow. Looking Ahead: Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Five9, we've compiled three essential aspects you should consider: Risks : Every company has them, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Five9 you should know about. Management :Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for FIVN's future outlook?

Buy? Zacks Equity Research Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 4:56 PM 6 min read In This Article: NTAP -1.95% NetApp \u2019s NTAP shares have proven resilient, with a 37.8% gain in the past year, outpacing the industry\u2019s growth of 10.7%. NetApp provides enterprise storage as well as data management software and hardware products and services. It has also outperformed the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500 composite\u2019s growth of 27.8% and 24.8%, respectively. Closing at $122.09 in the last trading session, NTAP stock is currently trading 9.9% below its 52-week high of $135.45, attained on Nov. 22, 2024. Price Performance Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research With the pullback from 52-week high along with strong business momentum, is NTAP an attractive investment opportunity? Let us discuss NTAP\u2019s prospects and ascertain how to strategize investment. NTAP\u2019s Flash & Public Cloud Business Key Drivers NetApp is witnessing higher demand from customers for its portfolio of modern all-flash arrays, especially the C-series capacity flash and ASA block-optimized flash. The new all-flash A-series is also picking up momentum. These enterprise storage products will allow users to boost workloads including traditional enterprise applications and Gen AI. The company expects the new AFF A-series, along with its C-series and ASA products, to capture further share in the all-flash market. In the fiscal second quarter, the company\u2019s All-Flash Array Business\u2019s annualized net revenue run rate was $3.8 billion, up 19% year over year. Total billings rose 9% year over year to $1.59 billion. Also, Keystone\u2019s storage-as-a-service offering has been gaining significant traction, with revenues increasing more than 55% year over year in the fiscal second quarter. Unbilled RPO was $330 million, up 11% quarter over quarter. Unbilled RPO is a key indicator of Keystone's growth. Solid momentum in hyperscaler first-party and marketplace storage services has been driving revenues from the Public Cloud. The Public Cloud segment comprises revenues from products delivered as a service and related supports. The portfolio contains cloud automation and optimization services, storage and cloud infrastructure monitoring services. Public Cloud segment\u2019s revenues improved 9% to $168 million, driven by 43% increase in first-party and marketplace cloud storage services. Driven by strength in the cloud storage business, NetApp now expects cloud revenues to return to double-digit growth year over year from the current quarter. NTAP Raises Outlook Driven by strong year-to-date performance and strength in flash, block, cloud and AI, NetApp now expects full-year revenues in the range of $6.54-$6.74 billion, up 6% year over year at the mid-point. Earlier it anticipated sales in the band of $6.48-$6.68 billion. The company now forecasts non-GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2025 to be between $7.20 and $7.40, up 13% year over year at the mid-point. Earlier, it expected non-GAAP earnings between $7 and $7.20 per share. For fiscal 2025, NetApp continues to expect non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 71-72%. Non-GAAP operating margin is anticipated in the band of 28-28.5% compared with 27-28%. NetApp recently inked a definitive agreement to divest its Spot by NetApp FinOps business to Flexera, a global technology spend and risk management player. NetApp acquired cloud services startup \u2013\u2013 Spot \u2013\u2013 in July 2020.\u00a0 The divesture aligns seamlessly with NetApp\u2019s vision of fostering long-term growth and innovation in the intelligent data infrastructure. While the financial details of the transaction remain undisclosed, the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Story Continues AI Momentum Long-term Growth Driver for NTAP Apart from the demand for flash and block, increasing demand for NetApp\u2019s cloud storage and AI solutions bodes well. In the fiscal second quarter, the company won more than 100 AI and data lake modernization deals. The company is also working on the development of GenAI cloud and on-premises solutions in collaboration with industry behemoths. NetApp expanded its partnership with Google Cloud to provide the foundational data storage for the Google Distributed Cloud and make AI-ready infrastructure available to the public sector and other highly regulated industries. NetApp's intelligent data infrastructure, bolstered by ONTAP and StorageGRID solutions, empowers its customers to efficiently scale workloads and harness AI while ensuring security and regulatory compliance. Google Distributed Cloud will also use these capabilities to enhance its services, including databases, AI and analytics. NTAP\u2019s Healthy Capital Allocation Strategy Management\u2019s execution has been favorable in recent times. NetApp\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and investments was $2.22 billion while long-term debt was $1.244 billion as of Oct. 25, 2024. For the fiscal second quarter, the company generated net cash from operations was $105 million and free cash flow was $60 million. Net cash balance provides the required flexibility to pursue any growth strategy, whether through acquisitions or otherwise. A strong balance sheet helps NetApp to continue its shareholder-friendly initiatives of dividend payouts. The company returned $406 million to its shareholders as dividend payouts and share repurchases in the last reported quarter. The company has $800 million worth of shares remaining under its existing authorization. NetApp also announced a dividend of 52 cents per share payable on Jan. 22, 2025, to its shareholders of record as of the close of business on Jan. 3.

Upgraded to Buy: What Does It Mean for the Stock? Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 8:00 PM 3 min read In This Article: FIVN -1.22% Investors might want to bet on Five9 (FIVN), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change. The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system. The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Five9 basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price. Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock. For Five9, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher. Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>. Story Continues Earnings Estimate Revisions for Five9 This provider of cloud-based software to call centers is expected to earn $2.37 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2024, which represents a year-over-year change of 15.6%. Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Five9. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 568.5%. Bottom Line Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term. You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>> The upgrade of Five9 to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Five9, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:FIVN) stands against the other AI stocks. Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2025 revolved around AI. If not, it\u2019s all that exhibitors could show. Talking about the highlight of the show, it was undoubtedly the keynote from Jensen Huang. The keynote included new products to advance gaming, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and agentic AI. Huang kicked off his talk by reflecting on the company\u2019s 3-decade journey. Later on, he highlighted several significant advancements. Takeaways From CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s Keynote at CES 2025 As per Huang, AI has been advancing at an \u2018incredible pace.\u2019 It started with perception AI, meaning understanding images, words, and sounds. Then it came to generative AI, meaning creating text, images, and sound. And now, it\u2019s the era of physical AI, meaning AI that can proceed, reason, plan, and act.\u00a0The AI giant introduced GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, which are powered by Blackwell architecture. These GPUs provide significant improvements in AI-driven rendering, enhancing gaming and creative workflows. Furthermore, Huang unveiled \u201cCosmos,\u201d which is a suite of foundational AI models capable of generating photorealistic video. The models have been designed in such a way that train robots and automated systems more efficiently, further advancing robotics and autonomous technologies. The company and its partners have rolled out AI Blueprints for agentic AI, which includes PDF-to-podcast for efficient research and video search and summarization for assessing significant quantities of video and images \u2014 allowing developers to build, test, and run AI agents anywhere. Agentic AI- Road Ahead in 2025 TechInformed interviewed experts from leading technology companies to explore predictions about Agentic AI. As per Steven Webb, UK chief technology and innovation officer, Capgemini, 2025 will see wider adoption of small language models (SLMs) and AI agents as an era of Agentic AI is fast approaching. Using multiple SLMs throughout a toolchain is expected to play a critical role in the AI evolution. This will include going beyond the already familiar LLMs such as GPT. Furthermore, Alan Jacobson (chief data and analytics officer at Alteryx) believes that 2025 will see the rise of Gen AI agents used to solve problems. This is an approach that is made possible by reducing costs and improving the performance and speed of LLMs. Frameworks for orchestrating Agentic AI work are expected to emerge. Notably, a large percentage of use cases are expected to start to employ this approach.

Morgan Stanley Raises Five9 (FIVN) Price Target to $46, Citing AI Growth and Strong Q3 Results An IT engineer working on a laptop as planograms for a cloud-based virtual contact center platform appear on the monitor. Five9, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ: FIVN ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29 Average Upside Potential: 32.6% Five9, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:FIVN) uses AI to revolutionize customer service operations and improve agent productivity. It integrates AI across its platform to automate processes, offers intelligent insights, and provides personalized customer experiences. Five9, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:FIVN) has been investing in AI solutions, which is expected to be a significant opportunity if adoption increases. The company\u2019s AI offerings are the strong contenders in the market. Its focus on AI aligns with broader industry trends that focus more on intelligent and automated customer service solutions. As businesses focus on automation and enhancing their customer service operations, AI-powered contact center solutions are expected to be more valuable. Five9, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:FIVN)\u2019s strong AI offerings place it well to capitalize on this growing trend. If the company can establish itself as a leader in AI-powered CCaaS solutions, it can fuel significant growth and gain a competitive edge. Moreover, AI solutions often command higher price points that can result in increased customer stickiness, potentially improving revenue growth and customer retention rates. Brown Capital Management , an investment management company, released its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: \u201cFive9, Inc. (NASDAQ:FIVN) is a leader in cloud-based contact-center software, which serves as the routing engine to connect callers to agents. With the growth of e-commerce, consumers are making fewer in-person visits to stores but contacting companies more frequently, driving the need for world-class contact-center software solutions like Five9\u2019s. It has been a tough couple of years for Five9\u2019s stock and this quarter provided no relief. Competitive concerns, questions about AI\u2019s long-term impact on the business and deteriorating macroeconomic conditions have all cast clouds over the company\u2019s stock. Five9\u2019s consumer segment, one of its largest divisions, has really struggled of late as clients hire fewer call-center agents, pressuring Five9\u2019s seat-based revenue model. Total revenue growth decelerated to 13% year-over-year in the most recent quarter, down from 28% and 17% in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Moreover, management guided to 16% for the full year 2024, which some consider optimistic given the weak start to the year. These worsening sales trends further weighed on shares during the quarter. Overall FIVN ranks 11th on our list of the best AI stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of FIVN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

CRM -0.72% The risks are undeniable. After two years of impressive gains, the software sector could easily take a breather. But analysts aren\u2019t betting on it. \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb8 Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb8 Bank of America analysts revealed that although the U.S. software market grew 59% in 2023 and 23% in 2024, development projections still run below historical averages. \"Revenue multiples and growth expectations remain below 5-year median and pre-Covid levels,\u201d Bank of America said in its Jan. 14 report, pointing to the potential of three secular themes for 2025: Agentic AI, growing enterprise IT budgets, and sustained cloud migration. Salesforce's CEO Marc Benioff believes Agentic AI is a bold leap in the future of work.Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images Three growth themes explained Agentic AI refers to AI systems that can learn, act, and make decisions autonomously, without constant human input. Bank of America sees it as a key differentiator for software companies. \u201cAgentic AI deployments could displace workers as early as 2H25 across industries, such as contact centers, software engineering and marketing,\u201d the firm noted. Related: Analyst picks Microsoft as best stock to play AI spending surge in 2025 The second key trend is accelerated enterprise IT spending, which is expected to gather pace through 2026. Tech heavyweights like Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon are spending heavily on AI and will likely expand their investments in 2025. \u201cDemand continues to be higher than our available capacity,\u201d Amy Hood, Microsoft\u2019s finance chief, said during the company's earnings call last October. Moreover, sustained cloud migration remains a key growth driver for the software sector as optimization headwinds ease, Bank of America said. \"Although we remain selective on small caps, we are bullish on the software sector for 2025, particularly in 2H, as accelerating secular tailwinds and easing cyclical headwinds converge,\" the firm added. So, who could be the winners in this gold rush? Bank of America has its bets. Bank of America names Salesforce as its top pick for 2025 Bank of America sees potential for positive returns in undervalued names within subsectors like CRM (customer relationship management) and Infrastructure, which the firm identifies as particularly well-positioned for growth in 2025. Related: Analysts reveal AI stock picks for 2025, including Palantir The firm has named Salesforce ( CRM ) one of its top buys this year, alongside HubSpot ( HUBS ) , Microsoft ( MSFT ) , ServiceNow ( NOW ) , Datadog ( DDOG ) , GitLab ( GTLB ) , Global-e Online ( GLBE ) , Five9 ( FIVN ) , Monday.com ( MNDY ) , and Asana ( ASAN ) . Story Continues Salesforce is often seen as the leader in leveraging AI to enhance customer relationship management, and BofA calls it a \"leading front office Agentic AI play.\" Salesforce unveiled Agentforce 2.0 on Dec.17, which is its latest digital labor platform that can autonomously provide customer support without preprogrammed responses. Agentforce's clients include IBM ( IBM ) , Finnair, Accenture ( ACN ) , and Heathrow Airport. They are using the platform to augment their teams, streamline operations, and unlock new growth opportunities. Salesforce reported fiscal third-quarter results on Dec. 3. Revenue surpassed Wall Street's expectations, but earnings fell slightly short. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.41, slightly missing Wall Street\u2019s expectation of $2.44. Revenue grew 8% year-over-year to $9.44 billion, beating the $9.34 billion consensus estimate. The company also raised the low end of its fiscal 2025 revenue guidance, now expecting $37.8 billion to $38 billion. This caused Salesforce's stock price to surge 11% on the next trading day following the earnings. Salesforce's chief executive Marc Benioff highlighted the company's momentum in artificial intelligence, particularly the Agentforce platform. \u201cThis is a bold leap in the future of work, where AI agents let humans unite to transform all of our customer interactions,\u201d Benioff said. Salesforce positioned for $80 AI-driven upside, Wedbush said Investment firm Wedbush is also positive about Salesforce stock into 2025. The firm is generally bullish in the broader software sector and has highlighted Salesforce as one of the biggest potential winners, along with Palantir ( PLTR ) . \"We believe CRM is a clear 2nd derivative beneficiary of the AI Revolution that could add ~$80 per share to the CRM story as this monetization story takes shape over the next 12 to 18 months,\" Wedbush's analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a December report.

Here are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog: 5 Little-Known Tech Stocks Focused on AI Data Center, IoT and 5G Wall Street has been suffering from severe volatility since the beginning of 2025 after two consecutive years of an impressive bull run. The technology sector has suffered the most in this volatility as this space was the major beneficiary of the last two years\u2019 rally. A large section of economists and financial experts have raised concerns about the highly valued technology sector, especially against the backdrop of investors\u2019 discomfort about the Fed\u2019s trajectory of interest rate cut in 2025.

Within this space, artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing and data center, the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G wireless technologies are receiving massive market traction.

"Buy 5 Little-Known Tech Stocks Focusing on AI, Data Center, IoT and 5G Nalak Das Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 10:00 PM 7 min read In This Article: FSLY -2.67% INOD -0.92% ^GSPC -0.76% JBL -1.80% FIVN -1.22% Key Takeaways Besides AI, tech stocks focusing on cloud computing, data centers, 5G and IoT are seeing market traction. Mid-size and small companies such as UiPath Inc., Fastly Inc. and Innodata Inc. are building stock momentum. These little-known stocks have strong revenue growth, as well as positive earnings estimate revisions. Wall Street has been suffering from severe volatility since the beginning of 2025 after two consecutive years of an impressive bull run. The technology sector has suffered the most in this volatility as this space was the major beneficiary of the last two years\u2019 rally. A large section of economists and financial experts have raised concerns about the highly valued technology sector, especially against the backdrop of investors\u2019 discomfort about the Fed\u2019s trajectory of interest rate cut in 2025. Nevertheless, the technology sector will remain buoyant in the long term supported by its relentless innovative power. No other sector evolves as frequently as technology. Within this space, artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing and data center, the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G wireless technologies are receiving massive market traction. At this stage, it will be prudent to invest in small and mid-sized stocks focused on the above-mentioned areas. Five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank are: UiPath Inc. PATH, Five9 Inc. FIVN, Innodata Inc. INOD, Fastly Inc. FSLY and Jabil Inc. JBL. U.S. Economy Remains Robust The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain rock solid as revealed by the resilient labor market data of December. Robust job additions, reduction in unemployment rate, steady wage growth and lower weekly jobless claims bode well for the economy. Additionally, strong holiday retail sales, a robust services sector PMI, and improvement in manufacturing PMI and durable goods orders reflect a strong economy. A solid Main Street will support the Wall Street rally despite sticky inflation and short-term fluctuations. 5 Small and Mid-Sized AI Stocks to Buy for 2025 These little-known stocks have strong earnings and revenue growth potential for 2025.

Stock Despite 20% Decline Over the Past Year? Zacks Equity Research Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 9:33 PM 3 min read In This Article: NICE -2.00% NICE Ltd. NICE shares have fallen 20.4% over the past year, lagging the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s return of 29.3% and the Zacks Internet \u2013 Software industry\u2019s growth of 30.6%. NICE\u2019s negative share price movement has been led by the consistent decline in service revenue over the past few quarters due to the ongoing transition to cloud-based services. Product revenues have displayed volatility, indicating challenges such as fluctuating demand and increasing competition. These factors are expected to hurt segmental sales in the near term. Despite the challenges, the company is expected to benefit from continued growth in the cloud business and AI domain, driven by platform innovation and a growing client base. Stiff Competition Hurts NICE\u2019s Prospects NICE faces stiff competition in the Customer Engagement and Financial Crime and Compliance business segments. Nice Price and Consensus Nice Price and Consensus Nice price-consensus-chart | Nice Quote Customer Engagement offerings include transformative solutions like CXone that enhance consumer experiences and transform processes in Public Safety and Criminal Justice through digital innovation. In this segment, NICE competes with companies like Aspect, Calabrio, Genesys and Verint Systems VRNT in the Workforce Optimization market. In the Contact Center as a Service market, which continues to be dominated by traditional on-premises providers, NICE faces stiff competition from key players such as Avaya, Cisco Systems CSCO, Five9 FIVN, TalkDesk and a variety of niche vendors. The Financial Crime and Compliance market provides solutions like X-Sight and Xceed to help financial organizations and digital banks manage risks, prevent fraud and ensure compliance in real time. Key competitors in this space include BAE Systems, FICO, NASDAQ Smarts, Oracle and SAS Institute. These competitors offer both specialized and comprehensive solutions to address financial crime risks. NICE\u2019s Expanding AI Platform Aids Clientele Growth NICE launched CXone Mpower to drive end-to-end automation in customer service by leveraging AI advancements. Through its CXone platform, the company is enhancing customer engagement with new products, growth and acquisitions, improving self-service and delivering digital solutions tailored to customer needs. The adoption of AI solutions, including Autopilot, CSAT and Copilot, has significantly boosted NICE's performance by enhancing customer engagement and automating services. The company leads in AI-driven solutions for customer experiences, financial crime and digital policing transformation. It monitors 5 billion transactions daily, safeguarding $6 trillion and serving the top 10 global banks. With a $5-billion TAM projected by 2028, NICE is poised for growth by advancing its X-Sight platform and expanding cloud solutions for high-end clients. The company has significantly expanded its partner ecosystem, adding more than 40 partners, including 20 international partners, which is expected to drive growth. NICE secured more than 100 large enterprise accounts year to date, displacing legacy on-premise competitors and attracting more than 45 leading brands after failed deployments from other cloud vendors. The company's presence in above 150 countries and its engagement with more than 85% of Fortune 100 customers provide a solid foundation for continued international expansion. Story Continues NICE\u2019s Earnings & Sales Estimates Trend Upward For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.90 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. This indicates year-over-year growth of 12.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $721.31 million, suggesting a 9.4% increase from the prior-year quarter\u2019s actual.

2025, 4:46 PM 1 min read In This Article: MSFT -1.00% CRM -0.72% NOW +0.25% HUBS -1.87% BAC -0.19% Pointing to major potential in the industry despite recent gains, Bank of America lists Salesforce ( NYSE:CRM ), HubSpot ( NYSE:HUBS ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), and ServiceNow ( NYSE:NOW ) as top software picks for 2025. Though the U.S. software market grew 59% in 2023 and 23% in 2024, development projections still fall short of historical averages. The company forecasts more upside from Agentic AI's proliferation, higher business IT spending, and continuous cloud adoption. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with CRM. While HubSpot gains from a boom in small and medium-sized business activities, Salesforce leads in combining this technology into front-office processes.Using AI developments in infrastructure and applications, Microsoft gains an advantage; ServiceNow keeps great momentum using its cloud and back-office systems. Other noteworthy references are Datadog ( NASDAQ:DDOG ), for its observability, GitLab ( NASDAQ:GTLB ), for its DevOps breakthroughs, and Global E-Online ( NASDAQ:GLBE ), a leader in cross-border e-commerce. With more effective measurements and more market possibilities, five 9 ( NASDAQ:FIVN ), Monday.com ( NASDAQ:MNDY ), and Asana ( NYSE:ASAN ) also indicate upside potential ahead.

(NASDAQ:FIVN): Redefining Customer Engagement with AI-Powered Cloud Contact Center Solutions Maham Fatima Mon, Jan 6, 2025, 11:58 PM 6 min read In This Article: FIVN -1.22% We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks Under $50 According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Five9 Inc. (NASDAQ:FIVN) stands against the other AI stocks under $50. Franklin Mutual's Katrina Dudley appeared on CNBC on December 31 to discuss whether the sectors that powered the market's gains in 2024 will continue to lead the way in 2025, particularly AI within the tech and communications sectors. Companies in these sectors, especially the MAG7 stocks, have experienced remarkable performance over the past year. She pointed out that alongside traditional tech stocks, companies providing essential infrastructure are crucial for supporting the rapid expansion of AI technologies. She expressed strong optimism about AI's continued influence, stating that it represents a secular theme likely to propel the tech sector forward in the coming year. When addressing concerns about market valuations, Dudley reiterated that high valuations, such as the S&P 500 trading at ~22 times earnings, should not deter investors. Instead, she argued that these valuations reflect robust earnings growth among technology companies, distinguishing this phase from past market bubbles. The network effects inherent in AI-driven companies contribute to their returns, suggesting that if these firms can exceed earnings expectations, their valuations could become more favorable over time. However, she cautioned that consistent performance is critical. Any failure to deliver on earnings growth could pose risks in a high-valuation environment. Turning her attention to lagging sectors, Dudley discussed healthcare as an area ripe for AI-driven transformation. She noted that while healthcare has significant upside potential due to demographic trends, some healthcare service providers faced challenges in 2024 due to rising costs and consumer pushback against high pricing. The increased focus on transparency in healthcare pricing may benefit consumers but could complicate profitability for companies. She suggested that advancements in AI technology are enhancing productivity within pharmaceutical research and development. Although immediate benefits may not be visible, she believes that AI's long-term impact on productivity will make healthcare an increasingly attractive sector for investment. Dudley's insights underscore the transformative potential of AI across both tech and healthcare sectors.
