[{"text": "1 Growth Stock Down 75% to Buy Right Now Will Healy, The Motley Fool Sun, Jan 26, 2025, 3:30 PM 4 min read In This Article: CELH Celsius (NASDAQ: CELH) has prospered under the leadership of John Fieldy. Since he became CEO in April 2018, the energy drink company's stock has soared by more than 6,300% at its peak. Nonetheless, the stock has lost 75% from its 2024 high amid lower purchases by a key distributor. While the purchasing slowdown may be temporary, it left investors questioning the stock's future growth prospects. Still, instead of assuming Celsius's growth story is over, investors have good reason to see the pullback as a buying opportunity in the beverage stock . Here's why. The state of Celsius Celsius is currently the third-most popular energy drink in the U.S., lagging behind Red Bull and Monster . It stood out from competitors by taking a nature-based approach, emphasizing medical research on its product, and touting its health benefits. That angle helped it develop a following with the fitness community. However, it was a distribution deal with PepsiCo that supercharged the stock beginning in 2022. This led to an investment from PepsiCo and a move that gave it valuable shelf space across numerous retail outlets. With that, revenue growth was up more than double in both 2022 and 2023. Unfortunately, a purchasing disruption with a major distributor (most likely PepsiCo) led to the recent stock pullback. The distributor slowed its purchases, causing Celsius's red-hot revenue growth to reverse course by the third quarter of 2024 as sales growth at the retail level began to slow. Fear and hope amid the slowdown The severity of the slowdown is stark. In the third quarter of 2024, revenue totaled $266 million, down 31% from the year-ago period. As indicated, this stands in contrast to the 104% yearly revenue growth in the third quarter of 2023. Indeed, the state of the market likely forced its distributor to adjust its purchasing levels. According to market research firm Circana, sales at the retail level increased by just 7% annually in the third quarter of 2024 over the last 13 weeks, an indication that consumers had cut spending on energy drinks. This stands in stark contrast to the year-ago quarter, when retail sales grew at 161% annually. Moreover, since selling, general, and administrative expenses ramped up during Q3 2024, net income dropped to just $8 million versus $105 million in the third quarter of 2023. Still, investors should put this situation into perspective. Sales in the U.S. continue to increase, and the distributor will likely right-size its inventory, making another such slowdown unlikely. Also, the company's outlook may not appear as bleak as the sales slowdown might imply. International sales grew 37% yearly in the third quarter. Admittedly, only 7% of company revenue comes from outside North America. Nonetheless, if it can increase its distribution in Europe and Asia as it did in the U.S., it could bring back the rapid growth that took its stock higher in past years. Story Continues Additionally, its\u00a0price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 35, and the fact that its forward P/E ratio is 27 implies a likely recovery in profit levels. If the company can reinvigorate growth, the valuation will likely not stay this low for long. Consider Celsius stock Following its 75% drop, the stock is probably offering investors a unique buying opportunity. Indeed, Celsius presents some risk at these levels. The slowing of product sales to single digits from the triple-digit increases from the year-ago quarter could discourage stock buying. However, it continues to increase its proportion of international sales, and this part of the revenue stream continues to grow at a rapid clip. When considering Celsius' comparatively low valuation, today's price might be seen as an excellent buying opportunity in the future.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our 9 Best Market-Beating Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Plunge? Jon Quast, The Motley Fool Sun, Jan 26, 2025, 1:52 PM 5 min read In This Article: CELH Move over Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH) , there's a new growth story in the energy drink space. Alani Nu is an energy drink with similar branding to Celsius that only launched in 2018. And it's clear that the latter is outgrowing Celsius (and others) by a mile. Alani Nu is owned by privately held Congo Brands, which means that retail investors don't have access to precise and up-to-date numbers from the company. But there have been peeks behind the curtain every now and then. For example, Alani Nu is headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, and Louisville Business First listed it among the fastest-growing businesses in the area. According to this publication, Alani Nu grew revenue by an astounding 271% in 2021, reaching $228 million. For perspective, 2021 was a great year for Celsius as well, but it wasn't as good as it was for Alani Nu. For its part, Celsius' revenue was up 140% to $314 million. In short, Alani Nu took more market share than Celsius in 2021. Unfortunately for Celsius' investors, it seems this trend has continued. Again, precise numbers are hard to come by. But in Celsius' own investor presentations, Alani Nu is seen as a fast-growing brand. In the first quarter of 2024, Celsius estimated Alani Nu's market share at 2.9%. In Q3, Celsius estimated Alani Nu's market share at 3.5%. The emergence of Alani Nu has investors worried for Celsius. In fact, professional analyst Robert Moscow from TD Cowen downgraded his outlook for Celsius stock specifically citing competitive pressures from Alani Nu, according to Seeking Alpha. And while it would be too much to say that this is the only factor involved, it's clear that this partly explains why Celsius stock has plunged 74% from its all-time high -- the competition is gaining. Be that as it may, I believe it's premature to abandon Celsius stock simply because of competition from Alani Nu and others. Celsius has some under-appreciated strengths that can help it win this game. What Celsius has going for it It's important to mention that according to the same investor presentations I cited earlier, Celsius is also gaining market share in the energy drink space. According to the company, from Q1 to Q3 its market share went from 11.4% to 12.1%, which is a meaningful jump. Therefore, Alani Nu is rising fast. But it seems to be rising more at the expense of other players in the space and not so much at the expense of Celsius. Here's another thing to remember: Celsius has grown into quite a financial powerhouse that's capable of defending itself. The company has more than $900 million in cash and cash equivalents and zero debt. And through the first three quarters of 2024, it earned $164 million in net income. Story Continues A business's financial position isn't everything. But having a strong financial position, as Celsius does, certainly helps in times of heightened competition. Financially stronger companies can spend more to keep and acquire customers, can sustain longer periods of pressure on profit margins, and more. Finally, part of Celsius' robust cash position is due to an equity investment from PepsiCo . Yes, Pepsi is an investor in Celsius, giving it a vested interest in the success of this energy-drink company. For this reason, I find it unlikely that Pepsi would allow smaller, upstart companies to simply waltz in and take Celsius down. To summarize, Celsius is still taking market share, it's in a position of financial strength, and it has beverage titan Pepsi on its team. To me, this suggests that Celsius will be just fine for years to come. What this means for investors If fears about Celsius' future are overblown, that's where things get interesting for investors. Right now, the stock has dropped considerably, as mentioned. And it now trades at a much lower valuation. In fact, from a price-to-sales perspective, Celsius stock is 36% cheaper than larger rival Monster . And Celsius stock is more than 50% cheaper than its 10-year average valuation. CELH PS Ratio data by YCharts Without going into detail, I believe Celsius still has many years of growth potential before it. It's still a relatively small player with opportunities it can exploit. If it does indeed continue on a growth trajectory, then Celsius stock is quite the bargain today for long-term investors. For what it's worth, I believe this will ultimately be the case for Celsius stock. While competition is real, the company is still in a good spot to grow long term. And in light of this, the stock is a great value for those who buy today.

This Article: RELY CELH PEP It paid to bet on hypergrowth stocks in 2024. As the page turns to 2025, what will the market have in store for investors in these fast-moving companies? While I have no clue whether artificial intelligence (AI) focused stocks will do well again this year, I do know that expectations have risen for these companies and that they mostly trade at nosebleed valuations. Perhaps it is time for growth investors to change their gaze and look for other growth stocks to buy in 2025. I think these two hypergrowth stocks -- one beaten down and one just beginning a share price turnaround -- can make investors rich if they buy in 2025 and hold on for the long term. Here's why Remitly Global (NASDAQ: RELY) and Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH) are buys for your portfolio in 2025. 1. Celsius: Primed for an energy drink comeback The start of 2024 looked promising for Celsius and its upstart energy drink brand. Revenue growth was close to 100% in the fourth quarter of 2023, leading to a new all-time high for its share price. Then, revenue began a massive slowdown. Celsius stock is now in a 75% drawdown 12 months later. Last quarter, the third quarter of 2024, revenue fell 31% year over year. Why did this happen? One major factor explains it above all else. A few years back, PepsiCo made a large investment in Celsius. In return, Celsius was able to hop on the Pepsi distribution network in North America, which helped the energy drink brand get on more shelves in retail locations across the United States. This helped supercharge Celsius' growth and market share gains in the United States. However, in late 2023 Pepsi began to over-order Celsius inventory to try to catch up with customer demand, which caused a revenue growth acceleration for Celsius. Now, Celsius is in the midst of this inventory hangover. Even though Celsius end-market demand is growing, the company is reporting negative revenue growth as Pepsi balances inventory levels. This is obviously frustrating for shareholders, but it has no bearing on the popularity of Celsius beverages among consumers. Healthier energy drinks that are sugar-free are taking market share in the sector, with Celsius leading the way. It now has around 12% market share of the energy drink category in the United States and is expanding to new international markets. Over the next few quarters, Celsius will finally get to the other side of this Pepsi inventory debacle. Once that occurs, revenue growth will flip back to positive, and I think the stock will get back on an upward trajectory. At its current stock price, the stock has a market cap of $6 billion. Even with this Pepsi revenue hole, trailing revenue was $1.37 billion over the past 12 months. I think it can get to around $2 billion in a few years with international expansion, pricing power, and market share gains in the energy drink category. Story Continues 2. Remitly Global: Taking market share in remittance payments The second stock has a more attractive chart than Celsius Holdings. Remitly Global is up 75% in the last six months, but the stock is still down 50% from all-time highs set in 2021. Remitly Global is a modern remittance company. Remittances are a transfer of money across borders, historically dominated by cash pick-up options such as Western Union . Remitly has attacked this market with a sleek mobile application that gives remittance senders and receivers a plethora of options for sending money abroad. It focuses on key immigrant populations in the United States and have many people sending money to family back home. Over the last decade, Remitly has consistently taken market share from Western Union with lower fees and a better customer experience. In the last three years, Remitly's revenue rose 134% cumulatively while Western Union's is down 16.2%. I would expect this to continue with Remitly gaining market share in the United States and increasingly new markets around the world. Last quarter, Remitly's send volume grew 42% to $14.5 billion, active customers grew 35% to 7.3 million, and revenue grew 39% year over year to $336.5 million. Even so, the company estimates it is only at 3% market share of remittances. There is plenty of room for Remitly to grow all these metrics in the years to come. With positive operating margins,\u00a0Remitly looks like a great buy and hold for investors in 2025. The growth party for this stock is just getting started. Investors should note that these two stocks look promising, but are not guaranteed to work in 2025. There could be a bear market crash or a change in their respective industries. When looking at high-growth stocks you will inherently be investing in riskier companies. Keep this in mind when sizing up these positions for your portfolio.

(CELH) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It Zacks Equity Research Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 5:00 PM 5 min read In This Article: CELH Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock. Shares of this company have returned -7.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.7% change. The Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry, to which Celsius belongs, has lost 4.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Earnings Estimate Revisions Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, Celsius is expected to post earnings of $0.12 per share, indicating a change of -29.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days. The consensus earnings estimate of $0.68 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -11.7%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.92 indicates a change of +34.9% from what Celsius is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Celsius. Story Continues The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: 12 Month EPS Revenue Growth Forecast While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth. For Celsius, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $332.7 million indicates a year-over-year change of -4.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $1.35 billion and $1.57 billion estimates indicate +2.7% and +16% changes, respectively. Last Reported Results and Surprise History Celsius reported revenues of $265.75 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -30.9%. EPS of $0 for the same period compares with $0.30 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $266.13 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.14%. The EPS surprise was -100%. Over the last four quarters, Celsius surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period. Valuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance. Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is. The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Celsius is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. Bottom Line The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Celsius. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Going to $42? 1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks So. John Ballard, The Motley Fool Sat, Jan 25, 2025, 7:00 PM 3 min read In This Article: CELH Shares of Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH) are currently trading 73% off their all-time high. Lower sales are to blame as its largest distributor made inventory adjustments that weighed on Celsius' financial results last year. In the wake of new sales and market share data, Morgan Stanley is maintaining its equal weight (hold) rating on the shares and also keeping its price target at $42, which implies upside of 66% from where the stock trades as of this writing. Wall Street price targets are usually estimates of where an analyst thinks the stock will trade within the next 12 to 18 months. It's uncertain when the stock will recover, but Celsius is emerging as a leading brand in an industry with excellent long-term growth prospects. Celsius is still on track for monster growth The firm noted data from Nielsen that showed the most recent week's sales down 6% year over year. Importantly, Celsius' market-share position appears to be holding fairly steady with a 80 basis-point decline from the year-ago period. Celsius has capitalized on its position as a \"better-for-you\" energy drink option made with no sugar and natural ingredients. The company noted its market share increased to 11.6% in October as it emerges as a growth leader in the energy category. It's got a bright future with per capita spending on energy drinks expected to grow significantly in the coming years. Celsius can recover when the economy is stronger, but the timing is difficult to predict. The global energy drink market is expected to increase by $47 billion in value to reach $240 billion by 2027. That's a huge opportunity for Celsius with its annual revenue of just $1.4 billion. Last March, investors were paying over 100 times earnings for Celsius stock. Now, shares fetch a reasonable forward earnings multiple of 27, putting investors in a better position to realize solid long-term returns moving forward.
