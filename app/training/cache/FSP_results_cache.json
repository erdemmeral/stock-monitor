Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 8:05 AM 19 min read Many Americans have long struggled to build savings. However, high inflation and interest rates since the COVID-19 pandemic have made it even more difficult for people to save for emergencies. Only around 2 in 5 (41 percent) Americans would use their savings to pay for a major unexpected expense, such as $1,000 for an emergency room visit or car repair, according to a new Bankrate poll. That\u2019s down from 44 percent a year ago. Instead of reaching for their savings, other people would pay for a $1,000 unexpected expense by financing it with a credit card they\u2019d pay off over time, reducing their spending on other things, taking out a personal loan, borrowing from family or friends or other methods. This data comes from Bankrate\u2019s yearly Emergency Savings Report, an exclusive survey-based report conducted by Bankrate and polling partner SSRS. Since 2014, the survey has annually polled 1,000+ U.S. adults about their levels of debt and emergency savings. The most recent data, polled in December 2024, specifically examines what\u2019s causing people to save less and how people would feel about affording their living expenses in case of a loss of income. In the last several years, Americans have reckoned with a number of economic headwinds, from high inflation to a slowing job market. Now, 73 percent of Americans say they\u2019re saving less for unexpected expenses due to inflation/rising prices, elevated interest rates or a change in income or employment status. It\u2019s unclear how the economy will continue to affect Americans\u2019 savings in 2025. On the positive side, inflation has slowed significantly since peaking in 2022. But the inflation rate is still above the Federal Reserve\u2019s target, leading the Federal Reserve to continue slowing the economy by keeping its federal funds rate higher for longer. What\u2019s more, economists expect the unemployment rate to reach 4.4 percent by December 2025. Bankrate\u2019s insights on emergency funds and personal savings Fewer Americans year-over-year would pay for emergencies out of savings 41% of U.S. adults would use their savings to pay for an unexpected emergency expense (such as $1,000 for an emergency room visit or car repair). This is down from 44% in 2024. Even more Americans would borrow money to pay for an emergency 43% of U.S. adults would pay for an unexpected emergency expense (such as $1,000 for an emergency room visit or car repair) by borrowing money in some form. That includes 25% of people who would use a credit card and pay it off over time, up from 21% in 2024. Americans increasingly have no savings at all 27% of U.S. adults have no emergency savings, as of May 2024 polling \u2014 the highest percentage since 2020.

This is down from 44 percent in 2024, and after three years of progress, this is the lowest the percentage has been since 2021, when it was 39 percent: Source: Bankrate Emergency Savings Surveys Note: Not all percentages total 100 due to rounding. Another 25 percent of people would use a credit card to pay for an unexpected $1,000 emergency expense and pay it off over time, up from 21 percent in 2024, and the same percentage seen in 2023. \u201cThe cost of living continues to rise, prompting more individuals and households to turn to credit cards when in a bind,\u201d Bankrate Senior Economic Analyst Mark Hamrick says. \u201cThey are a terrific tool when used wisely and effectively. But with interest rates still high, we need to avoid a deepening debt burden which could make it more challenging to save.\u201d Additionally, 13 percent of people would reduce their spending on other things to afford an unexpected $1,000 emergency expense, 13 percent would borrow from family or friends, 5 percent would take out a personal loan and 4 percent would do something else. Learn more: How to start (and build) an emergency fund Payment methods for emergency expenses, by generation Generally, the older someone is, the more likely they are to use their savings in case of an emergency. Baby boomers are the likeliest generation (59 percent) to pay for an unexpected $1,000 emergency expense from their savings, followed by Gen Xers: Baby boomers (ages 61-79): 59 percent Gen Xers (ages 45-60): 42 percent Millennials (ages 29-44): 32 percent Gen Zers (ages 18-28) : 28 percent The economy is hurting Americans\u2019 savings Though inflation is no longer rising as quickly as it did in recent years, more people this year feel the economy has affected their savings . Nearly 3 in 4 Americans (73 percent) are saving less for emergency expenses due to inflation/rising prices, elevated interest rates or a change in income or employment. This percentage is up from 68 percent in 2024. Source: Bankrate Emergency Savings Surveys Note: Not all percentages total 100 due to rounding. More than 2 in 3 Americans worry they wouldn\u2019t be able to cover their living expenses if they lost their job With unemployment expected to hit 4.4 percent by the end of 2025, the majority of Americans feel unprepared. More than 2 in 3 people (69 percent) would be very or somewhat worried they wouldn\u2019t be able to cover their immediate living expenses over the next month if they were to lose a primary source of household income tomorrow (e.g., a job loss). That includes 46 percent who would be very worried \u2014 up from 42 percent in 2024. Source: Bankrate Emergency Savings Survey, Dec. 6-9, 2024 Note: Percentages don\u2019t total 100 due to rounding. By year: We asked: If you were to lose a primary source of household income tomorrow (for example, a job loss), how worried are you that you would not have enough emergency savings to cover your immediate living expenses over the next month? Year Very/somewhat worried Not too/not at all worried 2025 69% 31% 2024 66% 34% 2023 68% 32% Source: Bankrate Emergency Savings Surveys Only 31 percent of people say they are not too worried or not at all worried. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the future of the economy might bring, but an increasing share of people are anxious about potential job loss or interruption in income,\u201d Hamrick says. \u201cBy prioritizing saving, we can be better prepared for the unexpected and attain greater financial confidence and capability.\u201d Gen Zers are likelier than other generations to say they would be very or somewhat worried about having enough emergency savings to cover their immediate living expenses if they were to lose a primary source of income tomorrow: Gen Zers: 80 percent Millennials: 72 percent Gen Xers: 72 percent Baby boomers: 58 percent The results of this data are only a few months after many Americans said their emergency savings weren\u2019t where they wanted them to be. As of September 2024 polling in a separate Bankrate Emergency Savings Survey , 62 percent of people said they felt behind where they should be on saving for emergencies, including 37 percent who felt significantly behind and 26 percent who felt slightly behind. Only around a quarter (23 percent) of people said their emergency savings are on the right track. Also, at the time, 33 percent of people said they had less emergency savings than they did at the beginning of 2024. Additionally, 17 percent of people said they had no emergency savings at the beginning of 2024 and still had none in September. As of May 2024, over 1 in 4 people have no emergency savings Keeping at least three months of expenses saved can help you weather a job loss, major unexpected bill or other sudden expense . However, as of May 2024 polling, 27 percent of U.S. adults have no emergency savings at all, the highest percentage since Bankrate asked the question in 2020. Generationally, Americans vary widely in their emergency savings levels. Over 1 in 3 (34 percent) millennials have no emergency savings, the highest percentage of any generation: Gen Zers: 29 percent Millennials: 34 percent Gen Xers: 31 percent Baby boomers: 16 percent Source: Bankrate survey, May 17-20, 2024 Note: Percentages don\u2019t total 100 due to rounding. Almost 3 in 10 (29 percent) of people have some savings, but not enough to cover three months\u2019 expenses. That percentage hasn\u2019t changed much since 2022 and 2023, when 28 percent and 30 percent of people said the same, respectively. In 2024, that percentage is far higher for some generations, specifically Gen Zers. More than 2 in 5 (44 percent) Gen Zers have some savings, but less than would cover three months of expenses, the most of any generation. Lastly, only 28 percent of people have at least six months\u2019 expenses saved, down from 30 percent in 2023. Another 16 percent of people have between three and five months\u2019 expenses saved, the lowest percentage since 2018. How to start saving now If you\u2019re one of the 27 percent of Americans with no emergency savings, know it\u2019s not too late to start. Bankrate\u2019s savings guides can show you how to begin today, even if you\u2019ve never opened a savings account before. How to start saving Nearly half (46 percent) of baby boomers have at least six months of expenses saved. Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride points out that building an emergency savings cushion doesn\u2019t happen overnight, so the years baby boomers have had to save puts them ahead compared to other generations. But even if you haven\u2019t had decades to save, it\u2019s not too late to start saving more today. \u201cTo establish an emergency savings cushion, or add to what you have, set up a direct deposit from your paycheck or an automatic transfer from your checking account into a dedicated savings account,\u201d McBride says. \u201cAutomating the savings is the key to making it happen, particularly with household budgets so tight.\u201d Level of emergency savings, by income level Without the income to funnel into savings, lower-income households are more likely to have no emergency savings than higher-income households. Nearly half (46 percent) of households with an income under $50,000 per year have no emergency savings, compared to only 7 percent of those making $100,000 per year or more: We asked: How much do you have in emergency savings \u2013 that is, money that is readily available in either a checking account, savings account, or money market? Annual income of less than $50,000 Annual income of $50,000-$74,999 Annual income of $75,000-$99.999 Annual income of $100,000 or more No emergency savings 46% 19% 7% 7% Some, but less than would cover 3 months\u2019 expenses 32% 33% 31% 22% 3 to 5 months\u2019 expenses 11% 18% 24% 21% Enough to cover 6 months\u2019 expenses or more 11% 30% 38% 50% Over half of Americans are uncomfortable with their level of emergency savings Just under 6 in 10 (59 percent) U.S. adults are uncomfortable with their emergency savings, including 32 percent who are very uncomfortable and 27 percent who are somewhat uncomfortable. On the other hand, 41 percent are comfortable with their emergency savings, including 14 percent who are very comfortable and 28 percent who are somewhat comfortable. Two-thirds (66 percent) of Gen Xers are uncomfortable with their emergency savings, the highest percentage of any generation (compared to 63 percent of Gen Zers, 60 percent of millennials and 51 percent of baby boomers: Source: Bankrate survey, May 17-20, 2024 The high percentage of people uncomfortable with their emergency savings can be attributed, in part, to rising inflation. In 2021, 48 percent of people said they were uncomfortable with their level of emergency savings. The next year, as inflation rose, the percentage jumped to 58 percent. Inflation has remained stubbornly high, and the percentage of people uncomfortable with their savings has since plateaued: 2020: 44 percent 2021: 48 percent 2022: 58 percent 2023: 57 percent 2024: 59 percent Comfort with emergency savings, by income level Higher-income households tend to be more comfortable with their emergency savings than lower-income households. More than half (56 percent) of households with an income of $100,000 per year or higher say they\u2019re comfortable: $100,000 per year or more: 56 percent $75,000-$99,999: 48 percent $50,000-$74,999: 45 percent Less than $50,000 per year: 30 percent Majority needs at least 3 months of expenses saved to feel comfortable The majority (89 percent) of Americans say they would need at least three months of expenses saved in order to feel comfortable. Moreso, 63 percent would need to have at least six months of expenses saved to feel comfortable and 26 percent would need between three and five months of expenses saved. Most generations roughly agree they would need at least three months of expenses saved to feel comfortable. However, 72 percent of baby boomers and 70 percent of Gen Xers would need at least six months of expenses saved, higher percentages compared to younger generations: Source: Bankrate survey, May 17-20, 2024 Amount of savings versus comfort with savings People who have at least three months\u2019 worth of emergency savings tend to be most comfortable with their amount of savings. Nearly three-quarters (72 percent) of U.S. adults comfortable with their emergency savings have enough to cover at least three months of expenses. Specifically, 52 percent of people comfortable with their level of emergency savings have at least six months of expenses saved. On the other hand, 40 percent of people who are uncomfortable with their emergency savings have no emergency savings and 36 percent have something saved, but less than three months of expenses. As of January 2024, more than 1 in 3 Americans have more credit card debt than emergency savings More than 1 in 3 (36 percent) U.S. adults had more credit card debt than money saved in an emergency savings account in both 2023 and 2024. But, the majority (55 percent) of U.S. adults had more emergency savings than credit card debt in 2024. That\u2019s up from 51 percent in 2023 and is the highest percentage since 2018. Additionally, 10 percent of Americans had no credit card debt or emergency savings at all, the lowest percentage in the poll\u2019s 14-year history: Note: Not all percentages total 100 due to rounding. Source: Bankrate survey, January 19-21, 2024 Millennials and Gen Xers were more likely than other generations to have more credit card debt than emergency savings: Gen Zers: 32 percent Millennials: 46 percent Gen Xers: 47 percent Baby boomers: 24 percent Average credit card rates , as of December 2024, are at 20.27 percent. If you\u2019re carrying a credit card balance, you may end up paying a great deal of money in interest. \u201cFinancing purchases at 20 percent interest rates is a sign of the financial strain millions of households are feeling,\u201d McBride says. Percentage of people who have more credit card debt than emergency savings, by gender and income Women are more likely than men to have more credit card debt than emergency savings, or to have neither: We asked: Thinking about the amount of credit card debt you now have and the money you have in your emergency fund or savings account, which is higher? Gender Credit card debt Emergency savings No credit card debt and no emergency savings Women 40% 48% 12% Men 31% 62% 8% Additionally, the likelihood of having more emergency savings than credit card debt rises with income: We asked: Thinking about the amount of credit card debt you now have and the money you have in your emergency fund or savings account, which is higher? Year income Credit card debt Emergency savings No credit card debt and no emergency savings Less than $50,000 42% 40% 18% $50,000-$74,999 39% 57% 4% $75,000-$99,999 38% 59% 4% $100,000 or more 21% 78% 1% Americans want to improve both their debt and savings Regardless of their financial situation, more people in 2024 said they wanted to tackle both debt and savings , compared to 2023: 36 percent of U.S. adults said they\u2019re prioritizing both paying down debt and increasing emergency savings. It\u2019s the highest percentage in seven years, and up slightly from 2023, when 34 percent of people said the same. When picking between the two, more people said they were prioritizing emergency savings. Around 1 in 4 (28 percent) people were prioritizing boosting emergency savings, but that\u2019s the lowest percentage yet in Bankrate\u2019s polling. Another 25 percent were prioritizing paying down debt, up from 23 percent in 2023: Note: Not all percentages total 100 due to rounding. Source: Bankrate survey, Jan. 19-21, 2024 \u201cRecognizing that the cost of carrying debt has increased significantly in the past two years and the insufficient level of emergency savings, more Americans are focusing on both paying down debt and boosting emergency savings simultaneously, rather than one to the exclusion of the other.\u201d McBride says. \u201cHaving a direct deposit from your paycheck into a dedicated savings account automates the savings, allowing you to channel your take home pay toward the goal of paying down debt.\u201d All generations were more likely to prioritize both on paying down debt and increasing emergency savings, rather than only focusing on one. Notably, 43 percent of millennials are prioritizing paying both at the same time, while 22 percent are only paying down debt and 29 percent are only increasing emergency savings. In 2024, nearly 1 in 3 people had more emergency savings than they had in 2023 In 2024, almost a third (30 percent) of U.S. adults said they have more emergency savings now than they had a year ago, the highest percentage in Bankrate\u2019s polling since 2020.

Source: Bankrate survey, Jan. 19-21, 2024 3 tips on building your emergency fund amidst high inflation Building an emergency fund can be a lifeline if your income decreases or you lose your job. Here are three tips on how to start and maintain an emergency fund to prepare for uncertainty. 1. Figure out how much you need in emergency savings Experts commonly recommend saving three to six months of expenses in case of emergencies. For example, if your monthly bills total $2,000 a month, saving $6,000 will allow you to pay your bills for a short time if you lose your main source of income. This is not a concrete rule; you may need to save more if you are self-employed and anticipate a lean month, or if you are preparing for a major lifestyle change, like an upcoming move or a new baby. 2. Open a savings account just for emergencies Different emergency funds allow you to protect your savings and allow you quick access when you need the money. An online savings account, money market account, money market mutual fund or a separate savings account with your existing bank or credit union can allow you to save emergency funds for the future. \u201cAn action item for this new year should be to prioritize financial well-being,\u201d Hamrick says. \u201cAt the top of list, use direct deposit for a dedicated emergency fund. By choosing a high-yield insured savings account, your money will be working for you and accessible when needed.\u201d 3. Make a budget around savings You may already have a budget in place to make room for saving more, but make sure you stick to your good habits. Rebuilding your savings , or starting to save for the first time, can be easier by automatically transferring money to your savings each month or taking on side hustles for more income.

Its success sets a new standard for flexible spectrum transport and future high-capacity networking innovation. \"This new service demonstrates how ultra-high bandwidth backhaul, underpinned by flexible spectrum, can transform inter-capital connectivity for critical cloud applications and high-bandwidth tasks,\" said Nic Tippelt, CTO of Titan Telecoms. \"It\u2019s a step forward in enhancing Australia\u2019s digital infrastructure and delivering better services to Australian carriers. We\u2019re excited to be able to deliver 800Gbit/s circuits over infrastructure that traditionally had not supported such high bandwidth.\" The new service transports 800Gbit/s services over a 963km flexgrid ROADM network between data centers in Sydney and Melbourne, operating over Lumea\u2019s optical ground wire network. Using the Adtran FSP 3000 TeraFlex \u2122 CoreChannel \u2122 , the service applies adaptive symbol rate and spectral shaping capabilities, optimizing optical paths and reducing costs. The open technology interoperated with Ciena\u2019s OLS to enable highly adaptive ultra-high-capacity bandwidth. Managed by Adtran\u2019s Mosaic Network Controller with SDN control, the solution improves efficiency through dynamic resource allocation. \"Spectrum services will be key to meeting the escalating demand for high-speed internet and data services. The adaptive baud rate capability of our FSP 3000 TeraFlex \u2122 technology allows for dynamic adjustment, optimizing spectrum use and extending the reach of optical networks. Designed to inject more capacity into legacy infrastructure, TeraFlex \u2122 supports 800Gbit/s transport over long distances. It offers excellent client flexibility and efficiency, accommodating a mix of 400Gbit/s, 100Gbit/s and 10Gbit/s client services and multiplexing them to 800Gbit/s to minimize cost per Gbit per kilometer,\" commented Christoph Glingener, CTO of Adtran. \"What\u2019s more, our transmitter\u2019s superior signal-to-noise ratio and receiver\u2019s high noise tolerance help ensure compatibility with existing infrastructure, enabling long transmission distances and facilitating seamless upgrades without major overhauls.\" Story Continues About Adtran ADTRAN Holdings, Inc.

Biosciences Announces Preliminary Full Year 2024 Revenue Results Cytek Biosciences, Inc. Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 4:00 PM 7 min read In This Article: CTKB +4.66% Cytek Biosciences, Inc. FREMONT, Calif., Jan. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cytek Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: CTKB), a leading cell analysis solutions company, today announced preliminary, unaudited revenue results for the full year ended December 31, 2024. Cytek expects its full year revenue for 2024 to be between $200 million and $201 million, representing 4% growth over Cytek\u2019s 2023 revenue of $193.0 million. This included a negative foreign exchange impact of approximately $1.0 million. Expected fourth quarter revenue of $57 million to $58 million represents growth of 11% to 13% compared to the third quarter of 2024 and decline of 2% to flat compared to a strong fourth quarter of 2023. The appreciation of the US dollar negatively affected fourth quarter revenue by approximately $1.5 million. \u201cOur fourth quarter revenue was significantly higher than the prior quarters of 2024, consistent with our historical pattern, although it was slightly below expectations due to the impact of the appreciation of the US dollar against other currencies in which we do business, and order delays in some markets. Our revenue in Asia Pacific and Rest of World markets grew strongly,\u201d said Dr. Wenbin Jiang, CEO of Cytek Biosciences. \u201cDespite these headwinds, we remain confident in Cytek\u2019s long-term potential and business strategy. There is a large and growing opportunity for our advanced cell analysis tools, and with strong execution across our portfolio, we are well positioned to deliver sustainable growth and profitability.\u201d The preliminary financial results in this press release are not a comprehensive statement of Cytek\u2019s financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2024, and have not been audited, reviewed or compiled by its independent registered public accounting firm. Cytek\u2019s actual revenue may differ from the estimate due to the completion of the Company\u2019s year-end closing and auditing procedures and is therefore subject to adjustment. Cytek plans to report financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2024, and to provide 2025 financial guidance during its earnings call expected to be held near the end of February 2025. J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference Cytek will present and participate in a Q&A session at the 43 rd Annual\u00a0J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, CA on January 16, 2025, at 8:15 a.m. Pacific time. Interested parties may access a live and archived webcast of the presentation on the \u201cInvestors\u201d section of the company website at: investors.cytekbio.com.

NASA-DOE Contract to Continue Development of Space Microreactor Concept Business Wire Tue, Jan 7, 2025, 5:00 PM 3 min read NASA and DOE Continue Collaboration with Westinghouse on Fission Surface Power Project CRANBERRY TOWNSHIP, Pa., January 07, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Westinghouse Electric Company announced today that NASA, working with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), has selected Westinghouse to continue development of a space microreactor design through the Fission Surface Power (FSP) project. The FSP project is focused on developing concept designs for small, electricity-generating nuclear fission reactors that could provide astronauts a reliable power supply for use on the moon and beyond. This contract, awarded by Idaho National Laboratory (INL), will build on the successful design work Westinghouse completed during Phase 1 to optimize its contributions to the design of FSP systems and their configuration, and begin testing of critical technology elements. The continued progress under the FSP project can enable NASA\u2019s goal of a lunar demonstration within the next decade. \"Westinghouse appreciates the opportunity to continue demonstrating its leadership in designing microreactors for space and lunar exploration missions,\" said Richard Rademacher, President, Westinghouse Government Services. \"This award reflects our close collaboration with NASA and the progress we\u2019ve made on the FSP program that will enable a strategic capability for the Artemis mission . We look forward to testing and demonstrating our proprietary microreactor technology in the coming years under this important NASA initiative.\" NASA\u2019s FSP program expands on the efforts of the agency\u2019s Kilopower project to develop affordable fission nuclear power technologies for long-duration stays on planetary surfaces. Currently, NASA is working with DOE to design a fission power system that would provide up to 40 kilowatts of power \u2013 enough to continuously run 30 households for 10 years. A future lunar demonstration will pave the way for sustainable operations and base camps on the Moon and Mars. Westinghouse is leveraging its eVinci TM microreactor technology to develop a resilient and mass efficient nuclear electric power and propulsion system for satellite, spacecraft and planetary surface power applications. Building on decades of industry-leading Westinghouse innovation to bring carbon-free, safe and scalable energy wherever it is needed for a variety of applications, the eVinci microreactor generates reliable electricity and heating for remote communities, universities, mining operations, industrial centers, data centers, defense facilities, and soon the lunar surface and beyond. These resilient microreactors have very few moving parts, providing versatility for mission types with the reduction of failure points, simple operation and increased reliability for the harsh environment of space. Leer m\u00e1s Westinghouse Electric Company is shaping the future of carbon-free energy by providing safe, innovative nuclear and other clean power technologies and services globally. Westinghouse supplied the world\u2019s first commercial pressurized water reactor in 1957 and the company\u2019s technology is the basis for nearly one-half of the world's operating nuclear plants. Over 135 years of innovation makes Westinghouse the preferred partner for advanced technologies covering the complete nuclear energy life cycle.

Americans have a love-hate relationship with their credit cards. Though many people try their best to pay their cards off in full, a large percentage of American credit cardholders are carrying a balance from month \u2014 and it\u2019s proving costly. After over a year of record-high interest rates, the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate three times in the second half of 2024. But credit card borrowers are still paying a record-high average annual percentage rate (APR) of over 20 percent, according to Bankrate . In other words, today\u2019s Americans taking on credit card debt pay much more in interest than they would have on that same debt only a few years ago. On top of that, stubborn inflation has contributed to many Americans going into debt to finance their normal levels of spending. To keep up with the country\u2019s changing credit card habits, Bankrate conducted several surveys with polling agencies YouGov Plc and SSRS in the last year. In each poll, Bankrate surveyed between 1,000 to 2,000+ Americans over the age of 18 on topics like credit card usage, how long they\u2019ve maintained a balance and if they\u2019re prioritizing paying down that balance. The resulting data, weighted to represent all U.S. adults, shines a light on Americans\u2019 struggles with credit card debt. As of November 2024 polling, almost half (48 percent) of credit cardholders carry debt from month to month, according to Bankrate\u2019s latest Credit Card Debt Survey . Read on for a snapshot of Americans\u2019 attitudes and habits on credit card debt. Bankrate will update this with new data throughout the year. Key takeaways Credit card balances have recovered slightly 48% of credit cardholders carry debt from month to month. That\u2019s down slightly from 50% in June 2024.

Story Continues Nearly half of credit cardholders (48 percent) carry debt from month to month, according to our Credit Card Debt Survey. That\u2019s down from 50 percent in June 2024, but up from 39 percent in 2021: Source: Bankrate\u2019s Credit Card Debt Surveys Note: Among respondents who are credit cardholders Personal finance experts recommend paying your credit card in full every month to avoid high interest rates on your purchases. But in practice, more than half (53 percent) of U.S. adults who carry a balance on their credit cards have had the balance for at least a year. While that\u2019s down from 60 percent in June 2024, it\u2019s up from 50 percent in late 2021. Unfortunately, many people carrying credit card debt have that debt due to an emergency. Nearly half (47 percent) of people who carry a balance on their credit cards say the primary cause was an emergency or unexpected expense, which includes medical bills (15 percent), car repairs (9 percent), home repairs (7 percent) and other emergency or unexpected expenses (16 percent). Others cited routine expenses: Day-to-day expenses, such as groceries, childcare and utilities: 28 percent Retail purchases, such as clothing and electronics: 11 percent Vacation/entertainment expenses: 9 percent Pay off your credit card debt Starting to pay off credit card debt aggressively isn\u2019t easy. These payoff strategies give you a place to start. How to pay off credit card debt The majority (71 percent) of credit cardholders who carry balance(s) from month to month expect to pay off their credit card debt within five years, including 30 percent who expect to pay it off within a year and 41 percent who expect to pay it off between one and five years from now. On the other hand, 13 percent expect it will take more than a decade to pay off their debt, including 6 percent who expect to never get out of credit card debt. \u201cIf you have credit card debt, take matters into your own hands to pay it down as quickly as possible,\u201d Bankrate Senior Industry Analyst Ted Rossman says. \u201cIf you can\u2019t pay it off right away, sign up for a balance transfer card with a generous 0 percent interest term. Some of these deals last as long as 21 months.\u201d Credit card debt, by generation Gen X credit cardholders are the likeliest generation to carry credit card balance(s) from month to month: Gen Z credit cardholders (ages 18-28): 47 percent Millennial credit cardholders (ages 29-44): 48 percent Gen X credit cardholders (ages 45-60): 54 percent Baby boomer cardholders (ages 61-79): 45 percent A record-high percentage of Americans have more credit card debt than savings Key insights from Bankrate's Emergency Savings Report 36% of U.S. adults have more credit card debt than emergency savings. 36% of U.S. adults are prioritizing both debt repayment and building emergency savings, as opposed to just focusing on one. Having an emergency fund with at least three months of expenses saved is a vital resource in case of a job loss or unexpected bill, but 36 percent of U.S. adults have more credit card debt than emergency savings, according to our Emergency Savings Report. That\u2019s a record-high percentage \u2014 the highest (tied with 2023) since Bankrate began asking the question in 2011. Additionally, 54 percent of U.S. adults have more in their emergency fund or savings, and 10 percent have no credit card debt and no savings.

When asked to choose whether paying down debt or building emergency savings is a higher priority for them, 25 percent of people say they\u2019re prioritizing paying down debt, up slightly from 23 percent in 2023. In 2024, 36 percent said they were focused on both paying down debt and increasing emergency savings at the same time: Focused on both at the same time: 36 percent Increasing emergency savings: 28 percent Paying down debt: 25 percent Neither one is a priority: 11 percent Credit card debt vs. emergency savings, by generation When asked to compare their emergency savings and credit card debt, baby boomers are the most likely generation to have more in an emergency fund or savings.

In comparison, 39 percent of people cite their own health and 38 percent cite current events (such as world news, politics, climate change, etc.). Specifically, 47 percent of U.S. adults who say money causes a negative impact on their mental health cite being in debt \u2014 like credit card debt, medical debt or student loan debt \u2014 as a reason why. People also cited other factors that may have contributed to carrying debt, such as inflation and rising prices (65 percent) and rising interest rates (28 percent): Source: Bankrate\u2019s Money and Mental Health Survey, March 18-20, 2024 Notes: Participants could select more than one answer; Percentages are of U.S. adults who have money concerns that impact their mental health \u201cWhen we worry about things, a lot of the time it\u2019s because we feel out of control. Take some of that power back by putting a plan together,\u201d Rossman says. People who cite debt as negatively impacting their mental health, by generation Perhaps because they\u2019ve had less time to accumulate debt than older generations, Gen Zers whose mental health is negatively affected by money, at least occasionally, are the least likely generation to cite being in debt (30 percent) as a reason why: Gen Zers: 30 percent Millennials: 53 percent Gen Xers: 50 percent Baby boomers: 48 percent Many Americans would take on more debt to travel or dine out Key insights from Bankrate's Discretionary Spending Survey 38% of U.S. adults were willing to go into debt for discretionary purchases in 2024. 27% of U.S. adults would go into debt to travel, more than live entertainment or dining out. Despite the rising percentage of people already in credit card debt , Americans say they\u2019re willing to go into debt for the sake of experiences. Nearly 2 in 5 (38 percent) U.S. adults were willing to go into debt to travel, dine out or see live entertainment in 2024, according to our Discretionary Spending Survey. The highest percentage of people would be willing to take on debt to travel, at 27 percent, followed by dining out (14 percent) and live entertainment (13 percent): Source: Bankrate\u2019s Discretionary Spending Survey, March 4-6, 2024 Note: Respondents could select more than one option. The demand for entertainment away from home comes even as inflation and high interest rates weaken consumers\u2019 buying power today, according to Rossman. \u201cSome of that reflects a \u2018you only live once\u2019 mentality that intensified during the pandemic, and some of that is because many economic indicators \u2014 including GDP growth and the unemployment rate \u2014 are in favorable shape,\u201d Rossman says. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of inequality in the economy, and that\u2019s very evident in these results.\u201d Willingness to go into debt for discretionary purchases, by generation Millennials and Gen Zers are far more likely than older generations to go into debt for these discretionary purchases. Notably, 35 percent of millennials would go into debt this year to travel: Purchase Gen Zers\u00a0 (ages 18-27) Millennials (ages 28-43) Gen Xers (ages 44-59) Baby boomers (ages 60-78) Travel 30% 35% 23% 22% Live entertainment (e.g. concerts, sporting events, theater performances, etc.) 22% 23% 7% 4% Dining out 22% 23% 9% 8% None of these 47% 49% 70% 74% Many people are focusing on credit card rewards even as they carry a balance Key insights from Bankrate's Chasing Rewards in Debt Survey 67% of Americans with credit card debt make an effort to maximize credit card rewards. 75% of Americans who typically pay their credit cards in full make an effort to maximize credit card rewards. Despite the high percentage of people who carry a balance on their credit cards, the majority of people are chasing credit card rewards . One-third (33 percent) of credit cardholders say they make every effort to maximize credit card rewards and 39 percent say they make some effort, according to our Chasing Rewards in Debt Survey. Despite not having their cards paid off, 67 percent of people who carry a balance on their credit cards make an effort to maximize credit card rewards, at 27 percent making \u201cevery effort\u201d and 40 percent making \u201csome effort.\u201d Over 1 in 3 (33 percent) credit cardholders who carry a balance make no effort to maximize credit card rewards. Source: Bankrate\u2019s Chasing Rewards in Debt Survey, Jan. 24-26, 2024 Note: Not all percentages total 100 due to rounding. Flashy rewards are a big incentive to use credit cards, but Rossman believes people who take on debt to collect rewards aren\u2019t using their cards wisely. Chasing rewards while you\u2019re in debt is a big mistake. It doesn\u2019t make sense to pay 20 percent or more in interest just to earn 1, 2 or even 5 percent in cash back or airline miles. \u2014 Ted Rossman, Bankrate Senior Credit Card Analyst A beginner\u2019s guide to credit card points Learn how credit card points work. Pros and cons of rewards credit cards Is a rewards credit card worth it? Credit cardholders who maximize rewards, by generation Gen Z credit cardholders are the most likely generation to put in some effort to maximize credit card rewards. Gen X and baby boomer credit cardholders are tied as the generations most likely to make no effort to maximize credit card rewards at all. Gen Z cardholders\u00a0 (ages 18-27) Millennial cardholders (ages 28-43) Gen X cardholders (ages 44-59) Baby boomer cardholders\u00a0 (ages 60-78) I make every effort to maximize credit card rewards 35% 36% 31% 30% I make some effort to maximize credit card rewards 42% 38% 39% 39% I make no effort to maximize credit card rewards 23% 26% 31% 31% The bottom line If you\u2019re one of the millions of Americans carrying credit card debt from month to month, you may already know that paying it down can be an exhausting, uphill battle. While credit card debt is nothing to be ashamed of, it\u2019s vital you make a plan to pay it off. Otherwise, high interest could cause your debt to spiral out of control. Set aside a portion of your discretionary budget to pay more than the minimum on your credit card every month. If your budget is tight, you may need to get creative. Funnel any extra funds, like from a side hustle, work bonus or tax refund , towards credit card debt, and see where you can cut back in other categories in your budget. Any amount you can spare over your minimum will put you one step closer to paying off that debt for good. Learn how to pay off your credit card debt Not sure how to pay down your debt? This credit card debt payoff calculator can help you make a plan based on your budget and timeline. You have different methods at your disposal to tackle your debt depending on what works best for you. If you have debt with very high interest rates (such as credit card debt), consider the debt snowball payoff method, where you pay your highest-interest debts first to avoid paying more in the long run. Or, if you need a motivational boost, you can pay your smallest debts first and work your way up to your largest debts, a method called the debt snowball. Another strategy is a 0 percent balance transfer card , which allows you to move your balance to a new card with 0 percent interest for a limited time, often 12 to 21 months. You can use that time to aggressively pay down your principal without worrying about racking up additional interest. No matter what strategy you choose, paying off debt is something to celebrate. Congratulate yourself on the win and know you\u2019re one step closer to financial freedom. Methodology Bankrate commissioned YouGov Plc to conduct the survey on credit card balances .

Holdco indirectly owns 100% of the share capital and voting rights of Brookfield Renewable Holdings (subject to the reinvestment of the Managers as described in Section 1.3.2). (iii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Governance of Holdco Holdco is a private limited company incorporated under the laws of England. The board of directors of Holdco (\" Holdco Board \") oversees the management of Holdco and its subsidiaries and has full and complete authority, power and discretion to manage and control the business affairs and properties of Holdco.

Since then, Neoen has established itself as a renowned independent player in the global renewable energy sector with 10.36 GW of secured capacity and 20.3 GW of advanced pipeline. Neoen has a presence in 15 countries, including strong positions in France and Australia. On 17 October 2018, Neoen's shares were admitted to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris. After having successfully grown its development business and portfolio of renewables projects over the preceding 10 years, Neoen\u2019s listing allowed the Group to pursue its successful growth and supported the capital-intensive nature of a scaling renewables development business. At the end of 2023, Neoen was present in 15 countries and had approximately 8 GW of assets in operation or under construction across solar, wind and storage technologies. Brookfield closely followed the development of Neoen. After a period of negotiation and due diligence, the Offeror made an offer to the main Company's shareholders (including Impala24F 25 ), following which the envisaged majority stake acquisition by Brookfield was announced on 30 May 2024 as further indicated below. The Offeror regards Neoen as a high-quality global developer and operator, and believes that the Group would represent a complementary addition to Brookfield's existing renewable power and transition portfolio. The Offeror believes it is uniquely positioned to assist the Company in the next stage of its growth, from a commercial and financial perspective. Neoen\u2019s growth is based on a strategy of geographic and technological diversification of its project portfolio, allowing it to create leading development capabilities across multiple core clean energy technologies. This has led to the Company strategically building global leadership positions in key markets while maintaining a balanced portfolio of contracted energy assets with complementary revenue profile characteristics. As France\u2019s leading independent producer of exclusively renewable electricity, and Australia\u2019s overall leading renewable electricity producer, Neoen develops its own projects in-house, and arranges their contracting and financing as part of the project management process. After site commissioning, the Company operates, monitors and manages projects through their useful life. Impala, controlled and managed by Mr. Jacques Veyrat, has been a cornerstone founder and investor of Neoen since 2008, supporting the Company\u2019s growth over the same period. Since 2018, Neoen has grown from 2 GW to 8 GW of assets in operation or under construction, reaching a very significant scale of operations and development. Today, the Company has the opportunity to more than double this capacity by the end of the decade, potentially reaching between 15-20 GW of assets in operation or under construction over the same time period. To execute on this opportunity set, the Company would need to deploy substantial capital at pace. In this context, the Offeror has appeared to the Selling Shareholders (as such term is defined below) as a suitable majority shareholder, already among the world leaders in renewable energy, with the global operating capability and access to scale capital necessary to provide support for this next phase of growth of the Group. The Offeror has stated its support for the Company\u2019s management team and ambition to continue deploying renewables projects at scale, and looks forward to partnering in growing the business to meet the increasing demand for clean power globally. On 30 May 2024 (the \" Announcement Date \"), the Offeror entered into a put option agreement with Impala, the Fonds Strat\u00e9gique de Participation (\" FSP \")25F 26 , Cartusia and Mr. Xavier Barbaro (and his family members), C\u00e9leste Management SA26F 27 (\" C\u00e9leste \") and Mosca Animation Participations et Conseil27F 28 (\" Mosca \", together with Impala, the FSP, Cartusia and Mr. Xavier Barbaro (and his family members) and C\u00e9leste, the \" Selling Shareholders \") to acquire approximately a 53.32% shareholding in the Company at the Offer Price per Share. On 24 June 2024, following completion of the works council information and consultation process, and exercise of the put option by the Selling Shareholders, the Offeror, as purchaser, entered into a share purchase agreement (as amended on 19 December 2024) (the \" SPA \") with the Selling Shareholders, to acquire approximately 53.12%28F 29 of the Company at the Offer Price per Share (the \" Block Trade Acquisition \"). On the same day, the Offeror entered into an undertaking to tender with the FPCI FONDS ETI 202029F 30 (the \" BPI Tender Undertaking \") pursuant to which Bpifrance, acting on behalf of FPCI FONDS ETI 2020, undertakes to tender its 6,674,470 Shares (representing at such date 4.36% of the share capital and theoretical voting rights of the Company) into the Offer. On 27 December 2024, following satisfaction of the condition precedents provided for under the SPA (i.e., see relevant regulatory approvals referred to in Section 1.1.6), and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the SPA, the Offeror completed the Block Trade Acquisition and acquired 81,197,100 Shares from the Selling Shareholders representing 81,197,100 theoretical voting rights (i.e. 53.12% of the share capital and theoretical voting rights of the Company)30F 31 .

The antitrust clearance from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission was obtained on 31 October 2024 subject to the divestments detailed in Section 1.2.6. 1.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Intentions of the Offeror for the next twelve months 1.1.7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Industrial, commercial and financial strategy Brookfield Renewable Holdings' intention is to operate Neoen as a standalone portfolio company led by the existing management team, with its own balance sheet and budget, while benefiting from the full support of Brookfield's global renewable power and transition platform and asset management capabilities. Brookfield Renewable Holdings is supportive of the Company\u2019s existing strategy with respect to countries and technologies, as well as general approach to contracting. As part of this strategy, Brookfield Renewable Holdings intends to continue the ongoing disposal of assets in non-core jurisdictions in Africa and Latin America, including in Jamaica and Zambia, in order to allocate more resources and focus on core assets and regions where Brookfield Renewable Holdings sees the most potential for value creation. Any expansion beyond the current footprint would be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Today, Neoen pursues farm-downs with a communicated limit of no more than 20% of the annual capacity increase in the secured portfolio, and no more than 20% contribution of annual reported EBITDA as per the Company\u2019s annual financial report. Farm-downs are primarily executed once development projects are taken through construction and have reached commercial operations. Brookfield Renewable Holdings intends to maintain the Company\u2019s existing farm-down strategy, but would retain the flexibility to exceed any such previously communicated limit, and to pursue farm-downs of larger portfolios and Company assets on a regional basis. The amount of farm-downs will be assessed based on the future capital requirements of the Company to fund growth, amongst other considerations. Brookfield Renewable Holdings also intends to support the Company\u2019s debt capital markets strategy, and gradually expand the corporate financing facilities over time as the business grows. 1.1.8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Intentions regarding employment The Offer is part of an ongoing growth strategy with respect to Neoen and should not have any particular impact on the Group's workforce and human resources management policies, nor on the working conditions of employees or their collective or individual status. In particular, Brookfield Renewable Holdings intends to rely, preserve and develop the talent and know-how of the Group's workforce in order to continue the development and growth of the Group. Brookfield Renewable Holdings intends to maintain and keep the Company's workforce to implement this strategy and is not considering any substantial changes in the way and the locations where the Group operates. 1.1.9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Composition of the Company's governing bodies and management The board of directors of the Company currently comprises seven (7) directors, three (3) of which represent Brookfield Renewable Holdings and have been co-opted as directors on the date of completion of the Block Trade Acquisition in replacement of the resigning directors representing the Selling Shareholders. Under the BPI Tender Undertaking, Bpifrance has undertaken to cause its representative at the board of directors to resign from her position upon having tendered its Shares into the Offer and Brookfield Renewable Holdings intends to request the co-optation of an additional representative at the board of directors of the Company at this time. Subject to the success of the Offer, the Offeror may further modify the composition of the board of directors of the Company to reflect its new shareholding structure. Should the Offer be followed by a Squeeze-Out, it will result in the delisting of the Shares and/or the OCEANEs from Euronext Paris and/or Euronext Access. If so, further changes in the composition of the Company's corporate bodies may be envisaged. Brookfield Renewable Holdings intends to rely on the current management team in place and fully supports the Company's strategy and current operations. Should the Squeeze-Out be implemented and the Company be delisted, it is envisaged that the current CEO and Deputy CEO of the Company resign from their current corporate offices within the Company and have, directly or indirectly, executive positions within the Offeror's acquisition structure (including within the Offeror). 1.1.10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Interest of the Offer for the Offeror, the Company and its shareholders As indicated in Section 1.1.2, the Offeror regards Neoen as a high-quality global developer and operator of renewable assets, and believes that the Group would represent a complementary addition to Brookfield's existing renewable power and transition portfolio. The Offeror believes it is uniquely positioned to assist the Company in the next stage of its growth, from a commercial and financial perspective. The Offer will allow the minority shareholders of the Company and holders of OCEANEs to achieve immediate and full liquidity of their Shares and OCEANEs: the Offer Price per Share represents a 26.9% premium over the last closing price of the Shares on the Announcement Date and premia of 40.3% and 43.5% over the 3-month and 6-month volume-weighted average price (\" VWAP \") respectively, as well as significant premia on the other valuation criteria; and the Offer Price per 2020 OCEANE and the Offer Price per 2022 OCEANE are aligned with the prices resulting from the adjustment provisions of the OCEANEs in case of Change of Control (as such term is defined in the terms and conditions of the OCEANEs). The summary assessment of the Offer Price per Share, the Offer Price per 2020 OCEANE and the Offer Price per 2022 OCEANE is provided in Section 3 of this Press Release. An independent expert has reviewed the fairness of the financial terms of the Offer. This fairness opinion will be reproduced in its entirety in the draft response document that will be published by Neoen together with the reasoned opinion of the Company's board of directors. 1.1.11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Synergies \u2013 Economic gains The Offeror is a company incorporated in France, whose corporate purpose is to acquire, manage and hold stakes in the share capital and voting rights of French and foreign companies. The Offeror, which does not have any stake in other companies, does not anticipate the realization of cost or revenue synergies with the Company following the completion of the Offer. 1.1.12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Intentions regarding a potential merger or legal reorganization The Offeror does not intend to merge with the Company. For the purpose of obtaining the antitrust clearance from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission as part of the Block Trade Acquisition (described in Section 1.1.6=, the Offeror has agreed to divest the entire portfolio of assets and projects in the State of Victoria, Australia, which includes 652 MW33F 34 of assets in operation and approximately 2.8 GW of projects in development (the \" Victorian Assets \"). The Company has entered into an agreement with HMC, an alternative asset manager listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, for the sale of its Victorian Assets (the \" HMC Transaction \"), with an intended completion date as at 1 July 2025. Subject to the implementation of the Squeeze-Out and the delisting, the Australian business assets (including the Victorian Assets to the extent closing of the HMC Transaction would not have already occurred) would undergo an internal reorganisation within the group controlled by Holdco driven by commercial and strategic preferences to move towards transferring assets into separately managed hubs. Additional post-closing of the Offer corporate restructuring steps of a purely capitalistic nature may be decided and implemented in order in particular to facilitate the optimization of Neoen's debt facilities. In that context, should the Squeeze-Out and the delisting of the Company be implemented, a change in the current corporate form of the Company may be envisaged. All such corporate reorganizations would not have any impact on Neoen's operations or workforce. Relevant staff representative bodies would be informed and/or consulted, as and when required, in accordance with applicable laws. However, the Offeror reserves the right to proceed with any subsequent changes in the organization of the Group, the Company, or of other entities of the Group, especially that are necessary to implement the strategy described in Section 1.2.1. The Offeror further intends to propose to the 2025 annual shareholders\u2019 meeting of the Company to be held before 30 June 2025, to approve the deletion of the double voting rights attached to shares registered in \"pure\" registered form for more than two years (previously approved in 2023 and provided for in Article 11 of the Company\u2019s by-laws). 1.1.13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Intentions regarding the implementation of a squeeze-out and a delisting of the Company following the Offer In the event that the number of Shares not tendered to the Offer by the minority shareholders of the Company (excluding treasury Shares held by the Company and Shares covered (or that will be covered) by Liquidity Agreements but including the PEE Unavailable Shares and the 2023 Accelerated Free Shares) does not represent more than 10% of the share capital and voting rights of the Company following the Offer, Brookfield Renewable Holdings intends to implement, at the latest within three (3) months following the closing of the Offer, in accordance with Articles L. 433- 4 II of the French Monetary and Financial Code and 237-1 et seq. of the AMF General Regulation, a Squeeze-Out procedure in order to transfer the Shares not tendered to the Offer (excluding treasury Shares held by the Company and Shares covered (or that will be covered) by Liquidity Agreements, but including the PEE Unavailable Shares and the 2023 Accelerated Free Shares) in exchange for compensation equal to the Offer Price per Share. The implementation of this procedure will result in the delisting of the Shares from Euronext Paris. In addition, in the event that the number of Shares not tendered to the Offer by the minority shareholders of the Company (excluding treasury Shares held by the Company and Shares covered (or that will be covered) by Liquidity Agreements but including the PEE Unavailable Shares and the 2023 Accelerated Free Shares) and the number of Shares that may be issued following the conversion of the OCEANEs not tendered in the Offer do not represent more than 10% of the sum of the existing Shares and the Shares that may be issued as a result of the conversion of the OCEANEs following the Offer34F 35 , Brookfield Renewable Holdings also intends to implement, at the latest within three (3) months following the closing of the Offer, in accordance with Articles L. 433-4 III of the French Monetary and Financial Code and 237-1 et seq of the AMF General Regulation, a Squeeze-Out procedure in order to transfer the OCEANEs not tendered to the Offer in exchange for compensation equal to the Offer Price per 2020 OCEANE and the Offer Price per 2022 OCEANE. The implementation of this procedure will result in the delisting of the OCEANEs from Euronext Access. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the OCEANEs, the Company may, at its discretion and at any time, but subject to giving at least 30 calendar days' notice (and a maximum of 90 calendar days), redeem at par plus accrued interest all of the relevant remaining outstanding OCEANEs, if they represent less than 15% of the number of the 2020 OCEANEs issued with respect to the 2020 OCEANEs and if they represent less than 20% of the number of the 2022 OCEANEs issued with respect to the 2022 OCEANEs (the \" Early Redemption Option \"). In the event that the conditions required to implement a Squeeze-Out for the Shares are met, but the conditions required to implement a squeeze-out for the OCEANEs are not met, Brookfield Renewable Holdings intends to implement a Squeeze-Out for the Shares under the conditions set out above, subject to the Company being able to exercise the Early Redemption Option in due course (it being specified that Brookfield Renewable Holdings reserves the right to waive this condition). Holders of OCEANEs will, however, retain the right to exercise their right to the allocation of Shares up to and including the 7 th business day35F 36 preceding the date set for early redemption. The conversion/exchange ratios shall be equal to the relevant conversion/exchange ratio if the allocation right is exercised during the Adjustment Period (as defined below), or equal to the relevant conversion/exchange ratios in force outside of the Adjustment Period (as defined below) and indicated in Section 2.6. In the event that the Offeror is not in a position, following the Offer, to implement a squeeze-out under the above-mentioned conditions, it reserves the right to file a public tender offer followed, if applicable, by a squeeze-out for the Shares and/or OCEANEs it does not hold directly or indirectly, alone or in concert at that date. In this context, the Offeror does not exclude increasing its interest in the Company after the end of the Offer (directly or indirectly, through the acquisition of Shares or OCEANEs or otherwise) and prior to the filing of a new offer in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory provisions. In this case, the public tender offer will be subject to the control of the AMF, which will rule on its conformity in light of the independent expert's report to be appointed in accordance with the provisions of Article 261-1 I and II of the AMF General Regulation. The Offeror reserves the right, following the acquisition of OCEANEs, to exercise any right available to it in accordance with the terms and conditions of the OCEANEs. The Offeror also reserves the right to cause the Company to exercise any right available to it in accordance with the terms and conditions of the OCEANEs. 1.1.14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Company's dividend distribution policy Following the Offer, the Company's dividend policy will continue to be determined by its corporate bodies based on Company's distributive capacity, financial situation and financial needs, in compliance with any applicable regulatory requirements. 1.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Agreements that may have a significant impact on the assessment or outcome of the Offer 1.2.15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BPI's undertaking to tender its Shares in the Offer As indicated in Section 1.1.2, on 24 June 2024, Brookfield Renewable Holdings entered into the BPI Tender Undertaking with Bpifrance pursuant to which Bpifrance undertakes to tender its 6,674,470 Shares (representing at such date 4.36% of the share capital and theoretical voting rights of the Company) into the Offer (the \" BPI Shares \"). The BPI Shares which are the subject of this BPI Tender Undertaking will be tendered to the Offer at the Offer Price per Share. Bpifrance has notably undertaken to keep the free and full property of the BPI Shares until the date upon which it will tender the BPI Shares to the Offer, not to encumber them with any right or any engagement whatsoever and not to transfer title to the BPI Shares, enter into any agreement with, or give any undertaking to, a third party to transfer or restrict the ownership of, or rights in, the BPI Shares, nor grant any rights whatsoever over the BPI Shares in favour of a third party. Under the BPI Tender Undertaking, Bpifrance has agreed to cause its representative at the board of directors of the Company to resign from her position upon having tendered its Shares into the Offer (see also Section 1.2.3). The undertaking of Bpifrance is notably subject to the Offer being cleared by the AMF. This undertaking may be terminated by Bpifrance in the event, cumulatively, (i) of a competing offer filed by a third party which would be cleared by the AMF and (ii) (A) in the absence of an improved offer by the Offeror that is declared compliant ( conforme ) by the AMF or (B) in case of withdrawal of the Offer by the Offeror in accordance with article 232-11 of the AMF General Regulations. The Offeror and Bpifrance are not acting in concert. 1.2.16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reinvestment of the managers (e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description of the Reinvestment Plan and the Synthetic Share Plan Brookfield Renewable Holdings and Cartusia have entered into a reinvestment agreement on 27 December 2024, (the \" Reinvestment Agreement \"), in order to set out the main provision of (i) the reinvestment plan that should be put in place at the level of BRHL UK MidCo Limited36F 37 (\" BRHL Midco \"), an intermediary holding vehicle wholly owned by Holdco, which in turn indirectly wholly-owns Brookfield Renewable Holdings, for the benefit of certain executives and corporate officers of the Group, including Mr. Xavier Barbaro (acting as legal representative of Cartusia) and Mr. Romain Desrousseaux (the \" Managers \") (the \" Reinvestment Plan \") and (ii) the synthetic share plan that should be put in place for the benefit of the Managers (the \" Synthetic Share Plan \"), in each case, following the closing of the Offer. In the context of the Reinvestment Plan, the Managers will enter into or adhere to a shareholders' agreement in respect of BRHL Midco, which will reflect the terms of the Reinvestment Agreement (the \" BRHL Midco SHA \"). The Reinvestment Plan includes: an investment by certain Managers in ordinary shares of the BRHL Midco, pari passu with BRHL UK Topco Limited37F 38 (\" BRHL Topco \"), being an intermediate vehicle wholly-owned by Holdco and shareholder of BRHL Midco, financed by the use of all or part of their Shares proceeds received as part of the Block Trade Acquisition, the Offer or resulting from the contribution in kind of their Shares at the Offer Price per Share to BRHL Midco; and the free grant to certain Managers of ordinary shares of BRHL Midco, as part of a new retention plan in cash (see Section 2.4). The ordinary shares issued by BRHL Midco will be subscribed for at market value, as the case may be, determined by an expert. The Synthetic Share Plan would consist of bonus payments to the Managers, for an amount corresponding to the notional value attached to synthetic shares (the \" Synthetic Shares \") awarded to them, as follows: the Synthetic Share Plan provides for a linear vesting of the Synthetic Shares over a period of five years (with customary accelerated vesting provisions); the notional value of the Synthetic Shares is based on the capital gain realized by BRHL Topco on its investment in BRHL Midco above a certain hurdle rate, upon the occurrence of (i)\u00a0a termination of duties of a Manager, (ii)\u00a0a listing of a company of the Group, (iii)\u00a0a direct or indirect transfer of shares in BRHL Midco, (iv)\u00a0a winding-up of BRHL Midco or (v) a significant dividend distribution by BRHL Midco (an \" Exit \"). (f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reinvestment of CEO and Deputy CEO Cartusia (in accordance with the terms of the Reinvestment Agreement) has committed to reinvest in cash at the level of BRHL Midco, by way of subscription to ordinary shares of BRHL Midco, for an aggregate reinvestment amount of EUR 25 million. In accordance with the reinvestment agreement entered into on 27 December 2024 between Brookfield Renewable Holdings and Mr. Romain Desrousseaux, the latter has the option to reinvest a maximum total amount of approximately EUR 6.2 million, which may be carried out directly or indirectly, by way of a contribution in kind of all or part of the RD Shares That May Be Tendered at the Offer Price per Share or by way of a cash contribution. (g)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description of BRHL Midco SHA \u2013 Transfers of securities and liquidity The following provisions shall be applicable to transfers of BRHL Midco securities: Pre-emption right of BRHL Topco: BRHL Topco shall benefit from a pre-emption right in the event of a transfer by a Manager of his/her securities in BRHL Midco other than a customary free transfer, unless such transfer has been approved by BRHL Topco. Drag along right of BRHL Topco: in the event BRHL Topco receives an offer from a third party for the acquisition of a majority of the share capital of BRHL Midco, BRHL Topco shall have the right to cause the Managers to sell 100% of their BRHL MidCo securities. Tag along right: Proportional tag along right: in the event of any direct or indirect transfer of BRHL Midco securities to a third party other than a customary free transfer, the Managers may require to sell the same proportion of BRHL Midco securities to such third party. Total tag along right: in the event of any direct or indirect transfer of BRHL Midco securities to a third party that would result in either (i) such third party holding more than 50% of the BRHL Midco securities other than in connection with a customary free transfer, or (ii) BRHL Topco or its affiliates ceasing to control BRHL\u00a0Midco, the Managers may require to sell all their BRHL Midco securities to such third party. Managers will ultimately benefit from liquidity rights on a portion of the BRHL Midco securities they own in the form of a put option granted by BRHL Topco to each Manager (the \" Liquidity Put Option \"). The exercise price of the Liquidity Put Option will be based on the market value of 100% BRHL Midco securities, as determined based on the most recent quarterly valuation of the Group as set out in reporting to BRHL Topco's ultimate investors or, in case of disagreement, by an independent expert. 1.2.17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Liquidity Agreements The Offeror has offered to the beneficiaries of Unavailable Free Shares, Managers Unavailable Shares (as defined below) and/or Unavailable Holding Shares (together the \" Unavailable Shares \") (the \" Holders of Unavailable Shares \") to enter into commitments to buy and sell their Unavailable Shares in order to enable them to benefit from cash liquidity for the Shares that could not be tendered to the Offer or acquired in the Squeeze-Out (the \" Liquidity Agreement \"). With respect to the Unavailable Free Shares and Managers Unavailable Shares held by Mr. Romain Desrousseaux, in accordance with the Liquidity Agreement, if an Event of Liquidity Default (as defined below) occurs, the Offeror will have a call option (the \" Call Option \"), pursuant to which each Holder of Unavailable Shares irrevocably undertakes to sell to the Offeror its Unavailable Shares at the request of the Offeror at any time during twenty (20) calendar days starting on the sending date of a notice informing each Holder of Unavailable Shares of the availability date of the relevant Unavailable Shares (being specified that such notice shall be sent at the latest five (5) business days as from the availability date of the relevant Unavailable Shares) (the \" Call Option Period \") and, in the absence of exercise of the Call Option during the Call Option Period, Holders of Unavailable Shares will have a put option against the Offeror, pursuant to which the Offeror irrevocably undertakes to acquire from the holder its Unavailable Shares, at any time during a period of sixty (60) calendar days starting on the first business day following the expiry of the Call Option Period (the \" Put Option \", together with the Call Option, the \" Options \"). An \"Event of Liquidity Default\" means: a Squeeze-Out has been implemented by the Offeror, or, the Offeror holds more than 90% of the share capital or voting rights of the Company and the Offeror has not requested to the AMF that a Squeeze-Out be implemented; or the average volume of the Company's shares traded each day over the past twenty (20) trading days is less than 0.055% of the Company\u2019s share capital, on the basis of the information published by Euronext Paris. In accordance with the provisions of the Liquidity Agreement entered into by Mr. Xavier Barbaro (as well as Cartusia, Equinox, Kampen, Hilaris and Palancia), the exercise of the Options on his Unavailable Holding Shares, Unavailable Free Shares and Managers Unavailable Shares is not subject to the occurrence of an Event of Liquidity Default and can be exercised as from the availability date of each category of Unavailable Shares (based on an identical exercise price for all beneficiaries of Unavailable Shares as described below). In addition, with respect to the Managers Unavailable Shares, they must be held (and consequently, the Options cannot be exercised) as long as Mr. Xavier Barbaro and Mr. Romain Desrousseaux respectively hold their positions of corporate officers within the Group and cannot therefore be tendered in the Offer; they are thus covered by the Liquidity Agreements entered into respectively by Mr. Xavier Barbaro and Mr. Romain Desrousseaux and the Options may be exercised after the termination of their respective positions as corporate officers within the Group. In the event of the exercise of an Option, the exercise price per Unavailable Share will be (i) equal to the Offer Price per Share if the Option is exercised before 31 December 2025, or (ii) equal to the market value of the Shares as at the exercice date of the Option according to the terms and conditions of the Liquidity Agreement if the Option is exercised after 31 December 2025 (and, if necessary, determined by an independent expert in the event of disagreement). Should the Squeeze-Out be implemented, the Unavailable Shares (with the exception of the Unavailable PEE Shares and 2023 Accelerated Free Shares, which will be targeted in the Squeeze-Out) which exist as at the date of the Squeeze-Out and for which a Liquidity Agreement has been entered into, will be assimilated to the shares held by the Offeror in accordance with Article L. 233-9 I, 4\u00b0 of the French Commercial Code, and will not be affected by the Squeeze-Out and the delisting. In the event of exercise of the Options, holders of Unavailable Shares would not benefit from any mechanism enabling them to obtain a guaranteed transfer price. It is specified that no contractual mechanism is likely (i) to be analyzed as a price supplement, (ii) to call into question the relevance of the Offer Price per Share or the equal treatment of minority shareholders, or (iii) to highlight a guaranteed transfer price clause in favor of holders of Unavailable Shares. It is further provided that: the beneficiaries of the 2023 Free Share Plan and the 2024 Free Share Plan (including Mr. Xavier Barbaro) are offered by the Offeror the possibility to benefit, subject to an \"Event of Liquidity Default\" (or, in the case of Mr. Xavier Barbaro, subject to a resignation from his position as CEO of the Company following completion of the Squeeze-Out and up to the number of 2024 Free Shares acquired pro rata temporis on the date of termination of his duties), from a cash retention plan in lieu of all or part of their rights to receive these 2023 Free Shares and these 2024 Free Shares, as applicable, under the conditions described in Section 2.4, and as an exception to the above, certain Group executives38F 39 (excluding Mr. Xavier Barbaro) holding 2023 Non-Accelerated Free Shares and 2024 Free Shares (as these terms are defined in Section 2.4), are being offered by the Offeror the opportunity to benefit, subject to an \"Event of Liquidity Default\", from a new retention plan in the form of shares of BRHL Midco (in lieu of all or part of the above-mentioned cash retention plan), under the conditions described in Section 2.4, it being specified that the beneficiaries of the 2023 Free Share Plan and the 2024 Free Share Plan will be able to choose to benefit from the cash retention plan or the retention share plan, as applicable, until 7 February 2025 (inclusive). 1.2.18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other agreements of which the Offeror is aware With the exception of the agreements described in this Section 1.3, there are, to the knowledge of the Offeror, no other agreements likely to have an impact on the assessment or outcome of the Offer. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OFFER 1.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Terms of the Offer In accordance with the provisions of Articles 231-13 and 231-18 of the AMF General Regulation, the draft Offer was filed on 2 January 2025 with the AMF by the Presenting Banks, acting in the name and on behalf of the Offeror. A notice of filing will be published by the AMF on its website ( www.amf-france.org ). In accordance with Articles 233-1 et seq. of the AMF General Regulation, the Offer will be implemented in accordance with the simplified tender offer procedure. The attention of the shareholders and holders of the Company's OCEANEs is drawn to the fact that, as the Offer is being made under the simplified procedure, it will not be reopened following the publication of the result of the Offer. The Offeror irrevocably undertakes to the Company's shareholders and holders of OCEANEs to acquire, all the Shares and OCEANEs that will be tendered in the Offer during a period of 21 Trading Days at the price of: EUR\u00a039.85 per Share, EUR\u00a048.14 per 2020 OCEANE, and EUR\u00a0101,382.00 per 2022 OCEANE.

In the event that, between the date of the Draft Offer Document and the date of the settlement- delivery of the Offer (included), the Company proceeds in any form whatsoever to (i) distribute a dividend, interim dividend, reserve, premium or any other distribution (in cash or in kind), or (ii) redeem or reduce its share capital, and in both cases, in which the detachment date or the reference date on which it is necessary to be a shareholder in order to be entitled thereto is set before the date of the settlement-delivery of the Offer, the Offer Price per Share, the Offer Price per 2020 OCEANE and the Offer Price per 2022 OCEANE will be adjusted to take into account this transaction. Similarly, in the event of transactions involving the share capital of the Company (in particular merger, spinoff, stock split, reverse stock split, distribution of free shares for existing shares through the capitalization of profits or reserves) decided during the same period, and for which the reference date on which any person must be a shareholder in order to receive the distribution is set before the settlement date of the Offer, the Offer Price per Share, the Offer Price per 2020 OCEANE and the Offer Price per 2022 OCEANE will be mechanically adjusted to take into account the effect of any and all such transactions. Any adjustment of the terms of the Offer will be subject to the publication of a press release which will be submitted to the prior approval of the AMF. 1.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Number and nature of the securities targeted by the Offer As of the date of the Draft Offer Document39F 40 , Brookfield Renewable Holdings holds: directly 81,197,100 Shares (i.e. 53.12% of the share capital and 53.19% of the voting rights of the Company), by way of assimilation pursuant to Article L.\u00a0233-9 of the French Commercial Code: the (i) 545,672 Unavailable Holding Shares (i.e. 0.36% of the share capital and theoretical voting rights of the Company) with respect to which Brookfield Renewable Holdings benefits from a Call Option at the Offer Price per Share for each Unavailable Holding Share exercisable as from 16 April 2025, pursuant to the Liquidity Agreement entered into by Mr. Xavier Barbaro (which is described in Section 1.3.3), (ii) 39,943 Managers Unavailable Shares (as defined below and also covered by the Liquidity Agreement entered into by Mr. Xavier Barbaro) held by Mr. Xavier Barbaro, (iii) 1,600 PEE Shares (as defined below) held by Mr. Xavier Barbaro, and (iv) 180,83240F 41 2024 Free Shares (as defined below and also covered by the Liquidity Agreement entered into by Mr. Xavier Barbaro) held by Mr. Xavier Barbaro, the (i) 442,895 Shares, (ii) 9,445 Managers Unavailable Shares (as defined below and covered by the Liquidity Agreement entered into by Mr. Romain Desrousseaux), and (iii) 120,55541F 42 2024 Free Shares (as defined below and also covered by the Liquidity Agreement entered into by Mr. Romain Desrousseaux) held by Mr. Romain Desrousseaux, and 14,330 Shares (i.e. 0.009% of the share capital and theoretical voting rights of the Company) through the intermediary of Aranda Investments (an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Temasek).

As 2022 OCEANEs are trading in percentage of par value, those instruments will be purchased at 101.382% of the par value of EUR 100,000 per 2022 OCEANE, which corresponds to EUR 101,382.00. 1.10.23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Procedure for tendering in the semi-centralised Offer by Euronext Paris A procedure for tendering in the semi-centralised Offer has been set by Euronext Paris to allow for the reimbursement of the brokerage fees by the Offeror, under the conditions described in the Section 2.13 below. Shareholders and holders of OCEANEs of the Company who wish to tender their Shares and/or OCEANEs in the semi-centralized Offer by Euronext Paris must submit their sale offers to the financial intermediary with which their Shares or OCEANEs are deposited no later than the last day of the Offer (subject to specific time limits for certain financial intermediaries). The settlement-delivery will then occur after the completion of the semi-centralization transactions. In this context, the Offeror will bear the brokerage fees of the shareholders and holders of OCEANEs, under the conditions described in Section 2.13 below. Euronext Paris will pay directly to the financial intermediaries the amounts due for the reimbursement of the fees mentioned below, as from the settlement-delivery date of the semi-centralization. 1.11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Offeror's right to purchase Shares and OCEANEs during the Offer period As from the publication by the AMF of the main provisions of the draft Offer, and until the opening of the Offer, the Offeror reserves the right to purchase Shares or OCEANEs, on or off-market, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 231-38 and 231-39 of the AMF General Regulation, within the limits set forth in Article 231-38, IV of the AMF General Regulation, corresponding to a maximum of 30% of the existing Shares, 30% of the existing 2020 OCEANEs and 30% of the existing 2022 OCEANEs targeted by the Offer, respectively at the Offer Price per Share, the Offer Price per 2020 OCEANE and the Offer Price per 2022 OCEANE, i.e. a maximum of 21,214,001 Shares, 1,103,895 2020 OCEANEs and 900 2022 OCEANEs as of the date of the Draft Offer Document.

Shareholders and holders of OCEANEs who sell their Shares and/or OCEANEs in the market will not be entitled to the said refund of brokerage fees (and related VAT). 1.16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Offer restrictions outside of France The Offer has not been subject to any application for registration or approval by any financial market regulatory authority other than the AMF and no measures will be taken in this respect. The Offer is therefore made to shareholders and holders of OCEANEs of the Company located in France and outside France, provided that the local law to which they are subject allows them to take part in the Offer without requiring that the Offeror complete additional formalities. Publication of the Draft Offer Document, the Offer, the acceptance of the Offer and the delivery of the Shares or OCEANEs may, in certain jurisdictions, be subject to specific regulations or restrictions. Accordingly, the Offer is not directed at persons subject to such restrictions, either directly or indirectly, and must not be accepted from any jurisdiction where the Offer is subject to restrictions. Neither the Draft Offer Document nor any other document relating to the Offer constitutes an offer to sell or acquire financial instruments or a solicitation of such an offer in any jurisdiction in which such an offer or solicitation would be unlawful, could not validly be made, or would require the publication of a prospectus or the completion of any other formality under local financial law. Holders of Shares and OCEANEs located outside of France may only participate in the Offer to the extent that such participation is permitted under the local law to which they are subject. Accordingly, persons in possession of the Draft Offer Document are required to obtain information regarding any applicable local restrictions and to comply with such restrictions. Failure to comply with such restrictions may constitute a violation of applicable securities laws. The Offeror shall not be liable for any breach by any person of any applicable legal or regulatory restrictions. United States of America The Offer is being made for the securities of Neoen, a company incorporated under the laws of France, and is subject to French disclosure and procedural requirements, which differ from those of the United States of America. The Offer will be made in the United States of America in accordance with section 14(e) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \" US Exchange Act \"), the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, including Regulation 14E after application of the exemptions provided by Rule 14d-1(d) of the U.S. Exchange Act (the \"Tier II Exemption\") and the requirements of French law. Accordingly, the Offer will be subject to certain disclosure and procedural rules, including those relating to the timing of settlement (including as regards the time when the payment of the consideration is rendered) and the purchase of Shares outside the Offer, which are different from the U.S. rules and practices relating to tender offers in the United States of America. To the extent permissible under applicable laws and regulations, including Rule 14e-5 of the U.S. Exchange Act, and in accordance with French regulations, the Offeror and its affiliates may, directly or indirectly through any financial intermediary, as from the date thereof, and other than pursuant to the Offer, purchase, or arrange, to purchase Shares or OCEANEs, on or off market in accordance with Section 2.9. To the extent that information regarding such purchases or such arrangements is made public in France in accordance with the regulations in force, it will also be made public on the Offeror's website (neoen-offer-brookfield.com) in both French and English language for the purpose of communication to the Company's shareholders and holders of OCEANEs residing in the United States of America as indicated in Section 2.9. In no event will any such purchases be made for a price per Share or OCEANEs that is greater than the respective Offer Price per Share, Offer Price per 2020 OCEANE or Offer Price per 2022 OCEANE. No purchase or arrangement to purchase outside of the Offer will be made by or on behalf of the Offeror in the United States of America. Payment of the Offer price to the U.S. shareholders and holders of OCEANEs may be a taxable transaction subject to income tax, including U.S. federal income tax and may be a taxable transaction pursuant to French national or regional tax laws, as well as foreign or other tax laws. It is strongly recommended that each U.S. shareholder and holder of OCEANEs immediately seeks independent professional advice regarding the tax consequences of accepting the Offer. It may be difficult for U.S. shareholders and holders of OCEANEs to enforce their rights under U.S. federal securities laws because the Offeror and the Company are companies headquartered outside the United States of America and some or all of their respective officers and directors are residents of countries other than the United States of America. The U.S. shareholders and holders of OCEANEs may not be able to bring proceedings in a court outside the United States of America against the Company or its officers or directors alleging violations of U.S. securities laws. In addition, it may also be difficult to compel the Company and its affiliates to comply with judgments rendered by a U.S. court. The Draft Offer Document has not been filed with or reviewed by any federal or state market authority or any other regulatory authority in the United States of America (including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission), and none of those authorities has commented on the accuracy or adequacy of the information contained in the Draft Offer Document. Any statement to the contrary would be illegal and could constitute a criminal offence. For the purposes of the foregoing paragraphs, the U.S. and the United States mean the United States of America, its territories and possessions, or any of those States and the District of Columbia. 1.17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tax regime of the Offer The tax regime of the Offer is described in Section 2.15 \"Tax regime of the Offer\" of the Draft Offer Document.
