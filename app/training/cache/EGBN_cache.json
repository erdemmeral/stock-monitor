Positive Points Eagle Bancorp Inc ( NASDAQ:EGBN ) reported net income of $15.3 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting a proactive approach to managing valuation risk. The company successfully moved a $74.9 million office loan to nonaccrual status while maintaining contractual payments, indicating strong asset management. Eagle Bancorp Inc ( NASDAQ:EGBN ) achieved significant deposit growth of $590.2 million in the fourth quarter, allowing for the full repayment of $1 billion in bank term funding program debt. The company strengthened its C&I team to deepen relationships and grow deposits and fee income, key components of its profitability strategy. Eagle Bancorp Inc ( NASDAQ:EGBN ) maintains a strong capital position with a common equity tier one ratio increase of 33 basis points to 14.63%. Negative Points Net interest income declined due to a $369,165 reversal from interest income because of the migration to nonaccrual of a significant office loan. Nonperforming loans increased to $208.7 million at the end of the fourth quarter, driven by the office loan, raising concerns about asset quality. The company experienced a decline in net interest margin by eight basis points to 2.29% in the fourth quarter. Higher noninterest expenses and lower fee income contributed to a decline in pretax income by $6.9 million to $19.8 million. Eagle Bancorp Inc ( NASDAQ:EGBN ) faced a 44% decline in the appraised value of a significant office loan, leading to a $9 million charge-off. Q & A Highlights Q : Can you provide more details on the office loan that was downgraded this quarter and how it affects your view on portfolio risk, especially with upcoming 2026 maturities? A : Susan Riel, President and CEO, explained that the focus is on all office properties, both suburban and central business district. The decline in face values is more severe in central business districts. The recent appraisal showed a significant drop in value, but there is cautious optimism due to increased leasing activity and reduced concessions. The team is actively managing these risks and working with borrowers to mitigate potential impacts. Story Continues Q : What are the potential impacts of the new administration's plans to sell federal government office space on your portfolio? A : Susan Riel noted that Eagle Bancorp has minimal exposure to GSA leases, which are primarily in larger properties in the central business district. The administration's plans to privatize government occupancy could lead to more leasing opportunities for properties with significant floor plates. However, the properties being sold are likely B minus or C plus, requiring significant rehabilitation. Q : How is the merger of a large in-market competitor affecting Eagle Bancorp, and what opportunities does it present? A : Susan Riel and Eric Newell, CFO, see the merger as an opportunity for Eagle Bancorp to become the largest community bank in the area, potentially gaining new business and talent. The team is analyzing shared customers to increase market share and deepen relationships. Q : What is the outlook for reserves and credit costs in 2025? A : Eric Newell stated that they do not anticipate significant reserve builds beyond specific reserves for individually assessed loans. The office overlay is considered adequate, and credit costs are expected to range between 25 to 50 basis points for 2025. Q : Can you discuss the balance sheet outlook and the impact of excess liquidity and deposit growth? A : Eric Newell mentioned that there is no expected growth in the bond portfolio, with a focus on reducing its percentage to assets. Excess liquidity is expected to be utilized in the loan portfolio, contributing to an improved net interest margin in 2025.

Positive Points Freeport-McMoRan Inc ( NYSE:FCX ) achieved $10 billion in EBITDA for 2024, a 14% increase from 2023. The company reported operating cash flows of over $7 billion in 2024, a 35% improvement from the previous year. Freeport-McMoRan Inc ( NYSE:FCX ) is focused on scaling its leach opportunity, targeting a run rate of 300 million pounds by the end of 2025. The company has a strong financial position with a net debt of approximately $1 billion, providing flexibility for future investments. Freeport-McMoRan Inc ( NYSE:FCX ) is advancing several organic growth projects, including brownfield expansions in the US and South America. Negative Points The company is facing challenges with obtaining export permits from the Indonesian government, which could impact production rates. Freeport-McMoRan Inc ( NYSE:FCX ) is dealing with the aftermath of a fire at its Indonesian smelter, requiring repairs and impacting operations. The company is subject to a 7.5% export tax in Indonesia, which affects its cost structure. There is uncertainty regarding the timeline for legislative approval of a 10% tax credit for copper as a critical mineral in the US. Freeport-McMoRan Inc ( NYSE:FCX ) faces geopolitical risks, particularly in Indonesia, which could impact its operations and financial performance. Q & A Highlights Q : Can you provide more details on the approval to export concentrate from Indonesia and its potential impact on production rates? A : We are making good progress with the Indonesian government and expect to receive export approval in the near term. Our inventories are building, but if we get the export permit as expected in the coming weeks, we will be able to start shipping exports and manage inventory levels effectively. - Kathleen Quirk, President and CEO Story Continues Q : What are the next steps for copper to qualify for the 10% tax credit, and is it possible in 2025? A : The tax credit qualification depends on US legislation. A bill passed the House last year, and further legislative processes are needed. While we can't predict the timing, there is bipartisan support, and it remains possible for 2025. This would be significant, potentially providing a $500 million benefit. - Kathleen Quirk, President and CEO Q : Regarding discretionary CapEx for 2025, is the $400 million for Bagdad tailings infrastructure tied to expansion, and what about the $600 million at Kucing Liar? A : The Bagdad tailings infrastructure is not immediately necessary and could be deferred if we don't proceed with expansion. The $3.5 billion capital for Bagdad is incremental, excluding tailings. For Kucing Liar, the investment supports long-term production sustainability at Grasberg, aligning with our plans to maintain high production rates. - Kathleen Quirk, President and CEO Q : How does Freeport view geopolitical risks, particularly in Indonesia, and is M&A a potential strategy for diversification? A : We have confidence in our long-term operations in Indonesia, supported by a strong history. We are excited about opportunities in the Americas, especially in the US, with initiatives like the leach project. While we monitor M&A opportunities, our strategy focuses on organic growth and value creation without relying on acquisitions. - Kathleen Quirk, President and CEO Q : Is there insurance coverage for the additional work to fix the fire at the Grasberg smelter, and what is the timeline for the license extension with the new Indonesian government? A : The repair cost of approximately $100 million is covered by insurance. We are engaged with the new Indonesian government and hope to apply for the license extension during 2025, aligning with the smelter's full integration and meeting regulatory requirements. - Kathleen Quirk, President and CEO For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .

(EGBN) Stock? Zacks Equity Research Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 5:40 PM 3 min read In This Article: EGBN -3.47% Here at Zacks, our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system, which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks. Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks. Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks. In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's \"Value\" category.

This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.86. Finally, our model also underscores that EGBN has a P/CF ratio of 10.74.

Announces Fourth Quarter 2024 Results and Cash Dividend GlobeNewswire \u00b7 GlobeNewswire Inc. Eagle Bancorp, Inc. Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 12:15 AM 30 min read In This Article: EGBN -3.47% BETHESDA, Md., Jan. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eagle Bancorp, Inc. (\"Eagle\", the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: EGBN), the Bethesda-based holding company for EagleBank, one of the largest community banks in the Washington D.C. area, reported its unaudited results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2024. Eagle reported net income of $15.3 million or $0.50 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2024, compared to net income of $21.8 million or $0.72 per diluted share during the third quarter. Pre-provision net revenue (\"PPNR\") 1 in the fourth quarter was $30.3 million compared to $35.2 million for the prior quarter. The $6.5 million decrease in net income from the prior quarter is attributed to a decline in noninterest income of $2.9 million associated with higher swap fees collected in the third quarter that did not reoccur in the fourth quarter; $2.0 million increase in provision expense; $1.0 million decrease in net interest income, and a $0.9 million increase in noninterest expenses. Additionally, the Company is announcing today a cash dividend in the amount of $0.165 per share. The cash dividend will be payable on February 21, 2025 to shareholders of record on February 7, 2025. \"Last year was a transformative one for our Company, marked by significant changes and progress. We welcomed new members to senior management and strengthened our C&I team. We took steps to reduce uncertainties by replacing maturing subordinated debt, recalibrated our common stock dividend, and enhanced transparency around our commercial real estate portfolio,\" said Susan G. Riel, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. \"Despite these foundational efforts, challenges remain. Asset quality fell short of expectations and valuation risk in our office portfolio continues to be a key concern. While we are proud of the groundwork laid last year, we are eager to build on these efforts and drive meaningful improvements in our profitability,\" added Ms. Riel. Eric R. Newell, Chief Financial Officer of the Company said, \"We successfully utilized excess liquidity and deposit growth to fully repay the $1 billion of Bank Term Funding Program debt that was outstanding at September 30. By prioritizing more effective use of wholesale funding and passing through short-term rate reductions to non-maturity deposits, we expect further benefits to funding costs in the first half of 2025. While non-accruals increased due to a $74.9 million commercial real estate office loan that was previously special mention and subsequently moved to non-accrual following a new appraisal, total classified and criticized loans declined last quarter for the first time since we began seeing migration tied to elevated office portfolio risk. The reserve for credit losses, with coverage as a percentage of total loans at 1.44%, increased 4 basis points from last quarter due in large part to the migration to nonaccrual of the previously special mention performing office loan. Our capital position remains strong, with common equity tier one capital increasing to 14.6% and our tangible common equity 1 ratio exceeding 10%.\" Story Continues Ms. Riel added, \"I thank all of our employees for their hard work and their commitment to a culture of respect, diversity and inclusion in both the workplace and the communities we serve.\" Fourth Quarter 2024 Highlights The Company announces today a common stock dividend of $0.165 per share. The ACL as a percentage of total loans was 1.44% at quarter-end; up from 1.40% at the prior quarter-end. Performing office coverage 2 was 3.81% at quarter-end; as compared to 4.55% at the prior quarter-end. Nonperforming assets increased $74.3 million to $211.5 million as of December 31, 2024 and were 1.90% of total assets compared to 1.22% as of September 30, 2024. Inflows to non-performing loans in the quarter totaled $75.3 million offset by $1.0 million of outflows. The inflows were predominantly associated with the $74.9 million commercial real estate office loan mentioned earlier. Substandard loans increased $34.7 million to $426.0 million and special mention loans decreased $120.2 million to $244.8 million at December 31, 2024. Annualized quarterly net charge-offs for the fourth quarter were 0.48% compared to 0.26% for the third quarter 2024. The net interest margin (\"NIM\") decreased to 2.29% for the fourth quarter 2024, compared to 2.37% for the prior quarter, primarily due to an increase in the average mix of interest-bearing deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. At quarter-end, the common equity ratio, tangible common equity ratio 1 , and common equity tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) ratio were 11.02%, 11.02%, and 14.63%, respectively. Total estimated insured deposits at quarter-end were $7.0 billion, or 76.4% of deposits, an increase from the third quarter total of 74.5% of deposits. Total on-balance sheet liquidity and available capacity was $4.6 billion at quarter-end consistent with September 30, 2024. Income Statement Net interest income was $70.8 million for the fourth quarter 2024, compared to $71.8 million for the prior quarter. The decrease in net interest income was primarily driven by $965 thousand interest income not recognized on a loan that migrated to nonaccrual during the quarter. While interest income declined due to lower rates on loans, there was a similar decline in interest expense from a reduction in rates on non-maturity deposits and a reduction in borrowings. Provision for credit losses was $12.1 million for the fourth quarter 2024, compared to $10.1 million for the prior quarter. The increase in the provision for the quarter is attributed predominately to a specific reserve established for the $74.9 million commercial real estate office loan mentioned earlier. Reserve for unfunded commitments was a reversal of $1.6 million due primarily to lower unfunded commitments in our construction portfolio. This compared to a reversal for unfunded commitments in the prior quarter of $1.6 million. Noninterest income was $4.1 million for the fourth quarter 2024, compared to $7.0 million for the prior quarter. The primary driver for the decrease was lower swap fee income. Noninterest expense was $44.5 million for the fourth quarter 2024, compared to $43.6 million for the prior quarter. The increase over the comparative quarters was primarily due to increased FDIC insurance expense. Loans and Funding Total loans were $7.9 billion at December 31, 2024, down 0.4% from the prior quarter-end. The decrease in total loans was driven by a reduction in income producing commercial real estate loans from the prior quarter-end, partially offset by an increase in commercial and industrial loans and increased fundings of ongoing construction projects for commercial and residential properties. At December 31, 2024, income-producing commercial real estate loans secured by office properties other than owner-occupied properties were 10.9% of the total loan portfolio, up from 10.8% at the prior quarter-end. Total deposits at quarter-end were $9.1 billion, up $590.2 million, or 6.9%, from the prior quarter-end. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in interest-bearing transaction and savings and money market accounts. Period end deposits have increased $323.0 million when compared to prior year comparable period end of December 31, 2023. Other short-term borrowings were $0.5 billion at December 31, 2024, down 60.5% from the prior quarter-end as BTFP borrowings were paid off with increased cash from deposits. Asset Quality Allowance for credit losses was 1.44% of total loans held for investment at December 31, 2024, compared to 1.40% at the prior quarter-end. Performing office coverage was 3.81% at quarter-end; as compared to 4.55% at the prior quarter-end. Net charge-offs were $9.5 million for the quarter compared to $5.3 million in the third quarter of 2024. Nonperforming assets were $211.5 million at December 31, 2024. NPAs as a percentage of assets were 1.90% at December 31, 2024, compared to 1.22% at the prior quarter-end. At December 31, 2024, other real estate owned consisted of four properties with an aggregate carrying value of $2.7 million. The increase in NPAs was predominantly associated with the previously mentioned $74.9 million commercial real estate office loan moving to non-accrual. Loans 30-89 days past due were $26.8 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $56.3 million at the prior quarter-end. Capital Total shareholders' equity was $1.2 billion at December 31, 2024, up 0.1% from the prior quarter-end. The increase in shareholders' equity of $0.6 million was due to an increase in retained earnings offset by decreased valuations of available-for-sale securities. Book value per share and Tangible book value per share 3 was $40.60 and $40.59, down 0.02% from the prior quarter-end.

The Company calculates the tangible common equity ratio by excluding the balance of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity, or tangible common equity, and dividing by tangible assets. The Company calculates tangible book value per common share by dividing tangible common equity by common shares outstanding, as compared to book value per common share, which the Company calculates by dividing common shareholders' equity by common shares outstanding. The Company calculates the annualized return on average tangible common equity ratio by dividing net income available to common shareholders by average tangible common equity, which is calculated by excluding the average balance of intangible assets from the average common shareholders' equity. Further related to other measures, tangible equity is a measure that is consistent with the calculation of capital for bank regulatory purposes, which excludes intangible assets from the calculation of risk based ratios, and as such is useful for investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate capital adequacy and to compare against other financial institutions. The efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure calculated by dividing GAAP noninterest expense by the sum of GAAP net interest income and GAAP noninterest income. The efficiency ratio measures a bank's overhead as a percentage of its revenue. The Company believes that reporting the non-GAAP efficiency ratio more closely measures its effectiveness of controlling operational activities. Pre-provision net revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by subtracting noninterest expenses from the sum of net interest income and noninterest income. The Company considers this information important to shareholders because it illustrates revenue excluding the impact of provisions and reversals to the allowance for credit losses on loans. 1 A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and the nearest GAAP measures is provided in the GAAP Reconciliation to Non-GAAP Financial Measure that accompany this document. 2 Calculated as the ACL attributable to loans collateralized by performing office properties as a percentage of total loans. 3 A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and the nearest GAAP measures is provided in the GAAP Reconciliation to Non-GAAP Financial Measure that accompany this document.

Our periodic reports are available from the company online at our website or on the S ECs website. With me today is our President and CEO Susan Real Kevin Gahan and Jan Williams. I'd like to now turn it over to Susan. Susan Riel Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported net income of $15.3 million for the quarter. This result reflects our our proactive approach to navigating valuation risk particularly through an increased provision for credit losses. As part of the effort, we moved a $74.9 million office loan to nonaccrual status due to a new appraisal. This loan continues to make contractual payments and the property's improving fundamentals gives us cautious optimism as we manage through this challenging environment. Our team remains focused on executing a disciplined strategy that positions Eagle Bank and our clients for long term success. Even amid evolving market dynamics, the enhanced loan disclosures introduced last quarter, reflect our commitment to transparency, helping stakeholders better understand the risk we see and how we are addressing them. Looking back on 2024 we made significant progress toward building a foundation for sustainable growth. We strengthened our C&I team to deepen relationships and grow deposits and fee income. Key components of our profitability strategy. Fourth quarter, deposit growth of $all590.2 millionowed us to fully repay $1 billion in bank term funding program debt. A testament to our strength, the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity management. As we look ahead, our geographic presence in the DMV, our role as a top local commercial lender and our deep, deeply rooted relationship. First values create a strong competitive advantage. These qualities enable us to adapt to change and deliver solutions that build trust and long term value for our clients. The entire team is energized by the progress we've made and the opportunities ahead with the groundwork laid in 2024. We are confident in our ability to execute on our strategic goals and deliver results for our shareholders. With that, I will turn things over to Jan. Story Continues Janice Williams Thank you, Susan. Our asset quality metrics were impacted by the migration of an office loan from special mention to nonapproval substandard in the fourth quarter while the office loan was cured in December because of our extension to September 2025. A new appraisal was obtained. The new appraisal showed a 44% decline in value since the date of the last appraisal in May of 2022 the borrower is cash flowing and continues to be current on payment. There are indications of improvement in the market. We've seen increases in leasing activity and positive net absorption in the fourth quarter of 2024 cash flow from properties and transactions are occurring at higher valuations than recent appraisals. At the same time, appraisals remain inherently backward looking and are heavily dependent on historical comparables. So an appraisal today may not fully capture current market trends as more market transactions occur. We would anticipate less volatility and appraisals. Given the outcome of the appraisal, we individually evaluated the loan and took a charge off of $9 million, more than two thirds of which was already contained in the reserve. The loan was placed on nonaccrual. We believe the loan remains adequately reserved at this time, the balance of the loan is $74.9 million. Since late 2020. We've been sweeping cash flow and building reserves for build out on new leases and payment reserves. We continue to sweep excess cash flow and continue building additional reserves. Details about the loan are included on page 23 and 24 of our earnings debt net charge offs totaled $9.5 million in the fourth quarter resulting in 2024 charge offs of $38.6 million or 48 basis points. During the quarter, we upgraded two separate office loans that were previously special mention and substandard to pass for one of those loans. We worked with the borrower to secure a three year extension with three principal curtailments, putting the bank in a better position and allowing the borrower to continue exploring redevelopment of the property to multifamily. On the other. We received a curtailment that resulted in a reduced loan to value of less than 70%. We also saw an upgrade in the quarter of a $46.3 million hotel loan from special mention to pass rated with improved operations. A multifamily loan of $30 million was upgraded from substandard to pass as a result of additional cash reserves sufficient to support a preplanned hud exit two C&I loans totaling $26.5 million were upgraded from substandard to special mention due to direct assignment of contract proceeds more than sufficient to repay the debt other downgrades. In addition to the office loan of $74.9 million in the quarter included a $36.8 million owner occupied industrial commercial real estate property, substandard loans increased $35.1 million during the fourth quarter to end at $426.4 million. Special mention decreased $120.2 million during the quarter to end at $244.8 million. This represents overall positive migration of our criticized and classified loans for the fourth quarter. We note in our disclosure on page 20 of our earnings presentation that 69% of our classified and criticized loans are performing following the migration of the aforementioned office loan to nonaccrual. During the fourth quarter. Nonperforming loans were $208.7 million at December 31st, an increase of $74.3 million from September 30th driven by the office loan. Nonperforming assets to total assets were 1.9%. An increase of 68 basis points from the prior quarter loans 30 to 89 days past due were $22 million at December 31st, decreasing from $56.3 million at September 30th. Eric. Eric Newell Thanks Jen. We reported net income for the quarter following $15.3 million or $0.50 per diluted share. This compares to the prior quarter of $21.8 million or $0.72 per diluted share. Pretax income declined $6.9 million to $19.8 million. In the fourth quarter. The decline in net interest income, higher provision for credit losses, lower fee income and higher noninterest expenses contributed to the pretax decline. Taxes were largely unchanged from the fourth quarter despite lower pretax income due to return to provision adjustment and uncertain tax benefit representing $2.2 million of tax expense in the quarter. This was partially offset by a $1.7 million tax benefit from an investment tax credit purchased during the quarter. Our capital position remains strong. Tier one leverage ratio decreased three basis points to 10.74%. As average assets increased slightly more than tier one capital quarter over quarter, common equity, tier one ratio increased 33 basis points to 14.63%. Tangible common equity ratio increased 16 basis points to 11.02% at quarter. End book value per share decreased a penny to $40.60 per share. As unrealized losses increased due to higher market rates at December 31 compared to the prior quarter. End on balance sheet and contingent liquidity also remains strong. Average deposits have grown $585.1 million from a year ago at December 31 2023. A significant amount of this annual growth was achieved through our digital channel. Our one way broker deposits increased $234 million from the comparable 2023 period end due to contractual nonmaturity brokered funding funding relationships. We reduce brokered cds throughout the year and expect to resize our contractual nonmaturity brokered relationships in 2025 growth in deposits in the second half of 2024 facilitated our ability to fully pay off early. Our $1 billion of bank term funding program borrowings that were outstanding at September 30th insured deposits total 76% of our total deposits at the end of the quarter available liquidity from the federal home loan bank, federal reserve discount, window, cash and unencumbered securities totaled $4.6 billion net interest income before provision totaled totaled $70.8 million in the fourth quarter, decreasing from $71.8 million in the third quarter. Net interest income declined because of 369 165,000 reversal from interest income due to the migration to non accrual of the previously discussed office loan nim declined eight basis points from the third quarter to 2.29%. Generally, we saw interest income and interest expense decline proportionately to one another. The shift in mix of average earning assets with a higher proportion of interest earning deposits was the largest contributor to the decline in them. Of the $162.6 million of funded loan originations in the quarter, we had a weighted average rate of 7.68%. This compares to $91.2 million of funded loan originations at a weighted average rate of 7.11% in the third quarter. Management has reduced rates paid on non maturity deposits due to declining interest rates following the decisions by the FOMC to ease the policy rate by 25 basis points each in November and December, we reduced rates on for nonmature deposits by a cumulative 50 basis points. This follows our actions taken to reduce nonmature deposit rates from the FOMC easing earlier in the fall, noninterest income decreased as the third quarter. Items such as the sale of MSRS income from SBIC investments as well as income from back to back swap transactions did not reoccur in the fourth quarter in early January management added to its bank owned life insurance policies which will increase the run rate of cash surrender value growth and related income starting in the first quarter, noninterest expense to $44.5 million increasing from $43.6 million in the previous quarter. Salaries and benefits increased due to a true up on severance for a departing employee and a higher compensation expense due to forfeitures of sharebased compensation in the third quarter which did not repeat in the fourth quarter. Marketing and advertising declined because of lower spend on our digital channel, legal accounting and professional expenses declined and were offset by higher FD expenses in our quarterly investor debt release along with earnings. We updated our view on 2025. Our thoughts on period and growth of loans next year remain between two and 8% though the slide shows average growth earning asset growth is flat as we continue to take cash flows from our investment portfolio and reinvest in loans with our budgeting process completed management has a more precise view of the net interest margin. As noted last quarter, there is an expected benefit from this repositioning of the investment portfolio and loan mix that is expected to enhance spread growing relationship deposits and reducing and optimizing the use of wholesale funding are also expected to contribute to spread. I'll turn it over to Kevin to discuss our ACL. Thank you, Eric, as Jane mentioned, net charge offs increased $4.2 million from the third quarter to $9.5 million. We will continue to evaluate the sufficiency of our qualitative reserves to address market uncertainties. However, we currently expect that any future reserve increases will stem from specific reserves for individually assessed loans. Should there be a significant shift in economic expectations not accounted for in our qualitative reserves that would be reflected in the inputs we use to inform our model and that could result in increases in reserve reserves. Last quarter, we mentioned the future reserve bill if any would be driven by specific reserves from invi individually evaluated loans. This is in fact the driver of the allowance for credit losses during the quarter. In addition to specific reserves associated with the office loan discussed previously, we increased our specific reserves for an assisted living relationship, which is number three on our nonaccrual loan listing on page 23 of our investor deck. The allowance for credit losses increased to $114 million at 1,231 representing coverage of total loans at 1.44% an increase of four bits from the prior quarter. The AC L coverage to, to performing office loans totals 3.81% at 1,231 down from 4.55% at 930 due to the reserves associated with the office loan following it into the individually evaluated specific reserves. Finally, we continue to believe that our reserves are adequate. I'll turn it over to Susan for a short wrap up. Susan Riel Thanks Kevin. The team completed foundational actions last year to support our strategic goals growing and diversifying building relationship deposits and focusing on operational excellence. While it will take time to reach our our operational goals, we are beginning to see early successes that will drive results. At the same time, we remain focused on addressing asset quality concerns and mitigating valuation risk. As office loans approach maturity as a community focused bank, we take pride in being deeply connected to the communities. We serve this commitment sets us apart and positions Eagle Bank to thrive amid evolving market dynamics in the DMV. In closing, I want to thank our dedicated employees. Your hard work makes Eagle Bank a success and ensures we continue to deliver value to our customers and stakeholders. With that, we will now open things up for questions. Question and Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions) Justin Crowley with Piper Sandler. Justin Crowley Hey, good morning everyone. I just want to hit on the office loan that got downgraded in the quarter. You know, obviously, reappraisal volatility has been an issue overall, but I maybe thought some of these class a buildings particularly in areas like Montgomery County were a bit more inflated from that risk. You know, does this situation change at all? How you're thinking about that sort of risk as you look across the portfolio outside what's in DC, central business district. And especially as we move through the year and get closer to some of these larger loans with 2026 maturities. Susan Riel Yeah, I think we are and have been focused on all office, whether suburban or central business district and the severity of the decline in face values is much more in the central business district and is ameliorated to a certain extent in the suburbs that said different appraisers have different perspective on appropriate cap rates, leasing rates, discount rates. It's for me personally, I was surprised to see a discount rate of 11% in a class, a suburban market with increased leasing activity. On the other hand, we can see that overall the time to stabilization has been reduced to the current leasing activity. You're looking at this particular property of a stabilized value of about 100 and $10 million So, that's in 2027. So I think you're going to see changes as the pace of leasing increases or decreases in this particular class of building. I have cautious optimism that we are going to be in a position to continue. If you took a look at, there's one other similar property that you may have thought of. That's an office property of similar size that is also in Montgomery County and that is on our TOP25 list that we provided in our deck. That's number two on that list. And that particular property was appraised in February of 2023. And compared to the May of 2022 appraisal on the property that we just placed into nonperforming status, there was a 44% drop in valuation the appraisal from May 22 until January of 2025 if you kind of extrapolate from there, and this would just be a ballpark swag and took 44% decline in appraised value on the office property that comes up for reappraisal in 2026. You'd be looking at a potential $3 million charge up. So I don't think it's a staggering number. You may have different discounts that you're looking at and you may feel that different C grades apply and that, matter of judgment. But I think we're on top of these and continuing to work with borrowers. One of the things that really helped us on the property that became nonperforming was the fact that we had been sleeping cash flow for a significant period of time. And that assisted us both in the collateral valuation and also in the ability to continue forward and fund any T I work that is necessary in connection with valueadd leasing. So I know there is T I work in progress right now on a particular new lease. I have cau cautious optimism on that front. Did that answer your question? Justin Crowley Yeah. No, that's helpful. And just for, I guess just a little further detail, you noted just some of the improving fundamentals on that property that moved to nonaccrual this quarter. Can you unpack that just a little more just in terms of what the leasing activity activities look like or occupancy levels? And you know, maybe how that squares with the other loan that's currently on special mention that you had called out. Susan Riel Well, I can tell you that the leasing activity has been fairly consistent over the last couple of years in that it's managed to sustain occupancy in a difficult market, but it's tipped up right now. And what we're seeing are reductions in concessions in addition to a more rapid lease up period to get stabilization. I think you've you know, at one point maybe two years ago in the summer, we were looking at $100 and $80 a foot T I allowances and not an eyebrow was raised at that. And now we're down around $95 a foot. So I think effective gross rents are increasing and we are also seeing more activity both in this property and in very similar proximate properties. So I have optimism on that. Justin Crowley Okay. Got it. And then I guess, somewhat relatedly, with the new administration in place. Now there have been some headlines in recent days describing, the potential for some large scale sales of federal government office space and canceling of leases, et cetera, which would of course, likely take some time to play out. But are you able to provide any detail on direct exposure to government office and then, I know it's early but just any preliminary thoughts on, the impact moves out of the GS A could potentially have on your book. Susan Riel We have very little exposure to GSA. I think those properties that had large G A leases were for the most part in the C MD F market. Those are bigger properties. And at the time, I think GS A lease was thought to be as good as you could get on leasing that certainly has changed. At least the chatter around it has changed at this point, I do think it pulls two ways it appears the administration believes that the private sector can provide occupancy to the government less expensively than the government is providing it to itself and do a better job. I don't think it's a huge surprise that this administration would want to privatize that activity. So I would expect they would be trying to sell some properties some in this area, some across the country. I do think that means there's going to be more leasing as a result of the concurrent directive for federal employees to go back to the office, there has to be some place for them to go. So there could be for properties that have significant floor plates available that are in the B plus A minus area, that might be something that could see an uptick with the federal government leasing. I do think the properties that they're contemplating selling appear to be B minus C plus properties and it will take a significant period. I think for those properties to be rehabbed and brought back to the market and just one person's thoughts on it. Justin Crowley Okay. That's helpful. And then, shifting gears a little, there's obviously a larger in market competitor who's involved in the you know, merger transaction right now. You know, to what extent has it already created some opportunity for you folks or you know, how do you think any dislocation could play out from your standpoint, whether that's new business or, or opportunity to add talent. Eric Newell You, Susan, you want to take. Susan Riel We think it will bring opportunities for us. So we'll be the largest, community banker in this area. And we think that will be mean opportunities for us. Of course, there will be opportunities with people and you know, there are some shared customers that we already have, with them. So, we're, we're looking at it as a positive for us, Eric, you want to add anything. Janice Williams There is a team that has mobilized to analyze where we share customers. If there's opportunities for us to get greater market or a greater wallet share of that shared customer, we think that there will be opportunities around milestones in that transaction when there's a legal close, when there's a conversion and we hope to be able to share our value proposition and deepen the relationships that we share, share customers with them as well as acquire new customers. Okay, great. I appreciate the time this morning. Thank you. Operator Katherine Miller with KVW. Katherine Miller Thanks. Good morning. Susan Riel Morning. Katherine Miller Maybe just one back on credit as we think about your outlook for the reserve and, and you know, I know it's kind of hard to put a range on reserve bills and, and the charge off. But as you can see here today and you think about your potential exposure, would, would you expect to continue to see reserve bills throughout the course of 25 or do you think we're at a place today? It certainly was good to see less inflows of, of you know, substandard and special mission credits, which makes me feel like maybe we're at a, at a peak in our allowance. Just curious, your thoughts on that. Thank you. Eric Newell Yeah, in our budgeting process, we do not currently anticipate any reserve bill beyond what Kevin's comments talked about in the sense that if there's a an idiosyncratic issue with a credit that requires us to individually evaluate that loan there, there could be noise there. But we do, we feel that the office overlay that is a qualitative approach that we're addressing concerns as we see it for office, we feel that that is adequate at this point. I believe last call, I put a range out on credit costs. I think it was 25 to 50 basis points for 2025. And we continue to expect that to be the range. And that's provisioning versus charge also, I guess maybe they're kind of in the same range. Without the without. Janice Williams Yeah, I look, I look at it as kind of the same thing because without a reserve build, you're kind of you're you're going in and out. Katherine Miller Makes sense. Susan Riel But you know, thinking about what we achieved in '24. Actually in the last 18 months ending December 31, '24 I think at June 30th, our, our reserve was approximately 100 basis points to loans and now we're at 144 basis points to loans. We've achieved a lot of build over that 18 months. And based on the information that we have today, we believe that that is adequate. Katherine Miller Okay, great. And then on the outlook for the balance sheet, there's a big build in the balance sheet from the excess liquidity and deposit growth this quarter. And so I thought it was interesting that your guy for average earning assets was flat. I would think maybe you might see a little bit of the decline is that, as we just kind of some of that excess liquidity to work, but still we're coming from such a larger average earning asset base at the end of the year. Just curious your thoughts on that. As we kind of think about excess liquidity kind of into the bond book and into loan growth. Susan Riel We're not currently expecting any growth in the bond portfolio. And in fact, our goal is to get the percentage of the bond portfolio to assets into the 10s. I think Charles was saying around 15% and we're above that and that is one of the reasons why in our budgeting process, you can see that there was an improvement in our outlook on them for 2025 versus what we previously had disclosed in last quarter, you have about 385 million of cash flows that are currently earning us around 2% that are expected to go into the loan portfolio or even cash. In this case. I mean, that's not really what our goal is. We want to go into the loan portfolio which materially contributes to an increase in spread the comment about the average balance sheet. It is true that we had some excess cash on throughout the fourth quarter. We do have expectations that that would be utilized, better utilized into the loan portfolio as well in 2025. Katherine Miller And I've noticed that you've made a couple of new hires in the C&I line of business, any commentary there and just thoughts on your loan growth, how much of that's coming in C&I versus CRE. Susan Riel We're, we're already seeing positive results from the changes that we've made in the C&I area with bringing Evelyn lee in as the head of the C&I group and with the strategic hires that we have made so far, we're seeing increased activity in that area in a very, very positive way. Katherine Miller In terms of growth, Catherine. Yeah, our CRE team is is seeing payoffs in the multi family space particularly, we saw some in the fourth quarter. I think we're expecting more in the first quarter. And I believe Ryan made a comment about some expected payoffs in the second quarter as well. And what that will allow us to do is we can opt to, depending on the pipelines, we can opt to work on any types of activity that the CRE might be seeing. And then also use some of that capacity to in terms of cash flows coming back to us and redeploy that in our C&I. Portfolio. We're really looking at our CRE concentration coming down too as a result of that, those payoffs.Which is a big focus of ours is reducing our CRE concentration ratio. Katherine Miller Yes, for sure, for sure. Okay, great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Susan Riel Thanks, Katherine. Operator Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to President and CEO Susan Riel for closing remarks. Susan Riel I'd like to thank everyone for your questions and for you taking the time to join us today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Have a great day. Operator This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.
