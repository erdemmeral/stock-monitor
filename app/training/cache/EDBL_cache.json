Non-Binding Letter of Intent to Acquire NARAYAN GROUP to Expand into the European and North American Markets Edible Garden AG Incorporated Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 3:15 PM 12 min read In This Article: EDBL -2.44% EDBLW +5.56% Edible Garden AG Incorporated BELVIDERE, NJ, Jan. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Edible Garden AG Incorporated (\u201cEdible Garden\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (Nasdaq: EDBL, EDBLW) , a leader in controlled environment agriculture (CEA), locally grown, organic, and sustainable produce and products, today announced the signing of a non-binding letter of intent (LOI) to purchase the outstanding share capital of Narayan d.o.o. and its subsidiaries (\u201cNarayan Group\u201d), a prominent producer of organic coconut and superfood products. The Narayan Group, headquartered in Slovenia, brings established products characterized by consistent revenue growth and EBITDA 1 with significant market reach that has achieved over $22 Million in revenue 2 during the first nine months of 2024. Narayan expects fourth quarter revenue in excess of $9.5 Million, which would result in expected annual revenue of approximately $31.5 Million for the year ending December 31, 2024. 3 With Narayan\u2019s vertically integrated supply chain and leadership in the European market combining with Edible Garden\u2019s innovative CEA technology and product placement within their North American distribution network on a combined basis, the Narayan Group and Edible Garden expect to achieve combined revenues in excess of $60 Million in 2025. 4 The Narayan Group has demonstrated consistent positive EBITDA 1 , with net sales revenue growing steadily from $12.1 Million in 2020 to $26.9 Million in 2023. The Narayan Group generated net income of $0.9 Million and EBITDA 1 of $3.0 Million in 2023 and is expected to report increased revenues and EBITDA 1 for fiscal 2024. Mario Brumat, CEO of Narayan Group, stated, \u201cWe believe this strategic transaction with Edible Garden represents a transformative opportunity to combine Narayan\u2019s high-growth business model and strong European market leadership with Edible Garden\u2019s innovative CEA technology and established distribution channels in North America. Together, we expect to be able to accelerate market expansion, particularly in the U.S. and Canada, by delivering products that meet rising consumer demand for organic and sustainable food products. We anticipate this collaboration will drive operational efficiencies, and provide cross selling opportunities of our combined product lines throughout North America and Europe which should provide immediate short-term and sustainable long-term shareholder value through scalable growth and increased market share in the growing market sector we are addressing.\u201d Jim Kras, CEO of Edible Garden, added, \u201cWe believe Narayan Group\u2019s proven success and alignment with our Zero-Waste Inspired \u00ae vision will allow us to build scale, expand internationally, and enhance our operational efficiency. This value acquisition should position us to create meaningful value for our shareholders by meeting the growing demand for sustainable, plant-based food products. Narayan has a demonstrated strength in acquiring and developing products under a vertically integrated supply chain management strategy resulting in strong gross margins throughout Europe. We believe this transaction will provide us with immediate value, allow us to introduce Narayan\u2019s products into the North American market and provide a much stronger base to grow in the future. Our combined strategy will be to build on Narayan\u2019s footprint in Europe with their ability to acquire other successful product offerings and to expand those through our established and growing North American channels.\u201d Story Continues The Proposed Transaction Under the terms of the LOI, in consideration for 100% of the share capital of Narayan d.o.o. (the parent of the Narayan Group companies), Edible Garden will issue to the Narayan shareholders shares of Edible Garden common stock. Subject to completion of the respective parties\u2019 due diligence investigation and receipt by Edible Garden of an opinion from an independent investment banker that the terms of the transaction are fair to the Edible Garden stockholders from a financial point of view, it is anticipated that a majority of the fully-diluted outstanding shares of Edible Garden common stock at closing will be issued to the Narayan shareholders. The LOI contemplates that, subject to Nasdaq requirements, a majority of the members of the Edible Garden board of directors shall be designated by the Narayan shareholders or their affiliate. Jim Kras will continue to serve as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Edible and Mario Brumat, the current president of Narayan will continue to head European operations and serve as a member of the Edible Garden board of directors. Closing of the transaction is expected to be subject to a number of closing conditions, including a satisfactory due diligence investigation by both parties, completion of a \u20ac6.0 million equity financing for Narayan, consummation of a contemplated reverse stock split of the current outstanding shares of common stock of Edible Garden, execution of employment agreements for Messrs. Kras and Brumat, establishment of a 2025 Equity Incentive Plan for Edible and approval of the transaction by the Edible Garden stockholders.

pulses supplier The Narayan Group A bowl of quinoa \u00b7 Just Food \u00b7 Max Griss / Unsplash Dean Best Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 5:19 PM 2 min read In This Article: EDBLW +5.56% US-listed fresh-produce supplier Edible Garden is looking to buy The Narayan Group, a European supplier of oils and pulses. Edible Garden said it had signed a non-binding letter of intent to \u201cpurchase the outstanding share capital\u201d of Narayan. Slovenia-based Narayan supplies organic coconut products and a range of spices, pulses and grains. It sells into major European retailers including Aldi and Lidl. Edible Garden, which is listed on the Nasdaq, specialises in controlled environment agriculture and sells into stores in the US, Caribbean and South America. The company operates vertically-integrated greenhouses and processing facilities in New Jersey and Michigan. It also markets condiments and pickles. Jim Kras, Edible Garden\u2019s CEO, said: \u201cThis value acquisition should position us to create meaningful value for our shareholders by meeting the growing demand for sustainable, plant-based food products. We believe this transaction will provide us with immediate value, allow us to introduce Narayan\u2019s products into the North American market and provide a much stronger base to grow in the future. \"Our combined strategy will be to build on Narayan\u2019s footprint in Europe with their ability to acquire other successful product offerings and to expand those through our established and growing North American channels.\u201d Under the terms of the proposed deal, Edible Garden will issue shares in its business to Narayan\u2019s investors. Subject to the completion of due diligence by both companies, the businesses expect a majority of the fully-diluted outstanding shares of Edible Garden common stock at closing will be issued to the Narayan shareholders. The letter of intent also sets out that, subject to Nasdaq requirements, a majority of the members of the Edible Garden board of directors shall be designated by the Narayan shareholders or their affiliate. Kras will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Edible Garden. Mario Brumat, Narayan\u2019s president, will head the combined group\u2019s European operations and become a member of the Edible Garden board of directors. Brumat said: \u201cWe believe this strategic transaction with Edible Garden represents a transformative opportunity to combine Narayan\u2019s high-growth business model and strong European market leadership with Edible Garden\u2019s innovative CEA technology and established distribution channels in North America. \"Together, we expect to be able to accelerate market expansion, particularly in the US and Canada, by delivering products that meet rising consumer demand for organic and sustainable food products.\u201d Story Continues \"Edible Garden eyes deal with oils and pulses supplier The Narayan Group\" was originally created and published by Just Food , a GlobalData owned brand.
