[{"text": "Analyst on Hyped Apple (AAPL) AI Supercycle: \u2018We Have Seen Nothing\u2019 Yet Fahad Saleem Tue, Jan 28, 2025, 1:46 AM 5 min read In This Article: AAPL We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks Everyone is Talking About These Days . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks everyone is talking about these days. President Donald Trump\u2019s $500 billion investment plan to build AI infrastructure, Stargate, is making waves as analysts believe the project provides a new growth catalyst for major tech companies. Sasha Ostojic, Playground Global venture partner, said in a latest program on CNBC that the plan is just the beginning of AI \u201crenaissance\u201d in the country: \u201cStargate is just the beginning, I think, of this renaissance of AI technology in this country, even though it seems like we\u2019ve been in it for a few years. And, you know, it reminds me of the Apollo program from the 50s and 60s. In that case, it was a government-run program that created a bunch of technology, propelled the world forward, created a bunch of companies, and set us up for a lot of prosperity in the decades to follow.\u201d Ostojic also talked about the Jensen Huang-led company and said its stock has been going \u201csideways\u201d and the market is waiting for the next big \u201ctrigger.\u201d He is bullish on the company and thinks the $500 billion plan with the company at its center could be the next growth catalyst investors were waiting for.

Analyst on Hyped Apple (AAPL) AI Supercycle: \u2018We Have Seen Nothing\u2019 Yet A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 158 Daniel Newman from The Futurum Group was recently asked on Schwab Network his thoughts on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). The analyst explained why he was skeptical about the stock. \u201cI\u2019m still skeptical about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) because of where the valuation sits. I mean, this is one of the most consequential companies in the world. It has a massive install base, but I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite gotten its AI rollout correct. That could be artificial intelligence or app intelligence. The early readouts are low use and not super great value. Story Continues Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is desperately in need of new catalysts. The company\u2019s revenue in China fell 8% in fiscal year 2024, following a 2% decline the previous year. The Chinese market accounts for about 15% of Apple\u2019s total revenue, so this downtrend cannot be ignored. Investors had hopes from the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, but so far its performance has been weak. Vision Pro faces tough competition from Meta\u2019s $500 Quest and the more affordable Quest 3S, making it hard to justify its $3,500 price tag. The failure of Apple\u2019s HomePod, unable to compete with Amazon\u2019s and Google\u2019s lower-priced offerings, further highlights the challenges in this market. Apple\u2019s iPhone 16 has not shown promising growth prospects yet and investors are still in a wait-and-see mode on the AI platform. CDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter : \u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing. Overall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of AI stocks everyone is talking about these days. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock .

Nonperforming assets totaled $15.6 million , or 0.45% of total assets, at December 31, 2024 , down $2.7 million , or 15%, from September 30, 2024 , primarily due to improved performance of certain loans, including nonperforming loans, and paydowns.

The flat loan yield was impacted by a few factors for the fourth quarter of 2024. 39% of the loan portfolio is adjustable therefore the yield began declining in mid-September 2024 as the Federal Reserve cut rates. The net loan yield was higher by approximately 3 bps, or $189,000 , for the quarter due to a nonperforming relationship paying off during the quarter which was offset slightly from loans transferring to nonperforming. In addition, yields on loans were impacted by higher rates on new loans and\u00a0loans paying off at lower rates. We experienced growth in construction and land, commercial real estate and multi-family loans for the current quarter across most of our markets. Credit Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses Nonperforming assets (\"NPAs\"), totaled $15.6 million , or 0.45% of total assets at December\u00a031, 2024, down $2.7 million , or 15%, from $18.4 million , or 0.53% of total assets, at September\u00a030, 2024. The Company recorded net loan charge-offs of $235,000 during the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to net loan charge-offs of $74,000 for the third quarter of 2024. The Company made a $873,000 provision to the allowance for loan losses in the fourth quarter of 2024 primarily due to loan growth. For the year ended December\u00a031, 2024, provisions to the allowance for loan losses totaled $2.4 million . At December\u00a031, 2024, the allowance for loan losses totaled $32.9 million , or 1.21% of total loans, compared to $32.3 million , or 1.21% of total loans, at September\u00a030, 2024. Changes in expected losses reflect various factors including the changing economic activity, potential mitigating effects of governmental stimulus, customer specific information impacting changes in risk ratings, projected delinquencies and the impact of industry-wide loan modification efforts, among other factors.

Public funds in excess of the FDIC insurance limits are fully collateralized. Net Interest Income The net interest margin (\"NIM\") increased 11 basis points from 3.71% for the third quarter of 2024 to 3.82% for the fourth quarter of 2024 primarily due to a decline in the funding cost for average interest-bearing liabilities while the yield on average interest-earning assets remained unchanged. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased by 12 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2024. The decrease in deposit costs primarily reflects the decline in certificate of deposit rates as they matured. Average other interest-earning assets were $97.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, up $17.8 million , or 22%, from the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to an increase in the average balance of cash and cash equivalents. Loan accretion income from acquired loans totaled $421,000 for the fourth quarter of 2024, down $31,000 , or 7%, compared to the third quarter of 2024. Average other borrowings were $107.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, down $32.8 million , 23%, from the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to the payoff of the BTFP loan, which was replaced with short-term FHLB advances. The average rate paid on total interest-bearing deposits was 2.66% for the fourth quarter of 2024, down 12 basis points from the third quarter of 2024, due to the lower funding cost. The average rate paid on certificate of deposits was 4.33% for the fourth quarter of 2024, down 26 basis points from the third quarter of 2024.

The decrease was related primarily to decreases in gains on sale of loans (down $133,000 ) and bank card fees (down $27,000 ), which were partially offset by increases in gains on sale of assets, net (up $49,000 ) and service fees and charges (up $43,000 ) for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2024. Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2024 totaled $22.4 million , up $97,000 , or less than 1%, compared to the third quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily due to increases in marketing and advertising (up $285,000 ),\u00a0 compensation and benefits (up $256,000 ) and provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments (up $240,000 ), which were partially offset by decreases in occupancy expense (down $390,000 ), data processing and communications (down $120,000 ), other noninterest expense (down $120,000 ), franchise and shares taxes (down $88,000 ) and professional services (down $34,000 ). Capital and Liquidity At December\u00a031, 2024, shareholders' equity totaled $396.1 million , up $2.6 million , or 1%, compared to $393.5 million at September\u00a030, 2024. The increase was primarily due to the Company's earnings of $9.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2024, which were partially offset by an increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss on available for sale investment securities and shareholder's dividends and repurchases of shares of the Company's common stock. The market value of the Company's available for sale securities at December\u00a031, 2024 decreased $8.8 million , or 27%, during the fourth quarter of 2024.

Don\u2019t Think AI is a Story Yet\u2019 Fahad Saleem Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 10:01 PM 5 min read In This Article: AAPL We recently published a list of Top 10 AI News You Shouldn\u2019t Miss . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other top AI news you shouldn\u2019t miss. All everyone could talk about in the technical AI landscape these days is DeepSeek-R1, a Chinese open-source LLM that analysts believe can give major American AI companies a run for their money. Why is DeepSeek making waves and why is it called a breakthrough in the AI race? DeepSeek AI model is several times cheaper to use for professional purposes when compared to its American counterparts including OpenAI\u2019s o1 model. Media reports also suggest the model beat almost all key AI models in the industry by significant margins. CNBC\u2019s Deirdre Bosa explained what makes these Chinese models a challenge for US tech companies: \u201cThe cost, I mean, these models coming out of China are just built at a fraction of the price when you think about OpenAI. That\u2019s spending $5 billion a year, burning through billions of dollars a year. These models, the DeepSeek for example, they say they built it for less than $6 million. ByteDance as well, you know, shows that it was built and you can access it at much, much lower prices. So, this really turns on sort of this truth that we have thought about generative AI for the last few years\u2014that you need hundreds of millions of dollars to develop bigger and better models. What the Chinese labs and companies are doing is they\u2019re going straight to the frontier. They\u2019re building with sort of infrastructure and outputs that are already out there, built in many cases by American companies and startups, and they\u2019re improving on it, they\u2019re innovating on it, and producing models that are just as good, in some cases, at a fraction of the cost.\u201d READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks currently in the news. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ( see more details here ). Analyst on Apple (AAPL): \u2018I Don\u2019t Think AI is a Story Yet\u2019 guteksk7/Shutterstock.com Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 158 Bonawyn Eison, Chief Investment Officer and Managing Partner, Wynsource Partners, recently said on CNBC that he does not believe AI would be a strong enough driver for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to take the company to the next level. Story Continues \u201cI just don\u2019t understand what the real drivers of the super cycle are, and if AI is the catalyst behind it, I can understand that. They don\u2019t have the same cashback spend as some of the other MAGs, so there\u2019s a floor there. But in terms of what\u2019s going to take what is already a fully valued company to the next level and lead to, either for me, P/E expansion, I don\u2019t think AI is a story yet, or I don\u2019t see it.\u201d Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is desperately in need of new catalysts. The company\u2019s revenue in China fell 8% in fiscal year 2024, following a 2% decline the previous year. The Chinese market accounts for about 15% of Apple\u2019s total revenue, so this downtrend cannot be ignored. Investors had hopes from the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, but so far its performance has been weak. Vision Pro faces tough competition from Meta\u2019s $500 Quest and the more affordable Quest 3S, making it hard to justify its $3,500 price tag. The failure of Apple\u2019s HomePod, unable to compete with Amazon\u2019s and Google\u2019s lower-priced offerings, further highlights the challenges in this market. Apple\u2019s iPhone 16 has not shown promising growth prospects yet and investors are still in a wait-and-see mode on the AI platform. CDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter : \u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing. Overall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of top AI news you shouldn\u2019t miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock .

Announces Reverse Stock Split Conduit Pharmaceuticals Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 4:00 PM 5 min read In This Article: CDT CDTTW NAPLES, Fla. and CAMBRIDGE, United Kingdom, Jan. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Conduit Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: CDT) (\u201cConduit\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a multi-asset, clinical stage, disease-agnostic life science company delivering an efficient model for compound development, announces that its board of directors has approved a 1-for-100 reverse stock split of the Company\u2019s common stock. The Company\u2019s stockholders approved the reverse stock split proposal at the Company\u2019s Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on December 18, 2024. They granted the board of directors the authority to determine the exact split ratio and when to proceed with the reverse stock split. The reverse stock split will become effective on January 24, 2025 at 5:00 pm, Eastern Time (the \u201cEffective Time\u201d), and the Company\u2019s common stock is expected to begin trading on a reverse stock split-adjusted basis on The Nasdaq Global Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) on January 27, 2025 at market open under the existing ticker symbol, \u201cCDT.\u201d The reverse stock split is intended to increase the price per share of the Company\u2019s common stock to allow the Company to demonstrate compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq, among other benefits. As of the Effective Time, every 100 shares of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding common stock will be combined into one share of common stock. The par value per share of the Company\u2019s common stock will remain unchanged at $0.0001. Proportional adjustments will be made to the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Company\u2019s equity awards, convertible securities and warrants, as well as the applicable exercise price, and the number of shares authorized and reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company\u2019s equity incentive plans. The Company\u2019s common stock will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol \u201cCDT\u201d following the reverse stock split, with a new CUSIP number of 20678X205. After the effectiveness of the reverse stock split, the number of outstanding shares of common stock will be reduced to approximately 1.5 million. No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the reverse stock split, and stockholders who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share will receive a proportional cash payment. The Company\u2019s transfer agent, VStock Transfer, LLC, will serve as the exchange agent for the reverse stock split. Registered stockholders holding pre-reverse stock split shares of common stock electronically in book-entry form are not required to take any action to receive post-reverse stock split shares. Those stockholders who hold their shares in brokerage accounts or in \u201cstreet name\u201d will have their positions automatically adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split, subject to each broker\u2019s particular processes, and will not be required to take any action in connection with the reverse stock split. Story Continues Additional information about the reverse stock split can be found in the Company\u2019s definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 28, 2024, a copy of which is available at www.sec.gov . About Conduit Pharmaceuticals Conduit is a multi-asset, clinical stage, disease-agnostic life science company delivering an efficient model for compound development.

These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, but not limited to: the effect that the reverse stock split may have on the price of the Company\u2019s common stock; the ability or inability to maintain the listing of Conduit\u2019s securities on Nasdaq; the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the business combination completed in September 2023, which may be affected by, among other things, competition; the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth economically and hire and retain key employees; the risks that Conduit\u2019s product candidates in development fail clinical trials or are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or other applicable authorities on a timely basis or at all; changes in applicable laws or regulations; the possibility that Conduit may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and other risks as identified in filings made by Conduit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Moreover, Conduit operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and some of which are beyond Conduit\u2019s control, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and except as required by law, Conduit assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

Character AI claims it is protected by the First Amendment Kyle Wiggers Sat, Jan 25, 2025, 7:25 PM 4 min read Character AI, a platform that lets users engage in roleplay with AI chatbots, has filed a motion to dismiss a case brought against it by the parent of a teen who committed suicide after allegedly becoming hooked on the company's technology. In October, Megan Garcia filed a lawsuit against Character AI in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division, over the death of her son, Sewell Setzer III. According to Garcia, her 14-year-old developed an emotional attachment to a chatbot on Character AI, \"Dany,\" which he texted constantly \u2014 to the point where he began to pull away from the real world. Following Setzer's death, Character AI said it would roll out a number of new safety features, including improved detection, response, and intervention related to chats that violate its terms of service. But Garcia is fighting for additional guardrails, including changes that might result in chatbots on Character AI losing their ability to tell stories and personal anecdotes. In the motion to dismiss, counsel for Character AI asserts the platform is protected against liability by the First Amendment, just as computer code is . The motion may not persuade a judge, and Character AI's legal justifications may change as the case proceeds. But the motion possibly hints at early elements of Character AI's defense. \"The First Amendment prohibits tort liability against media and technology companies arising from allegedly harmful speech, including speech allegedly resulting in suicide,\" the filing reads. \"The only difference between this case and those that have come before is that some of the speech here involves AI. But the context of the expressive speech \u2014 whether a conversation with an AI chatbot or an interaction with a video game character \u2014 does not change the First Amendment analysis.\" To be clear, Character AI's counsel isn't asserting the company's First Amendment rights. Rather, the motion argues that Character AI's users would have their First Amendment rights violated should the lawsuit against the platform succeed. The motion doesn't address whether Character AI might be held harmless under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the federal safe-harbor law that protects social media and other online platforms from liability for third-party content. The law's authors have implied that Section 230 doesn't protect output from AI like Character AI's chatbots, but it's far from a settled legal matter . Story Continues Counsel for Character AI also claims that Garcia's real intention is to \"shut down\" Character AI and prompt legislation regulating technologies like it. Should the plaintiffs be successful, it would have a \"chilling effect\" on both Character AI and the entire nascent generative AI industry, counsel for the platform says. \"Apart from counsel\u2019s stated intention to 'shut down' Character AI, [their complaint] seeks drastic changes that would materially limit the nature and volume of speech on the platform,\" the filing reads. \"These changes would radically restrict the ability of Character AI's millions of users to generate and participate in conversations with characters.\" The lawsuit, which also names Character AI corporate benefactor Alphabet as a defendant, is but one of several lawsuits that Character AI is facing relating to how minors interact with the AI-generated content on its platform. Other suits allege that Character AI exposed a 9-year-old to \"hypersexualized content\" and promoted self-harm to a 17-year-old user . In December, Texas Attorney General\u00a0Ken Paxton announced he was launching an investigation into\u00a0Character AI\u00a0and 14 other tech firms over alleged violations of the state\u2019s online privacy and safety laws for children. \"These investigations are a critical step toward ensuring that social media and AI companies comply with our laws designed to protect children from exploitation and harm,\" said Paxton in a press release. Character AI is part of a booming industry of AI companionship apps \u2014 the mental health effects of which are largely unstudied. Some experts have expressed concerns that these apps could exacerbate feelings of loneliness and anxiety. Character AI, which was founded in 2021 by Google AI researcher Noam Shazeer, and which Google reportedly paid $2.7 billion to \" reverse acquihire ,\" has claimed that it continues to take steps to improve safety and moderation. In December, the company rolled out new safety tools, a separate AI model for teens, blocks on sensitive content, and more prominent disclaimers notifying users that its AI characters are not real people. Character AI has gone through a number of personnel changes after\u00a0Shazeer and the company's other co-founder, Daniel De Freitas, left for Google . The platform hired a former YouTube exec , Erin Teague, as chief product officer, and named Dominic Perella, who was Character AI's general counsel, interim CEO. Character AI recently began testing games on the web in an effort to boost user engagement and retention. TechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!
