PORTFOLIO DIAGNOSTICS Average Market Cap 1 $2538.9M Weighted Average P/E 2 22.8x Weighted Average P/B 2 2.9x Net Assets $81.8M Net Leverage 1.9\u00a0% 1 Geometric Average : This weighted calculation uses each portfolio holding's market cap in a way designed to not skew the effect of very large or small holdings; instead, it aims to better identify the portfolio's center, which Royce believes offers a more accurate measure of average market cap than a simple mean or median. 2 Harmonic Average : This weighted calculation evaluates a portfolio as if it were a single stock and measures it overall. It compares the total market value of the portfolio to the portfolio's share in the earnings of its underlying stocks. The Price-Earnings , or P/E, ratio is calculated by dividing a company's share price by its trailing 12-month earnings-per-share (EPS). The Fund's P/E ratio calculation excludes companies with zero or negative earnings (16% of portfolio holdings as of 12/31/24). The Price-to-Book, or P/B, Ratio is calculated by dividing a company's share price by its book value per share. Story Continues The Price-to-Book , or P/B, Ratio is calculated by dividing a company's share price by its book value per share. Net leverage is the percentage, in excess of 100 %, of the total value of equity type investments, divided by net assets.

The stock is up 7.5% since reporting and currently trades at $80.21. Read our full, actionable report on Fortive here, it\u2019s free. Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our 9 Best Market-Beating Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

One Stock to Buy Instead Over the past six months, ESAB has been a great trade, beating the S&P 500 by 21.7%. Its stock price has climbed to $117.62, representing a healthy 27.8% increase. This was partly due to its solid quarterly results, and the run-up might have investors contemplating their next move. Is there a buying opportunity in ESAB, or does it present a risk to your portfolio? Get the full breakdown from our expert analysts, it\u2019s free . Despite the momentum, we're sitting this one out for now. Here are three reasons why ESAB doesn't excite us and a stock we'd rather own. Why Is ESAB Not Exciting? Having played a significant role in the construction of the iconic Sydney Opera House, ESAB (NYSE:ESAB) manufactures and sells welding and cutting equipment for numerous industries. 1. Long-Term Revenue Growth Disappoints A company\u2019s long-term sales performance signals its overall quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last three years, ESAB grew its sales at a tepid 4.7% compounded annual growth rate. This was below our standard for the industrials sector. ESAB Quarterly Revenue 2. Slow Organic Growth Suggests Waning Demand In Core Business In addition to reported revenue, organic revenue is a useful data point for analyzing Professional Tools and Equipment companies. This metric gives visibility into ESAB\u2019s core business because it excludes one-time events such as mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures along with foreign currency fluctuations - non-fundamental factors that can manipulate the income statement. Over the last two years, ESAB\u2019s organic revenue averaged 4.8% year-on-year growth. This performance was underwhelming and suggests it may need to improve its products, pricing, or go-to-market strategy, which can add an extra layer of complexity to its operations. ESAB Organic Revenue Growth 3. EPS Barely Growing We track the change in earnings per share (EPS) because it highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable. ESAB\u2019s weak 3.9% annual EPS growth over the last three years aligns with its revenue performance. On the bright side, this tells us its incremental sales were profitable. ESAB Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) Final Judgment ESAB isn\u2019t a terrible business, but it isn\u2019t one of our picks. With its shares outperforming the market lately, the stock trades at 22.4\u00d7 forward price-to-earnings (or $117.62 per share). This valuation tells us a lot of optimism is priced in - we think there are better investment opportunities out there. Let us point you toward MercadoLibre, the Amazon and PayPal of Latin America . Stocks We Like More Than ESAB With rates dropping, inflation stabilizing, and the elections in the rearview mirror, all signs point to the start of a new bull run - and we\u2019re laser-focused on finding the best stocks for this upcoming cycle.

Should You Buy the Dip in Esab (ESAB) Zacks Equity Research Mon, Jan 6, 2025, 5:35 PM 2 min read Esab (ESAB) has been beaten down lately with too much selling pressure. While the stock has lost 8.2% over the past four weeks, there is light at the end of the tunnel as it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts expect the company to report better earnings than they predicted earlier. Guide to Identifying Oversold Stocks We use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30. Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal. So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound. However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision. Here's Why ESAB Could Experience a Turnaround The heavy selling of ESAB shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 28.06. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand. 3-month RSI Chart for ESAB The RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term. On the fundamental side, there has been strong agreement among the sell-side analysts covering the stock in raising earnings estimates for the current year. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for ESAB has increased 0.5%. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term. Moreover, ESAB currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.
