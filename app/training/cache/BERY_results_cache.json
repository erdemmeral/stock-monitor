[{"text": "FIBC Market Size to Hit USD 12.86 Billion by 2033 | Straits Research Straits Research Private Limited - Garner Insights Tue, Jan 28, 2025, 2:30 AM 8 min read Straits Research Private Limited - Garner Insights The global fibc market size was valued at USD 8.36 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach from USD 8.77 billion in 2025 to USD 12.86 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 4.9% during the forecast period (2025-2033). New York, United States, Jan. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FIBCs are also referred to as bulk bags, jumbo bags, and large bags. These comprise flexible woven material, commonly polypropylene (PP), and can support 500 kg to 2,000 kg. Woven PP Fabric is used to create FIBCs (Flexible Intermediate Bulk Containers), also known as Big Bag, Jumbo bags, Bulk bags, Super Sacks bags, Tote bags, etc. Manufacturers provide lightweight containers, so the FIBC Market is expected to expand consistently. In addition, the expansion of the food and pharmaceutical industries and the growing need to reduce the total weight of bulk packaging are one of the most critical drivers driving the need for FIBC. It is anticipated that industries will use FIBCs to carry grains, rice, and biological product-related liquid chemicals.

In addition, an increase in international imports and exports, which necessitate higher packaging requirements on the international market, is anticipated to propel market expansion throughout the forecast period. FIBC provides improved product protection and is frequently used as export and import packaging. Moreover, FIBC packaging is growing in popularity as export and import packaging material due to its lightweight and adaptability, consequently driving the expansion of the global market. Rise in E-Commerce Retailing to Provide Opportunities for the Global FIBC Market Significant growth in the e-commerce platform has increased supply chain demand for high-quality packaging. By 2022, it is anticipated that the e-commerce retailing industry will account for over 12 percent of total retail in Western Europe and over 19 percent of total retail in the United States. By 2022, the retail industry in China is anticipated to account for 29% of total revenue. Together, these characteristics are anticipated to provide future growth opportunities for e-commerce merchants. In addition, demographic shifts and an increase in the penetration of broadband and other internet services in China and other Asian nations, along with the development of delivery infrastructure, are anticipated to contribute remarkably to the revenue growth of the e-commerce industry in the near future. Story Continues By minimizing the overall cost of goods delivery, e-commerce companies strive to increase their revenue share. Consequently, these stakeholders choose viable alternatives to conventional packaging materials and position themselves as participants in environmental sustainability projects. Currently, e-commerce websites and online retail enterprises demand fifty percent more FIBC packaging than traditional retail channels. This is due to the growing demand for product security during transit and single-item shipping. In addition, many businesses have preferred using lower-weight packaging materials to lower the overall cost of transporting items. Consequently, the increase in demand for more lightweight and eco-friendly packaging materials is predicted to expand the total FIBC market's revenue potential throughout the forecast period. Regional Analysis By region, the global FIBC market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Asia Pacific accounted for the largest market share and is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 5.9% during the forecast period. Increasing e-commerce business investments are anticipated to drive demand for FIBC. Changing consumer preferences toward reusable packaging due to a greater awareness of environmental protection and waste reduction are anticipated to enhance FIBC demand. India is one of the world's biggest automakers and has a substantial presence in the car ancillary business. Population increase and rising consumer reliance on packaged and ready-to-eat foods are anticipated to benefit the rise of FIBC demand. Moreover, India is emerging as a center for pharmaceutical and healthcare products due to strong public and private expenditures in the manufacturing sector, which boosts manufacturing activity in the country, hence supporting the FIBC market. The automotive industry has made a substantial contribution to South Korea's economy. In 2019, the nation produced approximately 3.95 million autos with an export value of $40.5 billion. The growth of the FIBC market in the country is expected to be fueled by investments targeted at bolstering domestically significant industries. Europe is the second largest region. It is estimated to reach an expected value of USD 1700 million by 2030 at a CAGR of 4.8%. The governments have mainly emphasized FDI investments throughout the area to entice American companies. The country's FDI cash flows decreased by 39% in 2020 due to the COVID-19 epidemic. Therefore, the country has temporarily decreased the review threshold for non-EU/EEA investments from 25% or higher to 10% for a handful of publicly traded enterprises. This is anticipated to attract more foreign direct investment in all areas of the economy, which will, in turn, enhance the FIBC market. For R&D spending, the British government has consistently prioritized collaborations between universities and small and major pharmaceutical companies. This is anticipated to assist the country's pharmaceutical industry, which will, in turn, benefit the FIBC market. After BREXIT, the British government has been eager to establish free-trade agreements with the United States, China, and other Asian nations. The government has been planning new trade agreements to bolster the digital and electronics industries' trade, particularly with the United States and Australia. Government efforts to increase commerce in the country are anticipated to generate new opportunities for FIBC members in the region. North America is the third largest region. In North America, e-commerce penetration has expanded significantly over the past few years due to increased internet access and numerous e-commerce-based services. In 2020, more than 76% of the North American population purchased things through online services; by 2024, that percentage is expected to surpass 87%. Significant-scale logistics and supply chain operations are required for online product distribution, and many FIBCs are utilized to assist product distribution. This is anticipated to boost the FIBC market as a whole. Since 2014, the adoption of third-party logistics services in the region has increased dramatically due to the numerous tangible benefits to manufacturers, such as the scalability and flexibility of the services in terms of labor, space, and time, as well as the maximum network capacity allowing for flexible distribution. Although the e-commerce sector is in its infancy, it is anticipated to grow at a robust CAGR throughout the projection period. This expansion of e-commerce is likely to increase the number of B2B companies in the country, which will, in turn, increase the need for FIBC.

Turnaround of U.S. Steel \u2013 Not Trying to Solicit Alternative Bids and Sell the Company CLEVELAND, January 27, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Ancora Holdings Group, LLC (collectively with its affiliates, \"Ancora\" or \"we\"), a diversified investment firm that oversees approximately $10 billion in assets, today issued the below open letter to the Board of Directors (the \"Board\") of United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) (\"U.S. Steel\" or the \"Company\") regarding a variety of issues, including the Company\u2019s recently blocked sale to Nippon Steel Corporation (\"Nippon\"). To receive important updates, visit www.MakeUSSteelGreatAgain.com . *** January 27, 2025 United States Steel Corporation 600 Grant Street Pittsburgh, PA 15219 Attn: The Board Dear Members of the Board, Ancora is a growing shareholder of U.S. Steel. As an investment firm with deep roots in the Midwest, we have an affinity for the industrial and logistics companies that collectively form the backbone of America\u2019s economy. We are proud to be investors in companies such as Berry Global Group, Inc., Norfolk Southern Corporation, RB Global, Inc. and now U.S. Steel. Owning these types of businesses enables us to pursue strong risk-adjusted returns while helping support American competitiveness, job creation and wage growth. Although we understand why the Board explored strategic alternatives in 2023, its ultimate decision to ignore national security and pursue a risky sale to Nippon \u2013 an overseas bidder that came in just $1 per share higher than a competing domestic bidder \u2013 has led to a dead end. There appears to be no legal basis and no precedent for U.S. Steel\u2019s costly litigation over the Presidential Executive Order blocking the transaction. Moreover, President Donald Trump is a vocal opponent of the deal and long-term proponent of strengthening America\u2019s domestic manufacturing base. He also has long-held skepticism about foreign direct investment from Japan based on his own business dealings dating back to the 1980s. We see no reason to believe that President Trump, a high-conviction businessman who was elected by middle-class and working-class voters, is going to contradict his self-described \"America First\" agenda and disregard the opposition of the United Steelworkers. Story Continues The Board\u2019s choice to double down on its extremely poor decision to pursue a sale to Nippon has also kept U.S. Steel in a corroded state. Chief Executive Officer David Burritt, who stood to rake in more than $70 million himself if the sale had been consummated, has been allowed to misallocate capital, issue unreliable and overoptimistic forecasts, and repeatedly miss financial targets. It seems the Board failed to keep Mr. Burritt\u2019s attention on efficiency, execution and risk management as steel prices remained depressed over the past year. Rather than finally acknowledge the Company\u2019s perilous trajectory and try to course correct, the Board remains steadfastly committed to an underperforming leader who apparently lacks the ability and vision to bring U.S. Steel back from a busted transaction. In light of these alarming decisions and the unjustifiable deference to Mr. Burritt, who has made clear through outlandish rhetoric that he is self-interested and unfit for leadership, Ancora has nominated nine highly qualified, independent candidates for election to the Board at U.S. Steel\u2019s 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Our slate includes individuals with corporate governance experience, finance expertise, industrials and manufacturing backgrounds, public policy acumen and other qualifications critical to turning around a standalone U.S. Steel. The slate\u2019s plan includes installing Alan Kestenbaum, a steel industry legend who delivered total shareholder returns of more than 450% at Stelco Holdings Inc., as a replacement for Mr. Burritt. We expect the investment community will agree that any steel company would be fortunate to have Mr. Kestenbaum assume such a role. Our slate and Mr. Kestenbaum look forward to ultimately releasing their full plan for enhancing U.S. Steel\u2019s corporate governance, cost structure, labor relations, margins, operations and long-term viability as a force within the American economy. With the tailwind of President Trump\u2019s agenda, including steel tariffs, our nominees are confident they will shift the Company\u2019s strategy from hoping to be saved to implementing a multi-year plan that targets meaningful share price appreciation. The Case for Wholesale Change: The Board Has Doubled Down on its Bad Decision to Pursue a Risky Sale \u2013 Even After the Sale was Blocked by Executive Order We want to take this opportunity to share a few key facts. First and foremost, no transaction blocked by Presidential Executive Order after a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has ever gone through. This means there is no legal precedent for the litigation brought by U.S. Steel and Nippon earlier this month. Although U.S. Steel seems to be holding out hope that it can convince President Trump to approve the deal, the facts indicate that this is a pipe dream. President Trump has repeatedly voiced opposition to the transaction and has long been skeptical of deals with Japanese businesses. 1 In fact, just last month he stated \"I am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company, in this case Nippon Steel of Japan [\u2026] As President, I will block this deal from happening.\" 2 Nothing he has said since former President Joseph Biden\u2019s Executive Order indicates a change of heart. In addition to the aforementioned headwinds, the blocked deal also faced opposition from Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a bipartisan contingent of high-profile lawmakers and the United Steelworkers. When they were in the Senate, Messrs. Vance and Rubio previously co-authored a letter to then-Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen to stress that \"[t]he transaction was not entered into with U.S. national security in mind.\" 3 It should be clear as day that U.S. Steel is now fighting a binding Executive Order, the Trump administration, an array of senators and representatives, and a multitude of third parties that do not buy into Mr. Burritt\u2019s self-serving arguments. The Board should also be aware of what independent and objective legal experts have to say: \"Unfortunately for Nippon Steel, their argument is not particularly strong. The president's action in this case is explicitly excluded from judicial review under U.S. law.\" - Akira Inoue, partner, Baker & McKenzie 4 \"The D.C. Circuit is unlikely to overturn the blocking order based solely on allegations of pre-determination or the appearance of a sham process. Substantial evidence of constitutional violations or procedural defects is normally required. In addition, there does not appear to be a process for taking evidence, so the sham argument cannot be developed beyond what is in the public record.\" - Ken Nunnenkamp, partner, Morgan Lewis 5 \"Nippon and U.S. Steel face a formidable uphill battle in challenging CFIUS' referral and the president's exercise of authority to block the deal on national security grounds. Congress intended to shield CFIUS' decisions, and the president's conclusions under the CFIUS regime, from virtually all judicial review, an approach that is consistent with broad judicial deference to the executive branch on national security matters.\" - Mario Mancuso, George W. Hicks Jr. and Lucille Hague, partners, Kirkland & Ellis 6 It borders on delusional to think that the Trump administration would use precious political capital at the start of its term to reverse its public position on the transaction, not to mention undermine its clearly articulated focus on revitalizing American manufacturing and insourcing. The Case for Wholesale Change: The Board Has Allowed a Conflicted, Underperforming CEO to Hinder U.S. Steel\u2019s Credibility and Undermine the Company\u2019s Future Ancora has a proven track record of correctly identifying companies that are held back by conflicted or unfit CEOs. Before we seek the removal of a CEO, we typically try to work with a board of directors to address and course correct the executive\u2019s shortcomings. In this case, however, we see no future with Mr. Burritt. In our view, Mr. Burritt exhibited disqualifying behavior on January 3 rd , when he issued a statement that called former President Biden\u2019s decision \"shameful and corrupt . \" He continued what appeared to be a tirade by calling highly respected United Steelworkers President David McCall a \" union boss,\" effectively questioning his integrity. 7 We also need to scrutinize the Board\u2019s oversight of Mr. Burritt in light of his public accusation that the prior administration made a decision that supports the Chinese Communist Party. It runs counter to the interests of shareholders, to which Mr. Burritt owes a fiduciary duty, to make seemingly unhinged and retaliatory statements about plans \"to fight President Biden\u2019s political corruption.\" 8 Regardless of political leanings, this is not how standard public company executives act. Perhaps this is why Jeh Johnson, former Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, abruptly resigned from the Board in recent weeks. Since before the sale to Nippon was announced, Mr. Burritt also appears to have diverted his focus from U.S. Steel\u2019s operations. For example, on the conference call for the Nippon sale announcement, analysts noted that Big River\u2019s EBITDA per ton was down roughly 59% and the mini-mill cost per ton was up roughly 23% following the 2021 Big River acquisition. 9 Mr. Burritt\u2019s response to this was tone deaf: \"we feel absolutely wonderful about this Big River facility. And with Big River 2, it's going to be even more remarkable.\" 10 When U.S. Steel reported fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings only six weeks later, it revealed $12 million of costs related to Big River, which had the effect of reducing the mini-mill segment\u2019s EBITDA to just $74 million. 11 Unfortunately for shareholders, the trend of excess costs at Big River has continued unabated. On September 19, 2024, the Company disclosed that the mini-mill segment\u2019s adjusted EBITDA would be lower than the previous quarter, impacted by $40 million of costs from the Big River 2 mini-mill. 12 The Company followed this with a vague cautionary note on December 19, 2024, stating Big River 2 \"ramp-related costs exert pressure on the quarter.\" 13 In addition to unrelenting Big River cost overruns, U.S. Steel has consistently missed earnings estimates over the past year and a half while lagging its peers. Notably, during Mr. Burritt\u2019s tenure, the Company\u2019s total shareholder returns have underperformed peers by a staggering 227.7%. Total Shareholder Returns* 1-year 5-year Burritt CEO Tenure U.S. Steel -7.7% -21.3% 13.5% Peer Median 24.9% 180.6% 241.2% Relative Performance -32.2% -201.9% -227.7% Source: FactSet and Bloomberg. Peers include Commercial Metals Company, Cleveland-Cliffs Inc., Reliance, Inc., Steel Dynamics, Inc. and Nucor Corporation. *Total shareholder returns as of market close August 11, 2023, the last trading day prior to the Company\u2019s disclosure of initiating a strategic alternatives process. Mr. Burritt\u2019s election by the Board to assume the CEO role was announced May 10, 2017. Key Performance Metrics** Revenue Growth Adjusted EBITDA Growth CapEx Growth Free Cash Flow Growth U.S. Steel 19.7% -25.6% 336.6%*** -225.7% Peer Median 38.3% 15.5% 79.2% 55.0% Relative Performance -18.6% -41.1% 257.4% -280.7% **Key performance metrics measured from figures reported by U.S. Steel and peers from Q2 2021 to Q3 2024. These dates reflect the start of the economic recovery from COVID and the most recently reported quarter. ***CapEx Growth is based on incurred expenses and likely does not yet reflect U.S. Steel's $600 million budget expansion for Big River 2. U.S. Steel is now in a dire state due to its excessive capital spending, high debt, soft earnings and nonexistent contingency plan. While Mr. Burritt may not care due to what seem to be his jet-setting ways, we believe the city of Pittsburgh and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have been put at economic risk by his sale aspirations and mismanagement of the Company. There are consequences associated with having out-of-touch leadership with weak involvement in local communities. Absent a miracle, Ancora believes a substantial and urgent reconstitution of the Company\u2019s leadership is necessary. An Alternative Path Forward: Our Slate and Mr. Kestenbaum Want to Make U.S. Steel Great Again in the Public Market Ancora has nominated a fit-for-purpose slate with nine highly qualified individuals, whose complementary skills make them greater than the sum of their parts. Each is a leader in his or her respective field and is able to draw on prior public company experience to help set a viable go-forward strategy. Our nominees include individuals with experience in corporate governance, executive leadership, finance, logistics, manufacturing, regulatory affairs and strategic transactions. They come to the Board free of the incumbents\u2019 past mistakes, open-minded, and committed to producing enduring value for shareholders and stakeholders. Importantly, the slate includes industry heavyweight Alan Kestenbaum, the former Chairman and CEO of Stelco, as a CEO candidate for U.S. Steel. If our slate\u2019s campaign is successful, Mr. Kestenbaum will bring to the role a uniquely close relationship with the United Steelworkers, expertise in identifying and operating undervalued assets, and an unrelenting commitment to delivering the best possible results. Most notably, Mr. Kestenbaum has a history of turning U.S. Steel\u2019s failed endeavors into home runs. Look no further than what he accomplished at Stelco, a company U.S. Steel put into bankruptcy. Mr. Kestenbaum acquired Stelco for approximately $53 million, only to later sell it for more than $2 billion. 14 In the process, he enriched his shareholders through the success of a turnaround, whereas U.S. Steel\u2019s investors received virtually nothing for the asset. Considering the significant underperformance of U.S. Steel\u2019s operations and Mr. Burritt\u2019s underwhelming results as a leader, Mr. Kestenbaum represents a massive upgrade on all fronts. If elected, our slate and its CEO candidate are committed to the following: Pursuing the $565 million breakup fee that U.S. Steel needs based on Mr. Burritt\u2019s own statements regarding the prospect of potential facility closures and layoffs. Immediately ending the current Board\u2019s spending spree on Wall Street advisors, which we estimate to be a nine-figure sum over the past 18 months. Revamping the executive leadership team to be full of operators residing near facilities and plants. Restoring relations with labor union members and leaders, community organizations and elected officials. Releasing a clear standalone strategy so investors have transparency about priorities for capital allocation, operations and production, and other commercial initiatives. Protecting Mon Valley Works and other facilities Mr. Burritt has threatened to close. It\u2019s important to highlight that Mr. Kestenbaum\u2019s track record as a CEO includes increasing employment everywhere he has been. Not soliciting acquisition proposals from Cleveland-Cliffs, Inc. or any other partner (domestic or foreign). Please note that despite the sale to Nippon being blocked this month, you \u2013 the Board \u2013 decided to keep a January deadline for director candidate nominations in an apparent effort to insulate yourselves. We complied with your deadline despite being in the process of amassing a meaningful stake that will be disclosed in due course. Make no mistake, Ancora, as well as Mr. Kestenbaum, intend to build meaningful positions as sale pipe dreams fade and the Company\u2019s share price continues resetting from what have been artificially inflated levels. In closing, our goal here is straightforward: make U.S. Steel great again for the benefit of employees, customers, shareholders and all other stakeholders who want a bright future for this American icon. Only under a new Board and management team do we believe this is possible. Regards, Fredrick D.

Some of these forward-looking statements can be identified by words like \"anticipate,\" \"approximately,\" \"believe,\" \"continue,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"forecast,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"outlook,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"possible,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"target,\" \"seek,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" or \"would,\" the negative of these words, other terms of similar meaning or the use of future dates. Such statements, including projections as to the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction, the impact of the proposed transaction on Amcor's and Berry's business and future financial and operating results and prospects, the amount and timing of synergies from the proposed transaction, the terms and scope of the expected financing in connection with the proposed transaction, the aggregate amount of indebtedness of the combined company following the closing of the proposed transaction and the closing date for the proposed transaction, are based on the current estimates, assumptions and projections of the management of Amcor and Berry, and are qualified by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations generally. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond Amcor's and Berry's control. None of Amcor, Berry or any of their respective directors, executive officers, or advisors, provide any representation, assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements will actually occur, or if any of them do occur, what impact they will have on the business, results of operations or financial condition of Amcor or Berry. Should any risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have a material adverse effect on Amcor's and Berry's businesses, the proposed transaction and the ability to successfully complete the proposed transaction and realize its expected benefits. Risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ from expectations include, but are not limited to, the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement; the risk that the conditions to the completion of the proposed transaction (including shareholder and regulatory approvals) are not satisfied in a timely manner or at all; the risks arising from the integration of the Amcor and Berry businesses; the risk that the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction may not be realized when expected or at all; the risk of unexpected costs or expenses resulting from the proposed transaction; the risk of litigation related to the proposed transaction; the risks related to disruption of management's time from ongoing business operations as a result of the proposed transaction; the risk that the proposed transaction may have an adverse effect on the ability of Amcor and Berry to retain key personnel and customers; and those risks discussed in Amcor's and Berry's respective filings with the SEC. Forward looking statements included herein are made only as of the date hereof and neither Amcor nor Berry undertakes any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, or any other information in this communication, as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, or to correct any inaccuracies or omissions in them which become apparent. All forward-looking statements in this communication are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Included in this communication are measures of financial performance that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These measures include annual cash flow, adjusted cash earnings per share and certain cost, growth and financial synergies of the combined company post consummation of the transaction. In arriving at these non-GAAP measures, Amcor excludes items that either have a non-recurring impact on the income statement or which, in the judgment of our management, are items that, either as a result of their nature or size, could, were they not singled out, potentially cause investors to extrapolate future performance from an improper base. These non-GAAP measures are presented for illustrative purposes only, contain a variety of adjustments, assumptions and preliminary estimates and are not necessarily indicative of what the combined company's actual results of operations or financial condition would be upon completion of the merger. In the view of Amcor's management, the estimated synergies included in this communication were prepared on a reasonable basis, reflecting the best available estimates and judgments of Amcor's management at the time of preparation and presented as of the time of preparation, to the best of Amcor's management's knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and the expected performance of the combined company. While presented with numerical specificity, the estimated synergies presented herein are subject to estimates and assumptions in many respects, inherently uncertain and, as a result, subject to interpretation. The estimates and assumptions used to prepare these estimated synergies may prove not to be appropriate for any number of reasons, including general economic conditions, trends in the packaging industry, including trends in capital spending, inventory and unit production, competition and the risks discussed under the sections entitled \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and \"Risk Factors\" in the Joint Proxy Statement. Such estimated synergies do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date such information was prepared and also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, are not reported by all of Amcor's or Berry's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of Amcor's competitors given potential differences in the exact method of calculation.
