Zacks Equity Research Tue, Jan 28, 2025, 2:20 PM 3 min read In This Article: MORN -0.53% The iShares Morningstar Mid-Cap ETF (IMCB) was launched on 06/28/2004, and is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market. The fund is sponsored by Blackrock. It has amassed assets over $1.06 billion, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market. Why Mid Cap Blend Mid cap companies, with market capitalization in the range of $2 billion and $10 billion, offer investors many things that small and large companies don't, including less risk and higher growth opportunities. These types of companies, then, have a good balance of stability and growth potential. Typically holding a combination of both growth and value stocks, blend ETFs also demonstrate qualities seen in value and growth investments. Costs Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same. Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.04%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space. It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.37%. Sector Exposure and Top Holdings Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis. This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector--about 16.20% of the portfolio. Financials and Information Technology round out the top three. Looking at individual holdings, Applovin Corp Class A (APP) accounts for about 0.64% of total assets, followed by Arthur J Gallagher (AJG) and Capital One Financial Corp (COF). The top 10 holdings account for about 5.78% of total assets under management. Performance and Risk IMCB seeks to match the performance of the MORNINGSTAR US MID CAP INDEX before fees and expenses.

Buffett's $296 Billion Is Invested in These 11 Financial Stocks. Here's the Best of the Bunch for 2025. Keith Speights, The Motley Fool Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 1:52 PM 5 min read In This Article: AXP -0.29% NU -0.76% C -1.56% BAC -0.19% ALLY -2.21% Warren Buffett is a money man -- in multiple ways. The legendary investor ranks among the wealthiest people in the world with a net worth of around $144 billion. While his Berkshire Hathaway operates in a wide range of sectors, it's categorized in the financial services sector because of its huge insurance businesses. You might be surprised at just how important other financial stocks are to Buffett. A little over 39% of his $296 billion Berkshire Hathaway portfolio is invested in 11 financial stocks. Buffett's top 10 financial stocks (plus one) American Express (NYSE: AXP) ranks as Berkshire's second largest holding, making up 16.3% of the conglomerate's portfolio. Berkshire's stake in the financial services company, which is best known for its credit cards, is worth over $48 billion. Another financial stock, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) , is right behind AmEx as Buffett's third largest holding. Berkshire owns nearly $36.8 billion of BofA shares, enough to comprise 12.1% of its portfolio. Two other financial stocks are also among Berkshire's 10 largest positions. Moody's (NYSE: MCO) is No. 7 and makes up 4.1% of the conglomerate's portfolio. Chubb (NYSE: CB) ranks ninth, with Berkshire's roughly $7.2 billion stake reflecting 2.4% of its equity portfolio. Citigroup (NYSE: C) is the sole remaining financial stock that makes up at least 1% of Berkshire's portfolio. Buffett has a position worth around $4.5 billion in the big bank. The credit card duopoly of Visa (NYSE: V) and Mastercard (NYSE: MA) comprise 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively, of Berkshire's total holdings. Capital One Financial (NYSE: COF) isn't far behind at 0.6%. Ally Financial (NYSE: ALLY) and Nu Holdings (NYSE: NU) are tied, with each stock making up 0.4% of Berkshire's portfolio. In addition to those top 10 financial stocks, Buffett and company also have a tiny position in Jefferies Financial Group (NYSE: JEF) worth around $32.6 million. That's chump change for Berkshire and is such a small amount it doesn't even reach 0.1% of the conglomerate's total portfolio. How Buffett's financial stocks stack up against each other Two of Buffett's financial stocks have delivered especially sizzling gains over the past 12 months. Jefferies' shares skyrocketed 88%, while American Express stock soared around 70%. Several others were big winners, though, including Capital One, Citigroup, and Bank of America. Unsurprisingly, Buffett's worst performer in the group, Ally Financial, which rose less than 10% over the past 12 months, has the most attractive valuation. Ally's forward price-to-earnings ratio is a low 8.5. However, some of Buffett's strongest-performing financial stocks are still reasonably valued despite their big gains. For example, Citigroup trades below 11 times forward earnings. Story Continues Ally and Citigroup will also likely appeal the most to income investors. Ally's forward dividend yield tops 3%. Citigroup's forward dividend yield is 2.74%. On the other hand, many of Buffett's financial stocks offer paltry dividend yields of under 1%. Nu Holdings doesn't pay any dividends. Which of these stocks does Wall Street think will jump the most over the next 12 months? Nu is the hands-down winner, with the consensus analysts' price target reflecting an upside potential of nearly 22%. Wall Street also projects that Bank of America, Chubb, Ally, and Jefferies will deliver double-digit percentage gains. The best of the bunch Buffett would almost certainly say that American Express is the best long-term pick of these 11 financial stocks. It's the only member of the group he included in the list of stocks he plans to own \"indefinitely.\" I view several of these stocks, including American Express, as great choices for investors to buy and hold. However, I'm on the same page as Wall Street with my pick as the best of the bunch for 2025: It's Nu. Nu's revenue and earnings continue to grow rapidly. The Latin American digital bank leader dominates the market in its home country of Brazil. It also has tremendous growth prospects in Mexico and Colombia. Income investors will turn up their noses at Nu, but growth investors should love this Buffett stock.
