(MRUS): The Biotech Stock with Biggest Upside Potential Noor Ul Ain Rehman Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 7:08 PM 5 min read In This Article: MRUS -3.25% We recently published a list of the 12 Biotech Stocks with the Biggest Upside Potential . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merus N.V. (NASDAQ: MRUS ) stands against other biotech stocks with the biggest upside potential. Improving Trends for Biotech Stocks While 2024 was a \u201cchallenging\u201d year for biotech stocks, JPMorgan is of the view that some names in the industry may be poised for considerable upside in the coming months. On November 28, Johan Hueffer, senior partner and principal of investments at Novo Holdings, appeared on CNBC to discuss his macro perspective on investments in life sciences. He said that biotechs faced difficulty raising capital in the last couple of years. However, that trend has started to improve in the last quarter or two. Still, there have been impacts on companies that particularly service the pharmaceutical industry, such as contract research organizations (CROs), contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), and companies that provide tools for research and development. Similar trends have been observed for companies that manufacture tools for production in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. While these sectors have had ups and downs in the past two years, the trends are starting to normalize now. Hueffer was of the view that the industry is now showing considerable opportunity. The Fed\u2019s Rate Cuts and Biotech Stocks: Could There Be a Connection? Similarly, Goldman Sachs shed light on biotech as an often overlooked sector in the investing space. In a note to clients, John Flood, Goldman\u2019s Head of Americas Equities Sales Trading, said that biotech stocks posed an under-the-radar opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the Fed\u2019s recent rate cuts. Changes in interest rates uniquely affect biotech stocks as they are sensitive to them and often rely on projected future profits. These stocks are also heavily impacted by the cost of capital. Although there is little to no current profitability, these stocks have significant upside potential and pose an \u201coption-like structure\u201d if clinical trials succeed. This makes them especially responsive to changes and movements in interest rates. Since September, the Fed cut a full point off the funds rate. According to CNBC, the current market pricing is showing just one or two more moves lower in 2025. On January 8, CNBC reported that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members voted to reduce the central bank\u2019s benchmark borrowing rate to the 4.25%-4.5% target range. However, they also slashed their outlook for expected rate cuts for 2025, bringing it down to two from four and assuming quarter-point increments. These changes are expected to affect biotech stocks. Story Continues Flood\u2019s note also highlighted that the biotech industry has recently shown improved fundamentals, attributed to a more favorable regulatory environment and positive clinical outcomes. Despite these tailwinds, Goldman\u2019s data reflects that biotechnology remains under-owned by hedge funds. The sector ranked in the 13th percentile in hedge fund long/short positioning over the past year. Furthermore, it ranked in the 4th percentile over the past five years. Our Methodology We used the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of 40 biotech stocks. We then selected the top 12 stocks with the highest analyst upside potential as of January 15, 2025. We have also included the market capitalization of the stocks as of the same date. The list is sorted in ascending order of analysts\u2019 average upside potential. These stocks are also popular among elite hedge funds, as of fiscal Q3 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small cap and large cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ( see more details here ). 12 Biotech Stocks with the Biggest Upside Potential A scientist looking through a microscope conducting research in an immuno-oncology lab. Merus N.V. (NASDAQ: MRUS ) Analyst Upside: 122.95% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48 Merus N.V. (NASDAQ:MRUS) is a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company that discovers and develops bispecific antibody therapeutics. Its product pipeline includes Biclonics to treat solid and hematological tumors. On January 12, the company announced a research collaboration and license agreement with Biohaven Ltd. (NYSE:BHVN) to co-develop three novel bispecific antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). The partnership is expected to expand the company\u2019s portfolio. The company attained FDA approval for its BIZENGRI\u00ae (zenocutuzumab-zbco) drug, the first and only treatment for adults with pancreatic adenocarcinoma or non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This put the company on a positive trajectory. Merus N.V. (NASDAQ:MRUS) strengthened its financial position in fiscal Q3 2024. It reported $433 million in cash and cash equivalents, up from $204 million at the end of 2023. This growth was attributed to successful public offerings and strategic partnerships. Merus N.V.\u00a0(NASDAQ:MRUS) ranks fourth on our list of the 12 biotech stocks with the biggest upside potential. TimesSquare Capital Management U.S. Small Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Merus N.V. (NASDAQ:MRUS) in its Q2 2024 investor letter : \u201cOur preferences among Health Care stocks are those companies providing novel therapies for unmet needs that deserve premium pricing, or specialized service providers. A new addition this quarter is Merus N.V. (NASDAQ:MRUS), a clinical-stage immune-oncology biotechnology company. Their pipeline consists of several programs targeting solid tumors with various bispecific antibodies.\u201d Overall, MRUS ranks 4th on our list of the 12 biotech stocks with the biggest upside potential. While we acknowledge the potential of biotech stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Anticipated Milestones at the 43rd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference; Reports Positive Degrader Data with Rapid, Deep, and Selective Lowering of Galactose-Deficient IgA1 with Next Generation Potential Therapy for IgA Nephropathy PR Newswire Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 7:15 PM 23 min read In This Article: BHVN -1.41% Presents progress and new anticipated milestones across portfolio of more than 10 assets and 6 therapeutic areas. Announces multiple advancements across the MoDE TM (molecular degraders of extracellular proteins) platform and the next generation TRAP TM (targeted removal of aberrant protein) degraders, including: IgA Nephropathy (IgAN) program: First-in-human dosing with BHV-1400, a next generation TRAP degrader, achieved rapi\u00add, deep, and selective lowering of only aberrant galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1), the antibody causing IgA nephropathy, while sparing normal IgA. This selective and rapid approach to immunoglobulin lowering represents a second-generation therapeutic approach to IgAN, potentially allowing for strong disease control with less acute or long-term safety risks associated with complement inhibition or broad antibody suppression. The first and lowest dose tested (125mg) of BHV-1400 in the ongoing Phase 1 achieved rapid lowering of Gd-IgA1 with a median reduction of 60% within four hours of administration after a single dose. Maximal reduction exceeding 70% was observed within eight hours. Reductions were sustained for days even after a single dose. This rapid reduction of Gd-IgA1 is unprecedented in drugs targeting Gd-IgA1 and could allow for potential indications in situations where rapid Gd-IgA1 lowering could be beneficial in addition to chronic active disease and long-term maintenance. BHV-1400 has been safe and well-tolerated in the Phase 1 study to date and demonstrated no clinically significant changes in innate or adaptive immunity, including white blood cells and immunoglobulins IgG, IgA, IgE, and IgM. There were no clinically significant reductions in albumin, liver function test abnormalities, or increases in cholesterol compared to baseline. No dose limiting toxicities have been observed in the Phase 1 to date and further dose escalation is planned to explore the full range of Gd-IgA1 reductions possible with BHV-1400. A pivotal trial in\u00a0IgA nephropathy is planned using an accelerated regulatory path forward upon completion of the Phase 1 trial. Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) program: First-in-human dosing\u00a0with BHV-1600, a TRAP degrader of \u03b21AR autoantibodies, was initiated and has been well-tolerated to date after the first two dose cohorts without clinically relevant changes in innate or adaptive immunity, including white blood cells and immunoglobulins IgG, IgA, IgE, and IgM. There were no clinically significant reductions in albumin, liver function test abnormalities, or increases in cholesterol compared to baseline. \u03b21AR autoantibodies are thought to cause peripartum cardiomyopathy, a rare form of heart failure that develops at the end of pregnancy or in the months following delivery and in severe cases, can be life-threatening. BHV-1600 has been shown to bind to \u03b21AR autoantibodies in preclinical studies and biomarker levels will be measured in women with PPCM later in development. Completed INTERACT meeting with FDA regarding BHV-1600 in 4Q 2024; gained alignment for the study design to potentially pursue an accelerated approval pathway in PPCM. IgG degrader programs: BHV-1300: Advanced optimized subcutaneous formulation with deep reductions of targeted IgG >60% demonstrated in the lowest dose cohort of the MAD, in line with modeling projections and with differentiated safety profile. There were no clinically significant reductions in IgG3, IgA, IgE, IgM, or albumin, no liver function test abnormalities, nor increases in cholesterol compared to baseline. Phase 1 completing last remaining dose cohorts with the optimized subcutaneous formulation in 1H 2025. Lead indication for BHV-1300 announced in Graves' Disease, a common autoimmune disorder affecting approximately 80 million people globally. Graves' Disease is caused by IgG1 autoantibodies that hyperstimulate the TSH receptor, causing hyperthyroidism can result in the need for surgical removal, chemical ablation of the thyroid, or need for chronic anti-thyroid drugs. Additional programs in rheumatoid arthritis and myasthenia gravis also continue to be pursued with BHV-1300 and 1310. Study May Proceed letter received from FDA for BHV-1310 IND, a novel IgG degrader and Phase 1 initiating in 1H 2025. BHV-1300 and BHV-1310 are similar but will optimize therapeutic targeting and facilitate broader commercial development options. Next generation degrader targets advancing in 2025 include: IgG4 specific degrader, PLA2R autoantibody degrader for membranous nephropathy, pro-insulin autoantibody degrader for type 1 diabetes, and TSH receptor autoantibody degrader as a selective follow-on asset for Graves' Disease. Story Continues Progresses ion channel programs for bipolar, depression, epilepsy and pain: BHV-7000, a selective activator of Kv7.2/7.3 potassium channels: Continues to advance in clinical trials for bipolar disorder, depression, and epilepsy with multiple readouts over the next year, including expected topline for bipolar in 1H 2025 and depression in 2H 2025. BHV-2100, a TRPM3 ion channel antagonist: Preliminary data from an innovative laser-evoked hyperalgesia study with BHV-2100 reduced laser heat-induced pain and brain evoked potentials in healthy volunteers. These exciting results with BHV-2100 represent the first clinical proof of concept for the novel TRPM3 inhibitor class in pain, recapitulating powerful preclinical evidence of efficacy for this approach across a spectrum of pain disorders. Highlights expansion of Biohaven's antibody drug conjugate (ADC) portfolio in Oncology, including: BHV-1510, a Trop2-directed ADC using a novel topoisomerase 1 (TopoIx) payload: Demonstration of early Phase 1 clinical activity, including tumor shrinkage, and safety with BHV-1510 in advanced or metastatic epithelial tumors. Based upon these results, Biohaven has entered into an expanded collaboration agreement with GeneQuantum providing exclusivity to the TopoIx payload for up to 18 ADC targets. BHV-1530, a FGFR3-directed ADC using the TopoIx payload: US IND clearance received for BHV-1530, potential indications include urothelial cancers and other solid tumors driven by FGFR3 alterations and/or upregulated FGFR3 protein expression. The first-in-human study is planned to commence in 1H 2025. Announced a multi-target collaboration with Merus, an oncology-focused biotechnology company developing innovative, multi-specific (Biclonics \u00ae and Triclonics \u00ae ) antibodies, to co-develop three programs encompassing highly differentiated next generation dual-targeted bispecific ADCs leveraging Biohaven's proprietary conjugation and payload technologies and Merus' leading Biclonics technology platform. Key late-stage programs advancing across important indications in 2025 also include: BHV-8000, a highly selective, brain-penetrant TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor that avoids class risks associated with JAK2/3 inhibition, expected to initiate pivotal trials in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease in 2025. Taldefgrobep alfa, a novel myostatin inhibitor optimized to block two key regulators of muscle and fat metabolism, continues to be developed in spinal muscular atrophy and obesity. New Drug Application (NDA) for troriluzole in all SCA genotypes was submitted to the FDA, following completion of pre-NDA meeting in 4Q 2024. Troriluzole has Orphan Drug and Fast-Track designations and qualifies for potential Priority Review. Awaiting filing decision from FDA and preparing for potential commercial launch in 2025 if approved. NEW HAVEN, Conn. , Jan. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0Biohaven Ltd. (NYSE: BHVN) (\"Biohaven\"), a global clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative and transformative therapies to treat individuals with rare and common diseases, today highlighted broad portfolio progress at the 43 rd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, including positive Phase 1 data for BHV-1400, its highly differentiated investigational therapeutic for IgA nephropathy. BHV-1400 is a second generation TRAP\u2122 degrader from its proprietary MoDE\u2122 platform. A copy of the slide presentation is available on the Events and Presentations section of the Biohaven website. Figure 1: IgA Nephropathy Is Caused by Excess Production of Galactose Deficient |gA1 (Gd-IgA1) Vlad Coric , M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Biohaven, commented, \"While we are excited about the significant progress across our entire portfolio, the first-ever data of a TRAP degrader in humans is monumental and unparalleled.\u00a0The ability to only remove aberrant proteins causing disease while leaving all other immune functioning intact will usher in a new era of precision immunology. As quickly as science can identify new disease-causing proteins, our technology can quickly advance treatments for patients. I am proud of our dedicated, passionate and gifted team's unrelenting drive to transform medical care for patients suffering from severe diseases.\" Biohaven 2025 Portfolio Review and Anticipated Milestones Biohaven is positioned to achieve significant milestones in 2025 across a broad spectrum of early- and late-stage programs targeting indications with high unmet need: Molecular Degrader of Extracellular Proteins (MoDE) Platform: Biohaven's novel immune-modulating extracellular degrader platform harnesses selectivity, rapidity, and patient-friendly self-administration to remove disease-causing proteins from the body to potentially treat a wide range of diseases. Biohaven introduced next generation TRAP degraders, which are highly selective, each targeting a specific disease-causing protein for proteolysis. Four INDs for MoDE and next generation TRAP degrader molecules (targeting IgG1, IgG2, IgG4 , Gd-IgA1, and \u03b21AR autoantibodies) have been accepted by the FDA in 2024 with several additional investigational agents in development. Three assets have been dosed in Phase 1 trials with the fourth anticipated to be dosed in the first half of 2025. The first-of-its-kind molecule, BHV-1300 is being developed for the treatment of common immune-mediated diseases, such as Graves' Disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis. With patient-centered design, Biohaven has advanced a proprietary subcutaneous formulation of BHV-1300 and has entered into an agreement with Ypsomed, to develop and manufacture BHV-1300 in an easy-to-use, autoinjector for self-administration. This BHV-1300 proprietary formulation has demonstrated deep and targeted reductions of IgG, with reductions > 60% within four hours and 70% reduction within eight hours in the lowest subcutaneous dose tested in the MAD. Reductions were sustained even after just a single dose administration. Targeted IgG reductions (IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4, over IgG3) have been consistent with projected modeling. Phase 1 dose escalation is completing in 1H 2025, with Graves' Disease Phase 2 trial to initiate mid-year. BHV-1300 was rationally designed to spare IgG3 to preserve host immune defense. The selectivity of BHV-1300 demonstrated in the Phase 1 trial establishes a differentiated safety profile for the treatment of autoimmune disease relative to other IgG-lowering agents and validates the precision of the platform. BHV-1400 and BHV-1600, currently in Phase 1 clinical trials, represent the next generation TRAP degraders focused on selectively clearing very specific pathogenic antibodies, while sparing healthy immunoglobulin to preserve immune function. TRAP molecules commence a new age of immune-modulating treatments, targeted removal of disease-causing proteins for removal while sparing the normal function of the healthy immune system. Data from the first, and lowest, dose cohort of BHV-1400 demonstrated clear differentiation from competitors in the IgA nephropathy space, with rapid lowering of Gd-IgA1 within four hours and preservation of host immunoglobulins including IgG, IgA, IgE, and IgM. IgA nephropathy is a rare chronic kidney disease affecting young and middle-aged adults that is caused by Gd-IgA1 and leads to kidney failure in up to 40% of patients within 10-20 years. Taken in total, the selectivity of MoDE and TRAP degraders demonstrated to date refine immune-modulating treatment representing a clear next generation of drug development technology in immunoglobulin and extracellular protein lowering. Existing mechanisms, both pharmaceutical and device (plasmapheresis), broadly reduce immunoglobulins subclasses and/or isotypes, leading to inefficient dosing, safety risks, necessity of procedures, delays in therapy, and potential efficacy impacts. MoDE and TRAP's new paradigm builds off the prior successes of immune modulation, while also providing a novel technology to fine tune therapies for immune-mediated diseases. As described below, the implications and applications of this selective targeting could be multi-organ, multi-disease. IgA Nephropathy (IgAN) Program: First-in-human dosing with BHV-1400 achieved rapid, deep, and selective lowering of only Gd-IgA1, the aberrant antibody that causes IgA nephropathy, while sparing normal IgA. The first and lowest dose tested (125 mg) of BHV-1400 in Phase 1 achieved rapid lowering of Gd-IgA1 with a median reduction of 60% within four hours of administration. Maximal reduction exceeding 70% was observed within eight hours. Even after just a single dose administration of BHV-1400, reductions in Gd-IgA1 were sustained for days. The rapid reduction of Gd-IgA1 by BHV-1400 is unprecedented in drugs targeting Gd-IgA1 and could allow for potential indications in situations where rapid Gd-IgA1 lowering could be beneficial in addition to chronic active disease and long-term maintenance. The selective and rapid approach to Gd-IgA1 lowering of BHV-1400 represents a second-generation therapeutic approach to IgAN, potentially allowing for effective disease control with less acute- or long-term safety risks associated with B-cell directed therapy, complement inhibitors, or broad immunosuppression. BHV-1400 has been safe and well-tolerated in the Phase 1 study to date and demonstrated no clinically significant changes in innate or adaptive immune systems, including white blood cells and immunoglobulins IgG, IgA, IgE, and IgM, and no clinically significant reductions in albumin, liver function test abnormalities, or increases in cholesterol compared to baseline. There have been no dose limiting toxicities observed in the Phase 1 study and dose escalation continues to explore the full range of Gd-IgA1 reductions possible with BHV-1400. A pivotal trial in IgA nephropathy is planned using an accelerated regulatory path upon completion of the Phase 1 trial. Additional opportunities in situations when rapid Gd-IgA1 reduction could be beneficial may also be feasible given the demonstrated dosing kinetics in the Phase 1 study. Biohaven further expands its renal franchise with the degrader platform, developing several investigational TRAPs for the treatment of immune-mediated renal disease, including a TRAP degrader to target PLA2R autoantibodies for the treatment of membranous nephropathy among others. Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) program: First-in-human dosing with BHV-1600 has been safe and well-tolerated to date after two dose cohorts without clinically relevant changes in innate or adaptive immune systems, including white blood cells and immunoglobulins IgG, IgA, IgE, and IgM, and no clinically significant reductions in albumin, liver function test abnormalities, or increases in cholesterol compared to baseline. \u03b21AR autoantibodies are thought to cause peripartum cardiomyopathy, a rare form of heart failure with no approved therapy that occurs at the end of pregnancy or following delivery and in severe cases, can be life-threatening. BHV-1600 has been shown to bind to \u03b21AR autoantibodies in preclinical studies and biomarker levels will be measured in women with PPCM later in development. Completed INTERACT meeting with FDA regarding BHV-1600 in 4Q 2024 and gained alignment for the study design to potentially pursue an accelerated approval pathway in PPCM, a rare autoimmune life-threatening disease with no approved therapy. IgG MoDE degrader program: BHV-1300 Phase 1 is completing the last remaining dose cohorts with expected completion in 1H 2025. Study May Proceed letter received from the FDA for the BHV-1310 IND and Phase 1 initiating in 1H 2025. Lead indication for BHV-1300 announced in Graves' Disease, a common autoimmune disorder affecting approximately 3 million in the US and 80 million globally. Graves' Disease is caused by IgG1 autoantibodies that hyperstimulate the TSH receptor, causing hyperthyroidism and can result in the need for surgical removal, chemical ablation of the thyroid, or need for chronic anti-thyroid drug therapy. Additional programs in rheumatoid arthritis and myasthenia gravis also to be pursued with BHV-1300 and 1310.

Topline data from two Phase 3 OCD trials in 1H 2025 and 2H 2025, respectively. Taldefgrobep alfa: Taldefgrobep is a novel myostatin inhibitor that is optimized to block both myostatin and activin A signaling, two key regulators of muscle and fat metabolism. Biohaven is studying taldefgrobep in a global Phase 3 expansion study in Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), as an adjunctive therapy to enhance muscle mass and function in patients treated with standard-of-care therapies. Analyses of prespecified subgroups by race and ethnicity demonstrated that the largest study population (87% Caucasian; n=180) showed clinically meaningful improvements on the MFM-32 at all timepoints, including Week 48, compared to the corresponding placebo+SOC group (p < 0.05), though the overall primary endpoint was not met. \u00a0\u00a0Robust target engagement (myostatin reduction) and beneficial impacts on body composition parameters (fat mass, lean muscle mass, and bone density) were noted, offering\u00a0a potential paradigm shift in the treatment of obesity with opportunity to improve quality of weight loss; lower total body weight by specifically reducing fat mass while also preserving or increasing lean muscle mass. Upcoming milestones in the taldefgrobep program include: Expected FDA meeting to discuss SMA registrational path in 1H 2025. Initiate taldefgrobep Phase 2 study in obesity in 1H 2025. BHV-8000: BHV-8000 is a highly selective, oral, brain-penetrant, selective TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor with broad potential for neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders. In the Phase 1 SAD/MAD study in healthy participants, BHV-8000 was generally safe and well-tolerated while producing significant reductions in inflammatory biomarkers relative to placebo. Target indications for BHV-8000 include Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, prevention of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), and multiple sclerosis (MS). In 2024, Biohaven completed interactions with FDA enabling registrational programs for Parkinson's disease and the prevention of ARIA. Upcoming milestones in the BHV-8000 program include: Initiate BHV-8000 Phase 2/3 study in Parkinson's disease in 1H 2025 Advance Alzheimer's, MS and ARIA programs in 2025. Oncology antibody drug conjugate (ADC) portfolio: BHV-1510 (Trop2 ADC): Preliminary data from the initial Phase 1 study dosing cohorts of BHV-1510 have demonstrated promising clinical activity, including tumor shrinkage, with a tolerable safety profile of the novel topoisomerase 1 (TopoIx) payload. The Phase 1/2 study of BHV-1510 is progressing with robust enrollment in dose escalation and optimization, both as monotherapy and in combination with the anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody Libtayo \u00ae (cemiplimab-rwlc) through a clinical supply agreement with Regeneron. Preclinically, TopoIx has shown increased immunogenic cell death and synergistic activity when combined with anti-PD1/L1 checkpoint inhibitors, and a differentiated nonclinical toxicity profile; Clinical activity has been seen across dose cohorts tested to date, including the lowest dose tested of 2mg/kg Q3W; Early PK data demonstrates a stable ADC with very low serum concentrations of free payload; Preliminary safety data demonstrates a favorable profile, with no payload-associated interstitial lung disease, gastrointestinal toxicities, or significant hematological toxicities observed in early cohorts. The main toxicity observed thus far in Phase 1 study has been stomatitis, an expected on-target Trop2 class toxicity that has been manageable; Combination cohorts of BHV-1510 with Libtayo \u00ae have initiated. Based on these encouraging early results, Biohaven has entered into an expanded collaboration agreement with GeneQuantum, which provides broad target exclusivity for up to 18 ADC targets incorporating the novel topoisomerase 1 inhibitor (TopoIx) payload. Biohaven has incorporated the TopoIx payload into its next clinical-stage investigational agent, BHV-1530. BHV-1530 is an FGFR3-directed ADC with potential indications in cancers driven by FGFR3 alterations and/or upregulated FGFR3 protein expression, including urothelial cancers and other solid tumors. While FGFR3 has been clinically validated as a target in oncology, there are no other FGFR3 ADCs currently in clinical development. Biohaven retains global rights for BHV-1530 under the agreement via an exclusive license with GeneQuantum and Aimed Bio. The US IND has been opened, and a first-in-human study for solid tumors is planned for 1H 2025. In addition, Biohaven today announced a multi-target collaboration with Merus, an oncology-focused biotechnology company developing innovative, multi-specific (Biclonics \u00ae and Triclonics \u00ae ) antibodies.

Collaboration to Co-Develop Three Novel Bispecific ADC Programs Merus N.V. Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 4:04 AM 8 min read In This Article: MRUS -3.25% BHVN -1.41% Merus N.V. NEW HAVEN, Conn. and UTRECHT, The Netherlands and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Jan. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biohaven Ltd. (NYSE: BHVN) and Merus N.V. (Nasdaq:MRUS), today announced a research collaboration and license agreement to co-develop three novel bispecific antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), leveraging Merus\u2019 leading Biclonics \u00ae technology platform, and Biohaven\u2019s next-generation ADC conjugation and payload platform technologies. Under the terms of the agreement, Biohaven is responsible for the preclinical ADC generation of three Merus bispecific antibodies under mutually agreed research plans. The agreement includes two Merus bispecific programs generated using the Biclonics \u00ae platform, and one program under preclinical research by Merus. Each program is subject to mutual agreement for advancement to further development, with the parties then sharing subsequent external development costs and commercialization, if advanced. \u201dWe\u2019re excited to collaborate with Biohaven, leveraging their broad range of linker/payload and conjugation technologies, and expertise with the research and development of ADCs, to rapidly advance bispecific antibody candidate ADCs based on the Merus Biclonics \u00ae platform,\u201d said Peter B. Silverman, Chief Operating Officer of Merus. \"We believe that the combination of our Biclonics \u00ae technology, validated by the recent FDA approval of Bizengri \u00ae and continued clinical success with petosemtamab, together with the Biohaven suite of ADC technologies, has the potential to generate new and differentiated bispecific therapies with greater potency and selectivity over currently available monoclonal ADC approaches.\u201d \"We believe this collaboration with Merus will accelerate our ability to create highly differentiated multispecific ADCs, leveraging Biohaven\u2019s innovative conjugation and payload technologies to deliver optimized ADCs with the potential to significantly benefit patients across various cancer types through an enhanced efficacy and safety profile,\" added Brian Lestini, President, Oncology of Biohaven. Pursuant to the transaction, Merus will receive an upfront payment and license fee at ADC candidate nomination of the first program, with Merus to assume the preclinical bispecific antibody generation cost, and Biohaven to assume the preclinical ADC generation cost. Thereafter, upon mutual agreement to advance each program, the parties plan to share further development and commercialization costs.

Shares editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Fri, Jan 3, 2025, 1:04 PM 3 min read In This Article: BHVN -1.41% Biohaven Ltd. ( NYSE:BHVN ) shareholders (or potential shareholders) will be happy to see that the Independent Director, John Childs, recently bought a whopping US$1.0m worth of stock, at a price of US$35.94. While that only increased their holding size by 0.4%, it is still a big swing by our standards. View our latest analysis for Biohaven The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Biohaven In fact, the recent purchase by Independent Director John Childs was not their only acquisition of Biohaven shares this year. Earlier in the year, they paid US$41.00 per share in a US$8.0m purchase. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$37.28. It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when insiders have purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price. While Biohaven insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction! NYSE:BHVN Insider Trading Volume January 3rd 2025 There are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. If investing in lesser known companies is your style, you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them). Insider Ownership Of Biohaven Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Biohaven insiders own about US$436m worth of shares (which is 12% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders. So What Do The Biohaven Insider Transactions Indicate? It is good to see the recent insider purchase. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. But on the other hand, the company made a loss during the last year, which makes us a little cautious. Once you factor in the high insider ownership, it certainly seems like insiders are positive about Biohaven. Looks promising! So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Our analysis shows 4 warning signs for Biohaven (2 can't be ignored!) and we strongly recommend you look at them before investing.

(BHVN) the Best Weight Loss Stock to Buy Now According to Hedge Funds? Laiba Immad Tue, Dec 17, 2024, 2:06 PM 8 min read In This Article: BHVN -1.41% We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Weight Loss Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Biohaven Ltd. (NYSE:BHVN) stands against the other weight loss stocks. The Revolution in Obesity Treatment: Opportunities and Challenges of GLP-1 Medications Most people have at some point sought to include weight loss and physical exercise in their daily life. The weight loss and fitness market is quite substantial worldwide since improving one's fitness can have direct physical and psychological benefits. Over one billion people worldwide\u2014650 million adults, 340 million adolescents, and 39 million children\u2014are obese, according to the WHO. A novel class of weight-loss medications that don't include strict exercise regimens or diets seems to be revolutionary. People who are overweight or obese can lose 15% to 20% of their body weight with the aid of these ground-breaking medications. According to Andy Acker, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, \"This may be the largest opportunity we've ever seen in the pharmaceutical industry.\" Weight-loss medications are undoubtedly well-liked. Investors are drawing comparisons between the leader in artificial intelligence chips and the US pioneer in weight-loss drugs. Given this increase in demand, Morgan Stanley Research has raised its forecast for the worldwide obesity medication market from $77 billion to $105 billion by 2030. Branded obesity medications brought approximately $6 billion in 2023. According to Forbes, the most prescribed Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 GLP-1 agonist in 2023 was Semaglutide, the market leader for obesity medications and the generic form of Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus. It accounted for almost 88% of all new prescriptions. At present, the FDA has approved just three GLP-1 medications for weight control: tirzepatide, liraglutide, and semaglutide. By 2030, the GLP-1 market is expected to grow to $100 billion, driven equally by obesity and diabetes, according to JP Morgan Research. Thirty million GLP-1 users, or around 9% of the population, may be in the US by 2030. The rising demand for obesity drugs will have a broad effect, helping industries like biotech but creating challenges for others like the food and beverage industry. According to Chris Schott, a Senior Analyst specializing in the U.S. Diversified Biopharma industry, \u201cGLP-1s have been used to treat T2D since 2005, starting with the approval of Byetta, with follow-on products continually improving on efficacy. The most recent, Ozempic and Mounjaro, offer significant advantages over previous products and have accelerated class growth,\u201d \u201cIndeed, the newest generations of GLP-1s and combos lead to 15-25+% weight loss on average, well above prior generations of products.\u201d Story Continues Some are praising the most recent generation of GLP-1 pharmaceuticals as \"miracle drugs\" for the treatment of obesity. However, because GLP-1s are expensive and have limited insurance coverage, not all obese people can use them. According to Jonathan Gruber, a professor of economics and the chairman of MIT's economics department, the annual cost of treating 40% of obese Americans at the current rate\u2014roughly $15,000 per person\u2014would surpass $1 trillion. That's almost the same as the government spends on the entire Medicare program. That's a staggering figure. GLP-1 Medications: Balancing Rising Demand, Shortages, and Market Potential According to a study released in the Annals of Internal Medicine, the use of GLP-1 medications, including semaglutide, for weight loss has increased over the last ten years, while it has dropped by about 10% among those with type 2 diabetes. The researchers warn that the ensuing extended drug scarcity may limit the treatments' availability to diabetics. Dr. Yee Hui Yeo, a clinical fellow in Cedars-Sina's Karsh Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, emphasized that it is crucial to ensure that diabetic patients have access to GLP-1 therapies as the demand for obesity medications increases. According to the FDA, growing demand is the cause of the shortages. The European Medicines Agency warned that the GLP-1 medicine shortage is a \"major public health concern\" that is unlikely to be resolved in 2024, indicating that the shortages affect more than only the US. According to NPR, shortages have made it difficult for those with diabetes to get their prescriptions, and some have had to reduce the medications they can use. The potential of GLP-1 medications, which were first created to treat diabetes but are currently being used to treat obesity, was covered by the panelists on \"Weighing the Future of Obesity Drugs,\" which included Julia Angeles of Baillie Gifford, Debra Netschert of Jennison Investments, and Gentry Lee of Fayez Serofim. Netschert highlighted ongoing efforts to further reduce injection frequency and minimize adverse responses, as well as the development of GLP-1 medicine delivery from weekly dosages to multiple daily injections. Despite their exceptional efficacy, Netschert noted that due to supply limits, 1.5 million of the 110 million eligible patients in the US are now receiving therapy with GLP-1 medications. In their disagreement over who should foot the bill, Netschert pointed to significant insurance and Medicare/Medicaid reimbursements, while Angeles asserted that most patients pay cash. According to Netschert, up to 700 million people globally might require these medications outside of American borders. Notably, the panel found that GLP-1 medications were approved more quickly in the United Kingdom than in any other country, indicating their perceived value. The UK payors are generally stringent. Since the market for obesity medications is still in its infancy, it would be a good idea to add several weight reduction stocks to your watchlists. Our Methodology For this list, we scanned through holdings of weight loss ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 weight loss stocks. From that list, we picked 12 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024, based on data tracked by the Insider Monkey database. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ( see more details here ). A pharmacist in a white coat with a range of drugs on shelves behind her. Biohaven Ltd. (NYSE: BHVN ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42 Biohaven Ltd. (NYSE:BHVN) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for neurological, immunological, and oncological diseases. Its pipeline includes drugs for conditions like epilepsy, migraines, OCD, SMA, obesity, and cancer. Key drug candidates are BHV-7000 (Kv7 activator), Troriluzole (tripeptide prodrug), and Taldefgrobep (HV-2000) for obesity. Biohaven Ltd. (NYSE:BHVN) is developing taldefgrobep alfa, which is a myostatin inhibitor targeting obesity through a unique mechanism that increases lean muscle mass and resting metabolism. It stands eighth on our list of the best weight loss stocks . Unlike GLP-1 agonists, which often reduce both fat and muscle, taldefgrobep promotes fat loss while preserving and enhancing lean mass. Preclinical and early human trials show significant fat reduction (11% in mice) and a 25% increase in lean muscle. Additional benefits include improved metabolic health, with lower insulin and leptin levels observed in treated mice. Taldefgrobep has demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with no serious adverse events in over 500 patients in prior SMA trials. In the third quarter of 2024, Biohaven Ltd. (NYSE:BHVN) reported a net loss of $160.3 million ($1.70 per share), an increase from the net loss of $102.6 million ($1.50 per share) in the same period in 2023. The non-GAAP adjusted net loss was $164.1 million ($1.74 per share), up from $98.1 million ($1.44 per share) in Q3 2023. This increase in net loss was primarily attributed to higher research and development (R&D) and general and administrative (G&A) expenses. Biohaven Ltd. (NYSE:BHVN)'s R&D expenses rose significantly to $157.6 million, up from $95.5 million in Q3 2023, due to ongoing clinical trials and preclinical research. Additionally, G&A expenses increased to $20.6 million from $15.0 million in the same period last year, reflecting higher share-based compensation. Despite these challenges, the company saw an improvement in other income, which surged to $17.8 million from $4.7 million in Q3 2023. This increase was largely driven by changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities and higher investment income. Analysts hold a consensus Strong Buy rating on the stock and as of Q3 2024, 42 hedge funds held shares in the company. Overall BHVN ranks 8th on our list of the best weight loss stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

Immunotherapy: Significant IgG Reduction Achieved with BHV-1300, Gains Analyst Approval Vandana Singh Tue, Dec 17, 2024, 10:23 PM 3 min read In This Article: BHVN -1.41% Biohaven Advances in Immunotherapy: Significant IgG Reduction Achieved with BHV-1300, Gains Analyst Approval On Monday, Biohaven Ltd. (NYSE: BHVN ) revealed clinical and regulatory milestones across its proprietary Molecular Degrader of Extracellular Proteins (MoDE) platform and its glutamate modulation and ion channel programs . Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is\u00a0a protein that helps prevent infections and is the most common type of antibody in the body. Elevated IgG levels can be seen in chronic active infection or inflammation. Subcutaneously administered BHV-1300 achieved deep lowering of targeted IgG, with reductions >60% in the lowest subcutaneous dose tested in the ongoing multiple ascending dose (MAD) study. William Blair highlights that greater than 60% was the minimum efficacy bar for IgG reductions based on comparable data from argenx Inc's (NASDAQ: ARGX ) subcutaneous efgartigimod, which showed a mean total IgG reduction of 66.4% from baseline at day 29 but is not currently available in an autoinjector formulation. Also Read: Biohaven Stock Spikes After Drug Candidate To Treat Rare Neurodegenerative Disease Shows Promise Subcutaneous BHV-1300 achieved a progressive reduction in IgG within hours of each weekly dose administration in the MAD, and pharmacodynamic effects were sustained relative to baseline over the four-week study period. There were no clinically significant effects on albumin or liver function, and no increases in cholesterol were noted. Plasma IgG3 levels were preserved through the end of study week 4 to allow for healthy immune effector functioning. Escalating dose level cohorts of subcutaneous BHV-1300 are ongoing to explore the full range of IgG reductions possible with BHV-1300 for a wide range of future disease indications. Biohaven also announced the regulatory acceptance of three INDs and/or CTAs for its next-generation MoDE molecules, which target other immune-mediated diseases. Achieving >60% IgG reduction checks an important competitive box, says a William Blair analyst, and puts the IgG-lowering profile on par with other therapies. William Blair still questions the overall PK/PD profile since the data curves were not included in this update. This information will be key to understanding how BHV-1300 compares to other IgG-lowering therapies, and looks forward to seeing more data in Q1 2025. In the meantime, the analyst recognizes the potential benefits of improved safety and convenience with this program compared to other IgG-lowering therapies. Additionally, views the Ypsomed partnership as a positive step for the broader MoDE platform. The analyst maintains an Outperform rating on Biohaven ahead of a potentially catalyst-heavy 2025. Story Continues Price Action: BHVN stock is down 5.54% at $39.15 at the last check on Tuesday.
