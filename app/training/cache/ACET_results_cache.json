[{"text": "Adicet Bio Provides Corporate Update and Highlights Expected 2025 Milestones Business Wire Thu, Jan 9, 2025, 12:10 AM 7 min read In This Article: ACET +1.41% Adicet made significant progress in 2024 and is well-positioned for success in 2025: Advancing Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating ADI-001 across six autoimmune diseases; preliminary data in lupus nephritis (LN) patients anticipated in 1H25, data from other patient cohorts expected in 2H25 Patient enrollment in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) and stiff person syndrome (SPS) expected to be initiated in 1Q25; initiation of patient enrollment in anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) associated vasculitis (AAV) expected in 2H25 First patient dosed and enrollment ongoing in Phase 1 clinical trial of ADI-270 in metastatic/advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC); preliminary data expected in 1H25 REDWOOD CITY, Calif. & BOSTON, January 08, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Adicet Bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: ACET), a clinical stage biotechnology company discovering and developing allogeneic gamma delta T cell therapies for autoimmune diseases and cancer, today provided corporate updates and highlighted upcoming milestones for 2025. \"2024 was a momentous year for Adicet as we amplified our efforts in autoimmune diseases and solid tumors. We dosed our first patients in our clinical trials evaluating our gamma delta 1 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell candidates, ADI-001 in LN and ADI-270 in ccRCC. Notably, ADI-270 is the first gamma delta CAR T cell therapy to enter clinical development for solid tumors, underscoring our commitment to pioneering innovative treatments. In the first half of 2025, we look forward to reporting preliminary data for both programs,\" said Chen Schor, President and Chief Executive Officer at Adicet Bio. \"Within our autoimmune portfolio, the successful expansion of our Phase 1 trial of ADI-001 into six autoimmune indications, building upon clinical biomarker data demonstrating ADI-001\u2019s robust tissue trafficking and complete CD19+ B cell depletion in secondary lymphoid tissue, further reinforces ADI-001\u2019s potential as an off-the-shelf treatment option. Mr. Schor continued: \"In our oncology pipeline, the initiation of our Phase 1 trial of ADI-270 in ccRCC patients marked a crucial achievement as the first gamma delta 1 CAR T cell product candidate for the treatment of solid tumors. As we look ahead to 2025, we believe we are well positioned to build on this momentum to advance our product candidates to patients living with autoimmune diseases and cancer.\" Clinical Program Progress and Upcoming Milestones: Autoimmune Diseases Clinical Programs In June 2024, the Company announced that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had granted Fast Track Designation to ADI-001 for the potential treatment of relapsed/refractory class III or class IV LN. Story Continues In September 2024, Adicet presented clinical biomarker data from the Phase 1 GLEAN trial of ADI-001 at the 9th Annual CAR-TCR Summit demonstrating robust tissue trafficking resulting in high levels of ADI-001, significant CAR T cell activation, and complete CD19+ B cell depletion in secondary lymphoid tissue. In October 2024, the Company received FDA clearance for an amendment to its Investigational New Drug (IND) application to evaluate ADI-001 in IIM and SPS as part of the Phase 1 trial of ADI-001 in autoimmune diseases. This followed the clearance of an IND amendment in August 2024 to expand clinical development of ADI-001 in the Phase 1 trial beyond LN to include SLE, SSc and AAV. In November 2024, Adicet announced the dosing of the first LN patient in the Phase 1 trial of ADI-001 in autoimmune diseases. The Company expects to initiate enrollment for patients with SLE, SSc, IIM, and SPS in the first quarter of 2025, and for patients with AAV in the second half of 2025. Preliminary clinical data from the Phase 1 trial of ADI-001\u2019s LN patient cohort are anticipated in the first half of 2025. Preliminary data from the Phase 1 trial\u2019s other patient cohorts are expected in the second half of 2025. Hematologic Malignancies and Solid Tumor Clinical Programs In April 2024, Adicet presented preclinical data for ADI-270 at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGCT) showing robust anti-tumor activity in an in vivo model of ccRCC, including tumor infiltration, resistance to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and potent activity via CAR and innate-mediated targeting. In July 2024, the Company announced that FDA Fast Track Designation had been granted to ADI-270 for the potential treatment of patients with metastatic/advanced ccRCC who have been treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor and a vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor. In December 2024, Adicet announced the dosing of the first patient in the Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating ADI-270 in patients with metastatic/advanced ccRCC. Preliminary clinical data from the ADI-270 Phase 1 trial in ccRCC are expected in the first half of 2025. About Adicet Bio, Inc.

Dosed in the Phase 1 Clinical Trial of ADI-270 in Metastatic/Advanced Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma Business Wire Thu, Dec 19, 2024, 3:00 PM 6 min read In This Article: ACET +1.41% Enrollment underway for patients with metastatic/advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) Company expects to share preliminary Phase 1 clinical data in the first half of 2025 REDWOOD CITY, Calif. & BOSTON, December 19, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Adicet Bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: ACET), a clinical stage biotechnology company discovering and developing allogeneic gamma delta T cell therapies for autoimmune diseases and cancer, today announced that the first patient has been dosed in the Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating ADI-270 in patients with metastatic/advanced ccRCC. \"Dosing the first patient in our Phase 1 trial of ADI-270 in metastatic/advanced ccRCC is a significant milestone for Adicet as we advance our first gamma delta 1 CAR T cell product candidate for the treatment of solid tumors, one of the highest unmet needs in oncology,\" said Chen Schor, President and Chief Executive Officer at Adicet Bio. \"Patients with ccRCC, the most common type of kidney cancer, have a pressing need for safe and effective treatments, as current therapies offer limited benefits for patients with advanced disease. Based on ADI-270\u2019s encouraging preclinical data generated to date, in which ADI-270 demonstrated significant tumor infiltration, resistance to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and potent activity via CAR and innate-mediated targeting, we believe ADI-270 has the potential to offer a promising advancement for solid tumors. We anticipate reporting preliminary clinical data from the trial in the first half of 2025.\" About the Phase 1 Trial The Phase 1 multicenter, open-label clinical trial is designed to investigate ADI-270 as monotherapy in adults with relapsed or refractory metastatic/advanced ccRCC. Following lymphodepletion, patients will be eligible to receive a single dose of ADI-270 with a starting dose level of 3E8 CAR+ cells. Subject to meeting protocol defined criteria, patients enrolled in the trial may be eligible to receive a second dose of ADI-270. The dose escalation and dose expansion portions of the trial will evaluate safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics as well as anti-tumor activity as assessed by overall response rate, duration of response and disease control rate.

About ADI-270 ADI-270 is an armored allogeneic \"off-the-shelf\" gamma delta CAR T cell therapy candidate targeting CD70-positive cancers. CD70 is a compelling target due to its high expression in both solid and hematological malignancies. ADI-270 is engineered with a third-generation CAR designed to target CD70 using its natural receptor, CD27, as the binding moiety and is further armored with a dominant negative form of the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 receptor II (dnTGF\u03b2RII) to provide functional resilience to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. ADI-270 is also designed to increase exposure and persistence by reducing susceptibility to host vs. graft elimination. These properties of ADI-270 combined with the potent tumor infiltration demonstrated with gamma delta 1 T cells aim to improve clinical responses of RCC patients and other patients with CD70+ tumors. Story Continues About Renal Cell Carcinoma Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common tumor of the kidney, constituting 80% to 85% of primary renal neoplasms. Clear cell RCC (ccRCC) is the most common subtype, accounting for 80% of all RCCs. ccRCC is an aggressive subtype arising from renal stem cells commonly arising in the proximal nephron and tubular epithelium, and often metastasizes to the lungs, liver, and bones. Approximately 20% of newly diagnosed cases of RCC are locally advanced or metastatic and up to 30% of patients will develop metastatic disease following nephrectomy. While the 5-year survival rate for localized RCC is 93%, the 5-year survival rate for advanced disease is 15%. About Adicet Bio, Inc. Adicet Bio, Inc. is a clinical stage biotechnology company discovering and developing allogeneic gamma delta T cell therapies for autoimmune diseases and cancer. Adicet is advancing a pipeline of \"off-the-shelf\" gamma delta T cells, engineered with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), to facilitate durable activity in patients.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" of Adicet within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 relating to the business and operations of Adicet. The words \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"continue,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"should,\" \"target,\" \"would\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, express or implied statements regarding: Adicet\u2019s expected growth as a company; clinical development and regulatory progress of Adicet\u2019s product candidates; the promising potential of Adicet\u2019s product candidates for autoimmune and oncology indications; and the anticipated contribution of Dr. Maltzman to Adicet\u2019s business. Any forward-looking statements in this press release are based on management\u2019s current expectations and beliefs of future events, and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those set forth in or implied by such forward-looking statements, including without limitation, the effect of global economic conditions and public health emergencies on Adicet\u2019s business and financial results, including with respect to disruptions to our preclinical and clinical studies, business operations, employee hiring and retention, and ability to raise additional capital; Adicet\u2019s ability to execute on its strategy including obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals on the expected timeline, if at all; that positive results, including interim results, from a preclinical or clinical study may not necessarily be predictive of the results of future or ongoing studies; clinical studies may fail to demonstrate adequate safety and efficacy of Adicet\u2019s product candidates, which would prevent, delay, or limit the scope of regulatory approval and commercialization; and regulatory approval processes of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time-consuming, and inherently unpredictable; and Adicet\u2019s ability to meet production and product release expectations. For a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties, and other important factors, any of which could cause Adicet\u2019s actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements, see the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in Adicet\u2019s most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q and subsequent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as well as discussions of potential risks, uncertainties, and other important factors in Adicet\u2019s other filings with the SEC. All information in this press release is as of the date of the release, and Adicet undertakes no duty to update this information unless required by law.

Financial Results and Provides Business Updates Business Wire Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 12:00 AM 9 min read In This Article: ACET +1.41% ADI-001 Phase 1 clinical trial expanded to include a total of six autoimmune disease indications; preliminary clinical data in lupus nephritis (LN) anticipated in 1H25 Strong balance sheet with $202.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of September 30, 2024 REDWOOD CITY, Calif. & BOSTON, November 06, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Adicet Bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: ACET), a clinical stage biotechnology company discovering and developing allogeneic gamma delta T cell therapies for autoimmune diseases and cancer, today reported financial results and operational highlights for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \"Our commitment to delivering best-in-class gamma delta 1 T cell therapies for patients battling autoimmune diseases and cancer is reflected in the expansion of our clinical pipeline in the third quarter. We are now investigating ADI-001 across six autoimmune indications to provide potentially transformative curative therapies for these debilitating diseases. Additionally, in the fourth quarter we plan to open enrollment for our Phase 1 trial of ADI-270 in patients with metastatic/advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), our first gamma delta 1 CAR T cell therapy for solid tumors. This progress highlights the broad and important potential applications of our gamma delta platform,\" said Chen Schor, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Looking ahead, we anticipate advancing enrollment in these trials and expect to share preliminary clinical data from both lupus nephritis with ADI-001 and metastatic/advanced ccRCC with ADI-270 in the first half of 2025.\" Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Operational Highlights: Autoimmune diseases Activated clinical sites in ADI-001 Phase 1 trial in autoimmune diseases. In September 2024, Adicet activated sites for its Phase 1 clinical trial of ADI-001 in autoimmune diseases. The company is exploring the potential of ADI-001 across six indications including LN, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM), stiff person syndrome (SPS) and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) associated vasculitis (AAV). The Company opened enrollment for patients with LN in 4Q24 and expects to initiate enrollment for patients with SLE, SSc, IIM, and SPS in 1Q25, and for patients with AAV in 2H25. The Company plans to report preliminary clinical data from the Phase 1 clinical study of ADI-001 in LN in 1H25, and for other autoimmune diseases in 2H25, subject to study site initiation and patient enrollment. FDA clearance of IND amendment to evaluate ADI-001 in IIM and SPS. In October 2024, Adicet announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared the Company\u2019s Investigational New Drug (IND) amendment application to evaluate ADI-001 in IIM and SPS as part of the Phase 1 clinical trial in autoimmune diseases. Presented ADI-001 clinical biomarker data demonstrating robust tissue trafficking and complete B cell depletion in secondary lymphoid tissue. In September 2024, Adicet presented clinical biomarker data from the Phase 1 GLEAN trial of ADI-001 at the 9th Annual CAR-TCR Summit. The data demonstrated robust tissue trafficking resulting in high levels of ADI-001, significant chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell activation, and complete CD19+ B cell depletion in secondary lymphoid tissue. These findings further reinforce ADI-001's potential as a best-in-class allogeneic cell therapy for autoimmune diseases. Presentation of ADI-001 clinical data at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Convergence 2024. In November 2024, Adicet will present an oral abstract highlighting previously presented ADI-001 clinical biomarker data at ACR Convergence 2024 taking place November 14-19 in Washington, D.C. Story Continues Hematologic malignancies and solid tumor indications ADI-270 Fast Track Designation in metastatic/ advanced ccRCC. In July 2024, Adicet announced that the FDA granted ADI-270 Fast Track Designation for the potential treatment of patients with metastatic/advanced ccRCC who have been treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor and a vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor. Presented ADI-270 data at the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy\u2019s (ASGCT) 2024 Advancing Gene + Cell Therapies for Cancer conference. In October 2024, Adicet presented ADI-270 data in an oral presentation at the ASGCT 2024 Advancing Gene and Cell Therapies for Cancer conference. Corporate Updates Appointed Lloyd Klickstein, M.D., Ph.D. to Board of Directors. In August 2024, Adicet appointed Dr. Lloyd Klickstein to its Board of Directors. Dr. Klickstein brings over two decades of leadership experience in the biopharmaceutical industry and biomedical research, and expertise in rheumatology and immunology to Adicet. Dr. Klickstein currently serves as President and Chief Executive Officer of Koslapp Therapeutics, Inc. and is the Board Chair of the Lupus Foundation of New England. Financial Results for Third Quarter 2024: Research and Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses were $26.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $26.2 million during the same period in 2023. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily due to a $0.9 million increase in laboratory expenses, a $0.8 million increase in payroll and personnel expenses as well as a less than $0.1 million increase in professional fees for the period. This increase was partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in expenses related to contract development manufacturing organizations and other externally conducted research and development and a $0.4 million decrease in allocated facility expenses. General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses: G&A expenses were $6.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $6.6 million during the same period in 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a $0.3 million increase in payroll and personnel expenses. Net Loss: Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $30.5 million, or a net loss of $0.34 per basic and diluted share, including non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $6.8 million, as compared to a net loss of $49.9 million, or a net loss of $1.16 per basic and diluted share, including non-cash goodwill impairment expense of $19.5 million and non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $5.6 million during the same period in 2023. Cash Position: Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in treasury securities were $202.1 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $159.7 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company expects that current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of September 30, 2024, will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses into the second half of 2026.

Deliver On Growth Plans? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 2:33 PM 3 min read In This Article: ACET +1.41% There's no doubt that money can be made by owning shares of unprofitable businesses. For example, although Amazon.com made losses for many years after listing, if you had bought and held the shares since 1999, you would have made a fortune. But the harsh reality is that very many loss making companies burn through all their cash and go bankrupt. So should Adicet Bio ( NASDAQ:ACET ) shareholders be worried about its cash burn? For the purposes of this article, cash burn is the annual rate at which an unprofitable company spends cash to fund its growth; its negative free cash flow. We'll start by comparing its cash burn with its cash reserves in order to calculate its cash runway. Check out our latest analysis for Adicet Bio When Might Adicet Bio Run Out Of Money? A company's cash runway is the amount of time it would take to burn through its cash reserves at its current cash burn rate. As at September 2024, Adicet Bio had cash of US$202m and no debt. Looking at the last year, the company burnt through US$93m. That means it had a cash runway of about 2.2 years as of September 2024. Importantly, analysts think that Adicet Bio will reach cashflow breakeven in 3 years. Essentially, that means the company will either reduce its cash burn, or else require more cash. You can see how its cash balance has changed over time in the image below. NasdaqGM:ACET Debt to Equity History November 18th 2024 How Is Adicet Bio's Cash Burn Changing Over Time? Because Adicet Bio isn't currently generating revenue, we consider it an early-stage business. Nonetheless, we can still examine its cash burn trajectory as part of our assessment of its cash burn situation. With cash burn dropping by 7.1% it seems management feel the company is spending enough to advance its business plans at an appropriate pace. While the past is always worth studying, it is the future that matters most of all. So you might want to take a peek at how much the company is expected to grow in the next few years . How Easily Can Adicet Bio Raise Cash? While Adicet Bio is showing a solid reduction in its cash burn, it's still worth considering how easily it could raise more cash, even just to fuel faster growth. Companies can raise capital through either debt or equity. Commonly, a business will sell new shares in itself to raise cash and drive growth. We can compare a company's cash burn to its market capitalisation to get a sense for how many new shares a company would have to issue to fund one year's operations. Adicet Bio's cash burn of US$93m is about 119% of its US$78m market capitalisation. Given just how high that expenditure is, relative to the company's market value, we think there's an elevated risk of funding distress, and we would be very nervous about holding the stock. Story Continues Is Adicet Bio's Cash Burn A Worry? Even though its cash burn relative to its market cap makes us a little nervous, we are compelled to mention that we thought Adicet Bio's cash runway was relatively promising. Shareholders can take heart from the fact that analysts are forecasting it will reach breakeven. Looking at the factors mentioned in this short report, we do think that its cash burn is a bit risky, and it does make us slightly nervous about the stock. On another note, Adicet Bio has 4 warning signs (and 2 which shouldn't be ignored) we think you should know about.

Phase 1 Clinical Trial in Metastatic/Advanced Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma Business Wire Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 12:00 AM 6 min read In This Article: ACET +1.41% First gamma delta CAR T cell therapy with the potential to address solid tumors entering clinical trials Preliminary Phase 1 clinical data expected in the first half of 2025 REDWOOD CITY, Calif. & BOSTON, November 18, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Adicet Bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: ACET), a clinical stage biotechnology company discovering and developing allogeneic gamma delta T cell therapies for autoimmune diseases and cancer, today announced the opening of enrollment for the Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating ADI-270 in patients with metastatic/advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). \"Solid tumors represent one of the highest unmet medical needs in oncology and have yet to benefit from the breakthroughs observed with CAR T cell therapies in hematologic malignancies. Emerging data from ADI-270, our armored allogeneic 'off the shelf' gamma delta 1 CAR T cell therapy targeting CD70 positive cancers, have shown potential in addressing this gap,\" said Chen Schor, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"At the recent ASGCT conference, we presented preclinical data in which ADI-270 demonstrated significant tumor infiltration, resistance to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and potent activity via CAR and innate-mediated targeting, highlighting its potential for treating solid tumors. We look forward to enrolling patients and anticipate sharing preliminary clinical data from the trial in the first half of 2025.\" About the Phase 1 Trial The Phase 1 multicenter, open-label clinical trial is designed to investigate ADI-270 as monotherapy in adults with relapsed or refractory ccRCC. Following lymphodepletion, patients will be eligible to receive a single dose of ADI-270 with a starting dose level of 3E8 CAR+ cells. Subject to meeting protocol defined criteria, patients enrolled in the trial may be eligible to receive a second dose of ADI-270. The dose escalation and dose expansion portions of the trial will evaluate safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics as well as anti-tumor activity as assessed by overall response rate, duration of response and disease control rate. About ADI-270 ADI-270 is an armored allogeneic \"off-the-shelf\" gamma delta CAR T cell therapy candidate targeting CD70-positive cancers. CD70 is a compelling target due to its high expression in both solid and hematological malignancies. ADI-270 is engineered with a third-generation CAR designed to target CD70 using its natural receptor, CD27, as the binding moiety and is further armored with a dominant negative form of the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 receptor II (dnTGF\u03b2RII) to provide functional resilience to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. ADI-270 is also designed to increase exposure and persistence by reducing susceptibility to host vs. graft elimination. These properties of ADI-270 combined with the potent tumor infiltration demonstrated with gamma delta 1 T cells aim to improve clinical responses of RCC patients and other patients with CD70+ tumors. Story Continues About Renal Cell Carcinoma Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common tumor of the kidney, constituting 80% to 85% of primary renal neoplasms. Clear cell RCCs (ccRCC) are the most common subtype, accounting for 80% of all RCCs. ccRCC is an aggressive subtype arising from renal stem cells commonly arising in the proximal nephron and tubular epithelium, and often metastasizes to the lungs, liver, and bones. Approximately 20% of newly diagnosed cases of RCC are locally advanced or metastatic and up to 30% of patients will develop metastatic disease following nephrectomy. While the 5-year survival rate for localized RCC is 93%, the 5-year survival rate for advanced disease is 15%. About Adicet Bio, Inc.

Nephritis Patient Dosed in Phase 1 Clinical Trial of ADI-001 in Autoimmune Diseases Business Wire Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 3:00 PM 5 min read In This Article: ACET +1.41% Enrollment underway for lupus nephritis (LN) patients Preliminary clinical data in LN anticipated in 1H25 Initiation of patient enrollment in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) and stiff person syndrome (SPS) expected in 1Q25; patient enrollment in anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) associated vasculitis (AAV) expected in 2H25 REDWOOD CITY, Calif. & BOSTON, November 18, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Adicet Bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: ACET), a clinical stage biotechnology company discovering and developing allogeneic gamma delta T cell therapies for autoimmune diseases and cancer, today announced that the first LN patient has been dosed in the Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating ADI-001 in autoimmune diseases. \"Dosing the first lupus nephritis patient in our Phase 1 trial of ADI-001 marks an important step forward in our mission of improving the lives of patients affected by autoimmune diseases, particularly lupus nephritis,\" said Francesco Galimi, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Adicet Bio. \"With clinical biomarker data from our study in non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma demonstrating robust tissue trafficking and complete CD19+ B cell depletion in peripheral blood and secondary lymphoid tissue, ADI-001 has the potential to be a transformative off-the-shelf treatment option for several autoimmune diseases. Additionally, the FDA\u2019s Fast Track Designation to ADI-001 in relapsed/refractory class III or class IV LN and the clearance of our investigational IND amendment application of ADI-001 for the treatment of SPS and IIM further serves to emphasize the broad and urgent unmet need for approved therapies to address autoimmune diseases.\" Dr. Galimi continued, \"With clinical sites open for enrollment and additional sites that are expected to open in the near future, we anticipate sharing preliminary clinical data from the trial in the first half of 2025. In addition, we look forward to initiating enrollment for SLE, SSc, IIM, and SPS patients in the first quarter of 2025 and for AAV patients in the second half of 2025.\" About ADI-001 ADI-001 is an investigational allogeneic gamma delta CAR T cell therapy targeting B-cells via an anti-CD20 CAR. ADI-001 was granted Fast Track Designation by the FDA for the potential treatment of relapsed/refractory class III or class IV lupus nephritis. About the Phase 1 Trial The Phase 1 study has four separate arms, enrolling LN and SLE patients into one arm, SSc patients into a second arm, IIM and SPS patients in a third arm and AAV patients into a fourth arm. Enrolled patients will receive a single dose of ADI-001. The dose-limiting toxicity window is 28 days with response and safety assessments conducted on Day 28 and during the follow up period on months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24. The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ADI-001. Secondary objectives include measuring cellular kinetics, pharmacodynamics, changes in autoantibody titers, and appropriate disease activity scores in each indication.

anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) REDWOOD CITY, Calif. & BOSTON, November 16, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Adicet Bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: ACET), a clinical stage biotechnology company discovering and developing allogeneic, gamma delta T cell therapies for autoimmune diseases and cancer, today announced that clinical biomarker data from the ADI-001 Phase 1 GLEAN trial which demonstrates robust tissue homing, significant CAR T cell activation, and complete CD19+ B cell depletion in secondary lymphoid tissue will be featured in an oral session at ACR Convergence 2024 in Washington, D.C., November 14-19. \"We believe the key to advancing care for autoimmune patients is to develop a therapeutic candidate that demonstrates robust tissue homing, complete CD19+ B cell depletion in tissue, and superior drug exposure in secondary lymphoid tissue with a positive safety profile. We are proud to share data and analyses, including clinical biomarker data, at ACR that support the potential of ADI-001 in autoimmune diseases,\" said Francesco Galimi, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer. \"After activating clinical trial sites for LN and receiving investigational new drug application (IND) clearances to pursue additional autoimmune indications, we are committed to advancing ADI-001 in a basket study across six autoimmune indications. This strategy highlights our focus on addressing the significant unmet medical needs of patients who urgently require innovative and effective new treatment options.\" A summary of the results is reported below: ADI-001 demonstrated significant levels of CAR T cell activation and tissue exposure in lymph node biopsies in the GLEAN trial, representing a range of 27-64% of total cellular material detected by ddPCR in evaluable biopsies at the 1E9 dose, and exceeding levels previously reported for patients who received autologous alpha-beta CAR T therapies. CAR T cells detected in tissues also demonstrated a robust activation profile, based on in situ levels of granzyme B. Recently published studies have demonstrated depletion of CD19+ plasmablasts, memory B cells and na\u00efve B cells in peripheral blood using anti-CD20 targeted antibodies, however, these CD20-targeted antibody modalities failed to fully deplete B cells within secondary lymphoid tissue. Concurrent with ADI-001 tissue trafficking and activation, complete depletion of CD19+ B cells within analyzed lymph node tissue was also observed. These results support ADI-001\u2019s potential for achieving complete B-cell depletion in peripheral blood and within tissues. Story Continues Details of the oral presentation Title: ADI-001: An Allogeneic CD20-targeted \u03b3\u03b4 CAR T Cell Therapy with Potential for Improved Tissue Homing in Autoimmune Indications Session Name: Abstracts: Miscellaneous Rheumatic & Inflammatory Diseases II Abstract Number: 1866169 Presenting Author: Monica Moreno, Ph.D. Date and Time: November 19, 2024; 12:00 p.m. \u2013 12:15 p.m. ET About ADI-001 in Autoimmune Diseases ADI-001 is an investigational allogeneic gamma delta CAR T cell therapy targeting B-cells via an anti-CD20 CAR. ADI-001 was granted Fast Track Designation by the FDA for the potential treatment of relapsed/refractory class III or class IV lupus nephritis (LN). Adicet is exploring the potential of ADI-001 in a basket study across six indications including lupus nephritis (LN), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM), stiff person syndrome (SPS) and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV). For more information about becoming a study site, please email clinicaltrials@adicetbio.com or visit https://www.adicetbio.com/hcp/autoimmune/ . About the Phase 1 Clinical Trial The Phase 1 study has four separate arms, enrolling LN and SLE patients into one arm, SSc patients into a second arm, IIM and SPS patients in a third arm and AAV patients into a fourth arm. Enrolled patients will receive a single dose of ADI-001. The dose-limiting toxicity window is 28 days with response and safety assessments conducted on Day 28 and during the follow-up period on months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24. The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ADI-001. Secondary objectives include measuring cellular kinetics, pharmacodynamics, changes in autoantibody titers, and appropriate disease activity scores in each indication. About Adicet Bio, Inc.

MONTR\u00c9AL , Nov. 12, 2024 /CNW/ - Canada\u00a0Economic\u00a0Development for\u00a0Quebec\u00a0Regions (CED) Supporting organizations, including business incubators and accelerators, play a key role in creating and developing innovative start-ups in Quebec . They\u00a0assist these businesses through all stages of their development and act as drivers of innovation enabling them to generate concrete economic impacts across Quebec . That is why the Honourable Soraya Martinez\u00a0Ferrada, Minister of\u00a0Tourism and Minister responsible for CED, today announced $16M in non\u200d-\u200drepayable contributions for 13\u00a0organizations selected following a call for proposals. CED is thereby renewing its funding approach to ensure the success of start\u200d-\u200dups in Quebec's different regions, whether they be in technology or the result of efforts to innovate, including impact businesses.

By boosting these Quebec organizations offering incubation and acceleration services, CED aims to maximize the scope of its support by fostering concrete impacts in all regions, including by strengthening networking in the ecosystem and by improving access to services for innovative businesses starting up across Quebec . The\u00a0chosen organizations have also committed to working with other regional players to meet local needs. Further details on the financial support are available in the related\u00a0backgrounder . The Government of Canada recognizes and supports businesses and organizations that are a\u00a0source of pride in their communities. Quebec's economic growth relies on organizations with strong roots in the regional economy; they are key assets in building a sustainable, inclusive economy.

That is why I am delighted with this new support from CED for 13\u00a0Quebec organizations offering incubation and acceleration services. Initiatives such as this one generate major economic spin-offs in the different regions and have a direct impact on communities, while also focusing on a greener economy. Emerging businesses are key assets in building an economy that is stronger, more resilient, more sustainable and more inclusive. By mobilizing together, we will enable them to reach their full potential.\" Story Continues The\u00a0Honourable Soraya\u00a0Martinez\u00a0Ferrada, Member of Parliament for Hochelaga, Minister\u00a0of\u00a0Tourism\u00a0and Minister\u00a0responsible\u00a0for\u00a0CED Quick facts The funds have been provided under\u00a0CED's Regional Economic Growth through Innovation program. This program targets entrepreneurs leveraging innovation to grow their businesses and enhance their competitiveness, as well as regional economic stakeholders helping to create an entrepreneurial environment conducive to innovation and growth for all, across all\u00a0regions. Quebec's business incubator and accelerator ecosystem is thriving; it is essential for businesses in all regions to have access to the expertise they need to succeed in order to maximize regional economic spin-offs. CED supports Quebec's business incubators and accelerators through its regular programs. To maximize the regional impact of its actions, CED launched a call for proposals to select organizations offering business incubation and acceleration services that would attain the\u00a0targeted results with regard to regional accessibility. The chosen organizations will be able to\u00a0receive the funding announced over the next four years (2024-2028). The funding announced today is conditional on the signing of a contribution agreement between the organizations and\u00a0CED. CED is the key federal partner in Quebec's regional economic development. With its 12\u00a0regional business offices, CED accompanies businesses, supporting organizations and all regions across Quebec into tomorrow's economy.
