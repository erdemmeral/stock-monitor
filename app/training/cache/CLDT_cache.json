{"text": "Chatham Lodging (CLDT) Q3 FFO Meet Estimates Zacks Equity Research Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 3:45 PM 3 min read In This Article: CLDT HPP Chatham Lodging (CLDT) came out with quarterly funds from operations (FFO) of $0.35 per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This compares to FFO of $0.40 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. A quarter ago, it was expected that this real estate investment trust would post FFO of $0.36 per share when it actually produced FFO of $0.39, delivering a surprise of 8.33%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates three times. Chatham Lodging , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry, posted revenues of $87.18 million for the quarter ended September 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.52%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $86.74 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Chatham Lodging shares have lost about 21.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 24.3%. What's Next for Chatham Lodging? While Chatham Lodging has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Chatham Lodging: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Release Date: November 07, 2024 For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript . Positive Points Chatham Lodging Trust ( NYSE:CLDT ) has entered into contracts to sell five hotels, expected to generate approximately $80 million in proceeds, which will be used to pay down debt and make additional investments. The company reported strong liquidity with the lowest leverage levels in over a decade and only $30 million of debt maturing over the next year. RevPAR growth continues to exceed industry and peer performance, with a 2.1% increase excluding renovation impacts, compared to the industry's 0.9% growth. Chatham Lodging Trust ( NYSE:CLDT ) achieved strong GOP margins of 45% and hotel EBITDA margins of 37.1% in Q3 2024. The company is well-positioned to benefit from declining interest rates, with significant exposure to floating rate debt, potentially increasing FFO by $2.6 million for every 100 basis points decline in rates. Negative Points Five hotels being sold are among the lowest RevPAR performers in the portfolio, indicating potential challenges in maintaining overall portfolio performance. Despite improvements, the recovery of the five tech-driven hotels in Silicon Valley and Bellevue has been sluggish, impacting overall performance. Benefit costs increased by 18% in the quarter, adversely impacting margins by approximately 60 basis points. Insurance costs have risen by 20% year-over-year, impacting margins by another 20 basis points. Utility costs have increased, adversely impacting margins by 20 basis points, indicating ongoing operational cost pressures. Story Continues Q & A Highlights Q : RevPAR sequentially improved in September and into October relative to earlier in the quarter. Is this a shift in demand or a continuation of steady improvement? A : Jeffrey H. Fisher, CEO & President: It's more about the end of the leisure summer component and a return to business travel post-summer. September and October are typically times to get back to work, leading to a pickup in corporate demand. Q : What is your target leverage, and how are you thinking about asset sales given the current demand environment and solid balance sheet? A : Jeremy Wegner, VP & CFO: We aim for a leverage range of 4.75 to 5.25 times, slightly above our current level. Jeffrey H. Fisher, CEO & President: We are focused on recycling capital, selling assets to enhance growth, and looking at opportunities to acquire newer assets to lower ongoing capital requirements and increase free cash flow. Q : Can you discuss the current market conditions in terms of volume and pricing for asset sales? A : Jeffrey H. Fisher, CEO & President: There hasn't been much dramatic change, but there is increased activity and interest from brokers and sellers testing the market, indicating potential opportunities. Q : Given the improving demand environment, is there anything specific you need to see to accelerate acquisitions? A : Jeffrey H. Fisher, CEO & President: We are actively looking at opportunities and expect more favorable conditions in 2025. Our focus is on enhancing internal growth, reducing capital requirements, and lowering the portfolio's average age. Q : How are you managing the balance between asset sales and acquisitions in the current market? A : Jeffrey H. Fisher, CEO & President: We are committed to recycling capital by selling older assets and reinvesting in newer properties to improve portfolio quality and growth potential, while maintaining a solid balance sheet.

Results Business Wire Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 2:30 PM 14 min read In This Article: CLDT CLDT-PA RevPAR Growth Accelerates in September and October WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., November 07, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Chatham Lodging Trust (NYSE: CLDT), a lodging real estate investment trust (REIT) that invests in upscale, extended-stay hotels and premium-branded, select-service hotels, today announced results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. Third Quarter 2024 Operating Results Portfolio Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR) \u2013 Generated RevPAR growth of 2.1 percent excluding hotels under renovation during the 2024 and 2023 third quarters, as well as the Home2 Phoenix Downtown that opened in January 2024. RevPAR increased 1.3 percent to $150 compared to the 2023 third quarter for the 38 comparable hotels. Average daily rate (ADR) was up 1.3 percent to $188, and occupancy was flat at 80 percent. RevPAR for the Silicon Valley and Bellevue hotels was up 8 percent over the 2023 third quarter. October RevPAR accelerated 6 percent over 2023 to $158, the second highest October RevPAR since Chatham's inception. Net Income \u2013 Produced net income of $4.3 million compared to net income of $7.5 million in the 2023 third quarter. Net income per diluted common share was $0.05 versus $0.11 during the 2023 third quarter. Hotel EBITDA Margin \u2013 Generated margins of 37 percent in the 2024 third quarter compared to 2023 second quarter margins of 38 percent. Adjusted EBITDA \u2013 Produced third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $29.6 million versus $30.6 in 2023. Adjusted FFO \u2013 Earned adjusted FFO of $17.6 million in the 2024 third quarter compared to $20.2 million in the 2023 third quarter. Adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.35 in 2024 and $0.40 in 2023. Asset Recycling \u2013 Entered into separate agreements to sell five hotels with an average age of 23 years, forecast 2024 RevPAR of $101 (among the six lowest RevPAR hotels in the portfolio) and due for renovation in the next 24 months. The transactions, if closed, will generate net proceeds of approximately $80 million, with funds being used initially to reduce debt. The following chart summarizes the consolidated financial results for the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, based on all properties owned during those periods ($ in millions, except margin percentages and per share data): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income (loss) to common shareholders $2.3 $5.3 $(0.1) $5.7 Diluted net income (loss) per common share $0.05 $0.11 $\u2014 $0.11 GOP Margin 44.5% 44.9% 43.4% 44.7% Hotel EBITDA Margin 37.1% 37.9% 36.0% 37.1% Adjusted EBITDA $29.6 $30.6 $79.8 $80.2 AFFO $17.6 $20.2 $45.5 $49.8 AFFO per diluted share $0.35 $0.40 $0.89 $0.99 Dividends per common share $0.07 $0.07 $0.21 $0.21 Jeffrey H. Fisher, Chatham's president and chief executive officer, commented, \"It\u2019s been a productive quarter delivering RevPAR growth of over 2 percent, meeting consensus estimates of $0.35 per share and progressing on our capital recycling initiative. We currently have five hotels under contract to be sold which would result in net proceeds of approximately $80 million if the transactions close.\" Story Continues Hotel RevPAR Performance The below chart summarizes key hotel financial statistics for the 38 comparable hotels owned as of September 30, 2024, compared to the 2023 and 2019 second quarters: Q3 2024 RevPAR Q3 2023 RevPAR Q3 2019 RevPAR Occupancy 80% 80% 85% ADR $188 $185 $176 RevPAR $150 $148 $150 The below chart summarizes RevPAR statistics by month for Chatham's comparable hotels: July August September October Occupancy \u2013 2024 81% 79% 80% 83% ADR \u2013 2024 $192 $182 $189 $191 RevPAR \u2013 2024 $155 $144 $151 $158 RevPAR \u2013 2023 $154 $143 $146 $148 % Change in RevPAR vs. prior year \u2014% \u2014% 3% 6% Fisher highlighted, \"We were very pleased with our same-store RevPAR growth of 2.1 percent after excluding hotels under renovation, far surpassing industry wide RevPAR growth of less than 0.9 percent. Our five technology dependent hotels in Silicon Valley and Bellevue produced strong RevPAR growth of 8 percent in the quarter, and growth surged to 14 percent in October at these same five hotels as we continue to benefit from surging tech demand. \"Fundamentals in our markets remain strong, as July and August market RevPAR grew 2 percent, and we closed out the quarter with September RevPAR growth of 3 percent and strong growth of 6 percent in October. Monthly RevPAR in September and October of $151 and $158 represents the second highest monthly RevPAR since our inception for each of those respective months. Business travel demand, our most important segment, continues to gain momentum as we experienced broad gains across our portfolio. Within our leisure market hotels, RevPAR rose slightly when we exclude our Savannah hotel that was under renovation for a portion of August and September,\" Fisher concluded. RevPAR performance for Chatham\u2019s largest markets comprise 71 percent of trailing twelve-month hotel EBITDA (based on EBITDA contribution over the last twelve months) is presented below: % of LTM EBITDA Q3 2024 RevPAR Change vs. Q3 2023 Q3 2023 RevPAR Q3 2019 RevPAR 38 - Hotel Portfolio $150 1% $148 $150 Silicon Valley 14% $148 8% $137 $205 Coastal Northeast 9% $264 4% $253 $225 Los Angeles 9% $175 (4)% $181 $174 Washington, D.C. 8% $153 6% $144 $152 Greater New York 8% $182 2% $178 $153 San Diego 7% $216 5% $206 $185 Dallas 6% $86 (11)% $97 $86 Austin 5% $121 5% $115 $125 Seattle 5% $184 7% $172 $188 Within Dallas, the Courtyard by Marriott Addison was under renovation for most of the quarter. \"Continuing a noteworthy trend, our primarily tech-driven hotels in Silicon Valley and Bellevue led the way with combined RevPAR growth of 8 percent in the quarter, driven by a 3 percent gain in occupancy and a 5 percent gain in ADR. Occupancy reached 78 percent in the quarter, and ADR reached $199,\" highlighted Dennis Craven, Chatham's chief operating officer. \"Excluding Silicon Valley and Bellevue, second quarter RevPAR of $148 exceeds 2019 RevPAR of $138. \"A great indicator for our portfolio is that seven of our top nine markets produced RevPAR growth, highlighting the broad growth we are experiencing. Washington, D.C., Greater New York, San Diego, Austin and Seattle are benefitting from primarily business travel demand. Our Coastal Northeast primarily leisure portfolio bucked the trends of most leisure markets and continued to see RevPAR grow.\" Approximately 65 percent of Chatham\u2019s hotel EBITDA over the last twelve months was generated from its extended-stay hotels, the highest concentration of extended-stay rooms of any public lodging REIT. Third quarter 2024 occupancy, ADR and RevPAR for each of Chatham\u2019s major brands is presented below (number of hotels in parentheses): Residence Inn (16) Homewood Suites (6) Courtyard (4) Hampton Inn (3) HGI (3) % of LTM EBITDA 49% 10% 9% 8% 6% Occupancy \u2013 2024 82% 78% 63% 93% 85% ADR \u2013 2024 $198 $149 $143 $238 $240 RevPAR \u2013 2024 $163 $116 $90 $220 $204 RevPAR \u2013 2023 $155 $122 $89 $205 $207 % Change in RevPAR 5% (4)% 1% 8% (2)% Hotel Operations Performance The below chart summarizes key hotel operating performance measures for the three-months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. Gross operating profit is calculated as hotel EBITDA plus property taxes, ground rent and insurance (in millions, except for RevPAR and margin percentages): Q3 2024 Q3 2023 RevPAR $150 $148 Gross operating profit $38.7 $38.8 Hotel EBITDA $32.2 $32.8 GOP margin 44% 45% Hotel EBITDA margin 37% 38% Craven concluded, \"For our 38 same-store hotels, our GOP margins only declined 40 basis points compared to the 2023 third quarter, encouraging given RevPAR growth of 1 percent. The main driver of this is moderating wage pressures and an efficient workforce. Our headcount is down approximately 1 percent from year-end. Reduced labor costs actually improved margins 10 basis points year-over-year, while increased benefits-related costs adversely impacted our margins by approximately 60 basis points. Encouragingly, we are hopeful based on preliminary estimates that employee benefits costs will be essentially flat next year for the first time in a long time.\" Corporate Update The below chart summarizes key financial performance measures for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. Corporate EBITDA is calculated as hotel EBITDA minus cash corporate general and administrative expenses and is before debt service and capital expenditures. Debt service includes interest expense and principal amortization on its secured debt, as well as dividends on its preferred shares of $2.0 million per quarter. Cash flow before CapEx and common dividends is calculated as corporate EBITDA less debt service and preferred share dividends. Amounts are in millions, except RevPAR. Q3 2024 Q3 2023 RevPAR $150 $148 Hotel EBITDA $32.2 $32.8 Corporate EBITDA $29.6 $30.6 Debt Service & Preferred dividends $(10.2) $(10.1) Cash flow before CapEx and Common dividends $19.4 $20.5 Capital Markets & Capital Structure As of September 30, 2024, Chatham had net debt of $419 million (total consolidated debt less unrestricted cash). Total debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024, was $439 million at an average interest rate of 6.8 percent, comprised of $174 million of fixed-rate mortgage debt at an average interest rate of 6.7 percent, $140 million outstanding on its term loan at a rate of 6.9 percent and $125 million outstanding on the company's $260 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility at a rate of 6.9 percent. Based on the ratio of Chatham\u2019s net debt to hotel investments at cost, the company's leverage ratio was approximately 24 percent. \"With only $30 million of maturing debt over the next year, leverage at our lowest levels in over a decade and proceeds from the sale of five hotels of approximately $80 million, we are well-positioned to capitalize on any meaningful opportunities that will add hotel EBITDA and FFO,\" stated Jeremy Wegner, Chatham\u2019s chief financial officer. \"Additionally, with $265 million of floating rate debt, we will benefit from an expected declining interest rate environment. Based on outstanding debt as of September 30, 2024, for every 100 basis point decline in SOFR, our AFFO per share will increase $2.6 million or $0.05 per share.\" Hotel Investments During the third quarter, the company invested capital expenditures of $6 million and approximately $25 million year-to-date. Chatham\u2019s 2024 budget is approximately $37 million. A renovation of the Courtyard Dallas Addison commenced in July and was completed in the third quarter. A renovation of the SpringHill Suites Savannah commenced in August and will be completed in the fourth quarter. A renovation of the Residence Inn Bellevue, Wash., will commence in the fourth quarter and be completed in the 2025 first quarter. Additionally, the renovation of the Hilton Garden Inn Portsmouth, N.H., scheduled for early 2025, will commence in the 2024 fourth quarter. Dividend The Board of Trustees declared a preferred dividend of $0.41406 per share and a common dividend of $0.07 per share, payable October 15, 2024, to shareholders of record on September 30, 2024. 2024 Fourth Quarter Guidance Chatham\u2019s 2024 fourth quarter guidance reflects the following assumptions: Renovations of three hotels Repayment of a $14 million maturing mortgage in December No additional acquisitions, dispositions, debt or equity issuance Q4 2024 RevPAR $124 - $127 RevPAR growth 1% to 3% Total hotel revenue $74-$75 M Net income (loss) $(6)-$(4) M Net income (loss) per diluted common share $(0.15-$(0.11) Adjusted EBITDA $19-$21 M Adjusted FFO $7-$9 M Adjusted FFO per diluted share $0.15-$0.18 Hotel EBITDA margins 30%-32% Corporate cash administrative expenses $3.3 M Corporate non-cash administrative expenses $1.5 M Interest income $0.0 M Interest expense (excluding fee amortization) $7.4 M Non-cash amortization of deferred fees $0.4 M Weighted average shares/units outstanding 51.3 M Chatham provides guidance but does not undertake to update it for any developments in its business.

About Chatham Lodging Trust Chatham Lodging Trust is a self-advised, publicly traded real estate investment trust (REIT) focused primarily on investing in upscale, extended-stay hotels and premium-branded, select-service hotels. The company owns 39 hotels totaling 5,883 rooms/suites in 17 states and the District of Columbia. Additional information about Chatham may be found at chathamlodgingtrust.com. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Included in this press release are certain \"non-GAAP financial measures,\" within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations, that are different from measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles). The company considers the following non-GAAP financial measures useful to investors as key supplemental measures of its operating performance: (1) FFO, (2) Adjusted FFO, (3) EBITDA, (4) EBITDAre, (5) Adjusted EBITDA, (6) Adjusted Hotel EBITDA, (7) Hotel EBITDA, (8) Hotel EBITDA Margin, (9) Corporate EBITDA and (10) Cash flow before CapEx and common dividends. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income or loss as prescribed by GAAP as a measure of its operating performance. FFO As Defined by Nareit and Adjusted FFO Chatham calculates FFO in accordance with standards established by the Nareit, which defines FFO as net income or loss (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate, impairment write-downs, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, plus depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures following the same approach. Chatham believes that the presentation of FFO provides useful information to investors regarding its operating performance because it measures its performance without regard to specified non-cash items such as real estate depreciation and amortization, gain or loss on sale of real estate assets and certain other items that the company believes are not indicative of the property level performance of its hotel properties. Chatham believes that these items reflect historical cost of its asset base and its acquisition and disposition activities and are less reflective of its ongoing operations, and that by adjusting to exclude the effects of these items, FFO is useful to investors in comparing its operating performance between periods and between REITs that also report using the Nareit definition. Chatham calculates Adjusted FFO by further adjusting FFO for certain additional items that are not addressed in Nareit\u2019s definition of FFO, including other charges, losses on the early extinguishment of debt and similar items related to its unconsolidated real estate entities that it believes do not represent costs related to hotel operations. Chatham believes that Adjusted FFO provides investors with another financial measure that may facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs that make similar adjustments to FFO. EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA Chatham calculates EBITDA for purposes of the credit facility debt as net income or loss excluding: (1) interest expense; (2) provision for income taxes, including income taxes applicable to sale of assets; (3) depreciation and amortization; and (4) unconsolidated real estate entity items including interest, depreciation and amortization excluding gains and losses from sales of real estate. Chatham believes EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating and facilitating comparisons of its operating performance because it helps investors compare Chatham's operating performance between periods and between REITs by removing the impact of its capital structure (primarily interest expense) and asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from its operating results. In addition, Chatham uses EBITDA as one measure in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions. Chatham calculates EBITDAre in accordance with Nareit guidelines, which defines EBITDAre as net income or loss excluding interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, gains or losses from sales of real estate, impairment, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. We believe that the presentation of EBITDAre provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's operating performance and can facilitate comparisons of performance between periods and between REITs. Chatham calculates Adjusted EBITDA by further adjusting EBITDA for certain additional items, including other charges, losses on the early extinguishment of debt, amortization of non-cash share-based compensation and similar items related to its unconsolidated real estate entities, which it believes are not indicative of the performance of its underlying hotel properties entities. Chatham believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with another financial measure that may facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs that report similar measures. Adjusted Hotel EBITDA is defined as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, corporate general and administrative, impairment loss, loss on early extinguishment of debt, interest and other income and income or loss from unconsolidated real estate entities. Chatham presents Adjusted Hotel EBITDA because Chatham believes it is useful to investors in comparing its hotel operating performance between periods and comparing its Adjusted Hotel EBITDA to those of our peer companies. Adjusted Hotel EBITDA represents the results of operations for its wholly owned hotels only . Although Chatham presents FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA because it believes they are useful to investors in comparing Chatham's operating performance between periods and between REITs that report similar measures, these measures have limitations as analytical tools. Some of these limitations are: FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA do not reflect the company\u2019s cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, Chatham\u2019s working capital needs; FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA do not reflect funds available to make cash distributions; EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements to service interest or principal payments, on Chatham\u2019s debts; Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may need future replacement, and FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; Non-cash compensation is and will remain a key element of Chatham\u2019s overall long-term incentive compensation package, although Chatham excludes it as an expense when evaluating its ongoing operating performance for a particular period using adjusted EBITDA; Adjusted FFO, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges (including acquisition transaction costs) that result from matters Chatham considers not to be indicative of the underlying performance of its hotel properties; and Other companies in Chatham\u2019s industry may calculate FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA differently than Chatham does, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure. In addition, FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA do not represent cash generated from operating activities as determined by GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or loss, cash flows from operations or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP. FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA are not measures of Chatham\u2019s liquidity. Because of these limitations, FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Chatham compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA only supplementally. Chatham\u2019s consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Chatham\u2019s reconciliation of FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA to net income attributable to common shareholders, as determined under GAAP, is set forth below.

Equity Research Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 1:35 AM 3 min read In This Article: LAND CLDT Gladstone Land (LAND) came out with quarterly funds from operations (FFO) of $0.13 per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This compares to FFO of $0.16 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of -3.08%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this real estate investment trust specializing in farmland would post FFO of $0.12 per share when it actually produced FFO of $0.10, delivering a surprise of -16.67%. Over the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus FFO estimates. Gladstone , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry, posted revenues of $22.57 million for the quarter ended September 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.11%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $23.53 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Gladstone shares have lost about 6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 21.2%. What's Next for Gladstone? While Gladstone has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Gladstone: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $0.14 on $22.06 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.52 on $84.85 million in revenues for the current fiscal year. Story Continues Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

Let me turn the session over to Jeff Fisher. Jeff. Jeffrey H. Fisher All right, thanks Chris and I certainly appreciate everyone joining us this morning for our call. We've got some good news here throughout before I get into our quarterly results. I'd like to provide an update on some key corporate initiatives that we've been undertaking. First, we've entered into separate contracts to sell five hotels and are hopeful that those transactions close in this fourth quarter. When closed will generate proceeds of approximately $80 million. The five hotels slated for closing are on average 23 years old. Among the six lowest RevPAR hotels in our portfolio have they have forecasted 2024 RevPAR of $101 and importantly are in need of renovations within the next 24 months. We will use these proceeds to initially pay down debt but ultimately make additional investments to accretively grow EBITA and FFO. This recycling initiative will enable us to continue to add hotels in new markets or expand our presence in existing markets. We will continue to look at opportunities to sell assets and reinvest in hotels that enhance our portfolio quality and growth profile. Secondly, our liquidity is strong. We are at the lowest leverage levels in over a decade. We paid off another maturing mortgage in the quarter and have a mere $30 million of debt maturing over the next year. Additionally, we've added exposure to floating rate debt and with raises expected to decline, we will be able to grow FFO in fact, based on current borrowings outstanding, our FFO increases $2.6 million or approximately $0.5 per share for every 100 basis points decline in so far. I'd like to spend a few minutes on our solid third quarter results and you'll hear more detail from Dennis. We're quite pleased to report the I and FFO near the top of our guidance range. Importantly, our RevPAR growth continues to exceed industry and most peer performance. Our RevPAR growth of 2.1% when you take without the impact of renovations handily beat industry growth of 0.9%. We were able to deliver even an FFO at the upper end of our guidance range because our operating expenses were at the lower end of our expectations. We were able to limit our same store GOP margin decline to only 40 basis points. And as we've said, in the last few quarters, employment and wage pressures are moderating with year over year wages up only 3% well below what has been experienced over the last five years. And our absolute GOP margins of 45% are strong. I think if you step back, what you really see here is the complete cycle change from the post COVID environment. And I believe as you look forward for the industry and specifically for us, you will see those margins pop back up to some pretty strong levels. Third quarter, RevPAR of $150 exceeded 2019 levels. Marking the second consecutive quarter beating 2019 levels. And based on our current guidance, full year, 2024 RevPAR should exceed 2019 levels for the first time since the pandemic. As most most understand the sluggish recovery in our five tech driven hotels in Silicon Valley and Bellevue have caused us to lag 2019 levels up till now. But we are moving ahead. If you pull out the five tech driven hotels, RevPAR of $148 is up 7% compared compared to 2019. With ADR up a strong 14% in occupancy up 6%. Of course, mostly attributable to Silicon Valley. Let's talk about our five tech driven hotels in Silicon Valley and Bellevue which achieved third quarter red Park growth of 8% in the quarter and a whopping 14% in October in the quarter. ADR rose 5% to almost $200 and occupancy rose 3% to almost 79%. We're really encouraged by the demand dynamics we're seeing in the markets. And as we've spoken quite a bit over the last few quarters, a lot of good things are happening in the market related to AI computer chip initiatives and re-office efforts by most of the big tech companies announcing the return to office that we've been waiting for. To give you some additional color on what's happening. Just a week ago in Sunnyvale, our largest individual market with just about 500 rooms there. It was announced that Sunnyvale was selected as the site for the new Chips for America design and collaboration facility. The facility will be one of the flagship R&D facilities for the Chips for America initiative. Last month, applied materials acquired another site less than half a mile from our Sunnyvale to residents in for about $100 million. The plans for that side have not been announced but certainly will be beneficial to our hotel and applied materials. Forever has been one of our top five accounts. Applied materials previously announced $4 billion, 180,000 square foot R&D facility is expected to break ground shortly and I know we're already doing business with folks involved in that facilities' construction, whether they're consultants, architects or otherwise. As a reminder, this facility sits about a mile from our two hotels. Within the last quarter. General Motors opened in Mountain View, a technical center to be a focal point for software development and innovation it's located right in Silicon Valley. And of course, we do have a residence inn right in mountain view and it's certainly going to be beneficial overall to our hotel and the market, as previously mentioned, intuitive Surgical, another one of our largest corporate clients in Sunnyvale is also expanding its footprint, building, another 1 million square feet of office and R&D industrial construction obviously has resumed and we are pleased with what we see going forward. Looking across the remainder of the portfolio business travel continues its steady growth across the country and that certainly was proven out again this quarter for us with seven of our largest nine markets delivering RevPAR growth in the quarter. Our occupancy for the key weekday business travel days was 79% on Monday, 84% on Tuesday and Wednesday and 79% on Thursday. All but Thursday up over last year, weekday ADR was up 2% in the quarter to $186. And weekend ADR was down 1%. Just to finish up here. In conclusion, we remain encouraged by the fact that our repvar growth continues to outperform the industry in most peers and we still have the most internal growth upside as we look forward of other lodging reads. Given the recovery still available in those five tech hotels. Additionally, expense pressures, as I've said, have certainly lessened labor and benefit wages costs seem to be under control. And by that, I mean, reverting back to more historical normal increases that we've experienced over the last five years. And we're hopeful that enables us to drive margins higher. Finally, on the balance sheet side, we are in excellent financial condition and we're positioned to meaningfully benefit from declining interest rates. And we've got the capacity and flexibility to continue to recycle capital, acquire hotels where they can really be accreted to FFO our earnings. And nav with that, I'd like to turn it over to Dennis. Story Continues Dennis M. Craven Thanks Jeff. Good morning, everyone. RevPAR And our seven predominantly leisure hotels, which comprises approximately 20% of our third quarter. Room revenue saw RevPAR rise 0.7% and that does exclude the impact of the Savannah Hotel that was under renovation for August and September and within our leisure hotels. Our best performer was the Hampton Inn. Portland Maine with RevPAR growth of 8% in the quarter. Our top five RevPAR hotels in the quarter were dominated by our three Northeastern assets led by our Hampton in Portland Maine with RevPAR of $347. Our Hilton Garden in Portsmouth of $273 that RevPAR was down 1% year over year, followed by our residents in San Diego gas lamp at $216. Then our Hilton Garden Inn in Marina Del Rey with RevPAR of $215. And lastly, our Hampton Inn and suites, exeter new Hampshire with RevPAR of $201. Post quarter, end October Park grew 6% with occupancy of 5% to 83%. And ADR up 1% to $191. Interestingly, 30 of our 38 comparable hotels produced positive RevPAR in the month of October. So again, just really broad overall, strong trends in the portfolio in October. RevPAR the first week of November, Not surprisingly is down about 4% due to the impact obviously of the midweek election. Breaking down our Silicon Valley hotels within Silicon Valley RevPAR . Our two Sunnyvale hotels gained 13% in the quarter driven by a 5% gain in occupancy to 80% and a 7% gain in ADR $295. As Jeff discussed a lot of good things happening in the Sunnyvale market with our key corporate clients like applied materials and into it, Apple, tiktok versus 2019 these two hotels are covered slower than the other two, but the good news obviously is that they are growing faster than the rest of the portfolio. At our Mountain view Residence Inn RevPAR was up 3% in the quarter to $174. That's driven by a 7% increase in ADR to $230 and a decline in occupancy of 4% to 76%. We made the decision earlier this earlier this quarter and this summer to not take certain intern business at that hotel because they were out, they were looking at lower rated business in the market, lower rated hotel business in the market to stay. At in St. Mateo, RevPAR rose 2% to $149 with gains evenly attributable to ADR in occupancy for the second consecutive quarter. RevPAR exceeded 2019 levels at our other tech driven hotel, the residence in Bellevue, it produced strong RevPAR growth of 8% in the quarter to $184 again with an even split in ADR in occupancy, occupancy at that hotel is 85% versus 2019 3rd quarter. RevPAR is approximately 2% shy of 2019 levels. At our 38 comparable hotels, hotel EBIDTA margins were only down 40 basis points. A pretty good result given low single digit RevPAR growth moderating labor cost for the primary driver wages for Occupied room. We're only up 0.9% within our within our rooms department and we're and those are actually down 1.8% in the quarter. That decline is partly driven by increased productivity given the fact that occupancy rose while labor head count declined by 1%. Benefit costs were up 18% in the quarter and that's been a message obviously all year long and that adversely impacted margins by approximately 60 basis points. As I mentioned in our release, at least based on preliminary estimates for the first time in what seems like a really long time. We are hopeful that our benefit costs are going to be essentially flat year over year in 2025. Other key items that impacted our third quarter, 24 margins, complimentary breakfast costs were up 14% and that impacted margins by approximately 20 basis points. Insurance has been up again, kind of a consistent theme obviously with renewals on a calendar year basis, 20% year over year and that also impacted margins by 20 basis points. And the good news again, kind of on the renewal front is based on preliminary expectations is that increase is going to be kind of in the mid single digit range across both both forms of our insurance policies for our properties. Utility costs were up and that adversely impacted 20 basis points and offsetting some of those increases were lower guest acquisition costs primarily related to Lloyd of program reimbursements that improved margins by approximately 80 bps in the quarter. During the third quarter, our other operating departments profits were flat year over year. Our top five producers of GOP in the quarter were led by our gas lamp residents in with $2.9 million the 11th straight quarter. It's led our portfolio followed by our Incredible Hampton in Portland with GOP of $2.5 million, which was up approximately 10% year over year and followed by another great quarter at our residence in Bellevue with GOP increasing 15% to $2.4 million. And then rounding out the top five were our Sunnyvale two residents in and our seasonally strong Hilton Garden Inn, Portsmouth with approximately $1.6 million of GOP each. At our five tech driven hotels we generated really strong hotel GOP margins of 50% in the quarter and with GOP up approximately 6% over last year, with respect to capital expenditures, we spent $6 million in the quarter, $25 million year-to-date. Our budget for 2024 is $37 million. We do expect we're going to come in under that at about $34 million for the year. A renovation of the courtyard Dallas Addison commenced in July and was completed in the third quarter. A renovation of the Springhill Suites, Savannah commenced in August and will be completed in the fourth quarter. A renovation of the residence in Bellevue, Washington will commence in the fourth quarter quarter and be completed in the 2025 1st quarter. And additionally, the renovation at Hilton Garden in Portsmouth, New Hampshire scheduled for early 2025. We are commencing that this month to get into some slow periods and that'll commence here shortly. So with that. I'll turn it over to Jeremy. Jeremy Wegner Thanks Dennis. Good morning everyone. Chatham's Q3 2024 Hotel EBITDA was $32.2 million adjusted EBITDA was $29.6 million and adjusted FFO was $0.35 per share. We were able to generate a GOP margin of 44.5% in Hotel EBITDA margin of 37.1% in Q3. GOP margins for the quarter were only down 40 basis points from Q3, 2024 or 2023 which is strong given our Q3 RevPAR growth of 1.3%. This improvement in margin trends relative to prior quarters reflects continuing stabilization of key expenses such as labor and the fact that expense comparisons to Q3 last year were clean Unlike Q2, where expense comps were impacted by some onetime benefits In Q2 of 2023. We ended the quarter on a strong note with RevPAR up 3.4% in September and the strong top line performance has continued into the start of Q4 with October RevPAR up 6%. Over the past couple of years We have taken significant steps to reduce leverage and address debt maturities. We now have only $30 million of debt maturing over the next 12 months and have $135 million of availability under our revolving credit facility. $265 million or 60% of our debt is floating rate. So we stand to benefit significantly as rates come down. As Jeff mentioned, we are pursuing several potential asset sales and if any of these are completed, the proceeds would likely be used to repay credit facility borrowings in the near term and reinvest it into hotel investments in the medium to longer term. As of September 30th Chatham's net debt to LTM EBITDA was 4.2 times which is significantly below our prepandemic leverage, which is generally in the 5.5times to 6 times area. Our leverage ratios should continue to improve with the continuing performance recovery of our Silicon Valley hotels. Turning to our Q4 guidance, we expect RevPAR growth of 1% to 3% adjusted EBITA of $19million to $21 million and adjusted FFO per share of $0.15 to $0.18. This guidance reflects the renovations of three hotels during the quarter. So you should note that we also renovated three hotels in Q4 2023. So there is no net impact on year over year for growth. Our guidance also reflects the repayment of a $14 million mortgage loan maturing in December with available cash and credit facility borrowings and does not reflect any acquisitions dispositions or other capital markets activity. This concludes my portion of the call operator. Please open the line for questions. Question and Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions) Jonathan Jenkins, Oppenheimer & Co. Jonathan Jenkins Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter. First one for me for Jeff, revpar sequentially improved in September and into October relative to earlier in the quarter. And I'm curious if you think that's kind of a shift in demand and inflection higher in corporate demand, Post Labor Day or is it more a continuation of the steady improvement that you've seen over the course of the year? Jeffrey H. Fisher Yeah, I think what you've got is just it more or less the end of the leisure summer component that's out there. And I think what you've seen over time post COVID is business travel seems to be a lot more slack in and around holidays in and around the summer time anyway, generally. So what I like to say in the office is we're Europe or almost Europe and they all think I'm a little bit of a right winger. But anyway, that's what happens when you live in Palm Beach. So, I think that's really what you've got going on with September and October really being time to get back to work and business. And so therefore, I think what we've seen is just some corporate demand pick up. Jonathan Jenkins Okay. That's great. I appreciate the color there and then maybe switching gears. Can you remind us what your target leverage is, is that historical level kind of a good expectation going forward? And maybe can you provide some additional color on how you're thinking about the asset sales in light of a seemingly good and improving demand environment above industry trends and, and then your solid balance sheet position? I mean, is there anything in particular you would need to see to maybe step on the gas on acquisitions in the near term a little quicker. Jeremy Wegner Addressing the first part of your question with respect to leverage targets, I'd say we don't necessarily want to be all the way to where we were historically, but we're probably a little below where we would feel comfortable being now. So if we're at four and a quarter times or so now, probably, you know, four and three quarters to five and a quarter would be a reasonable range for us. Jeffrey H. Fisher And I think with regard to recycling capital, I will tell you that it is around here. Anyway, a very much of a renewed focus, you can tell because if you look at our history, we've sold assets on a onesie Twosie basis on a limited basis for us to aggressively, you know, market and be successful in, you know, listing and signing PSAs on five different hotels. I think certainly shows our desire to move some things along here a little bit and I do believe that opportunities are out there. We're looking at a few now. I think that in 2025 there'll be more just because the overall environment and capital markets I think will be more favorable in that regard, which might also, you know, cause some owners to just look at selling. I'm not going to talk about distress because that never seems to come to fruition. But I think our relationships are solid enough with folks that we buy, bought from before. I just had a call from one, we bought two from actually about three or four years ago. An opportunity just two days ago. So yes, I think that we can enhance our internal growth by newer assets, lessen our ongoing capital requirements and CapEx spend. That's the plan, create more free cash flow to distribute to shareholders and lower the average age of the portfolio. Those are the, those are really, I think doable objectives. Jonathan Jenkins Okay. That's great. And maybe a follow on to that commentary given you guys have been out in the market lately. Can you maybe talk about what you're seeing real time in terms of volume and pricing? Has there been any closing of the GAAP between buyer and seller expectations or, or any other moves as of late, given the interest rates movement since September. Jeffrey H. Fisher But there really hasn't been much dramatic. This stuff seems to have a lag time historically to it anyway. So, but yes, there's been, I know, you know, certainly from some broker, friends, etcetera. They're just doing a lot more, you know, bovs and activity in their shop for things that folks, you know, are looking to perhaps test the market with. Jonathan Jenkins Okay, great, very helpful. Thank you for all the color. That's all for me. Operator Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Okay, Looks like there's no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back to Jeff Fisher for closing remarks. Jeffrey H. Fisher Well, thank you all for being here. Once again. I think we clearly enunciated where we intend to go. And we're looking forward to posting some more good results going forward. Thank you. Operator Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.
