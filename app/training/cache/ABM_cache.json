Environmental and Facilities Services Stocks Q3 Teardown: Tetra Tech (NASDAQ:TTEK) Vs The Rest Adam Hejl Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 12:07 PM 5 min read In This Article: TTEK -7.07% ARIS +0.59% PESI -3.71% Environmental and Facilities Services Stocks Q3 Teardown: Tetra Tech (NASDAQ:TTEK) Vs The Rest The end of an earnings season can be a great time to discover new stocks and assess how companies are handling the current business environment. Let\u2019s take a look at how Tetra Tech (NASDAQ:TTEK) and the rest of the environmental and facilities services stocks fared in Q3. Many environmental and facility services are non-discretionary (sports stadiums need to be cleaned after events), recurring, and performed through longer-term contracts. This makes for more predictable and stickier revenue streams. Additionally, there has been an increasing focus on emissions and water conservation over the last decade, driving innovation in the sector and demand for new services. Despite these tailwinds, environmental and facility services companies are still at the whim of economic cycles. Interest rates, for example, can greatly impact commercial construction projects that drive incremental demand for these services. The 14 environmental and facilities services stocks we track reported a slower Q3. As a group, revenues were in line with analysts\u2019 consensus estimates while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 1.7% above. While some environmental and facilities services stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they have collectively declined. On average, share prices are down 2.9% since the latest earnings results.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Strong Momentum Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Trump's tariffs Jim Cramer Says J. M. Smucker (SJM) Can\u2019t \u2018Overrun Sentiment\u2019 Amid Weight Loss Drugs Threat Fahad Saleem Sun, Jan 26, 2025, 8:18 PM 4 min read In This Article: SJM -0.97% We recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Calls: 10 Stocks to Buy or Sell . In this article, we are going to take a look at where The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM) stands against other stocks to buy and sell highlighted in Jim Cramer's latest calls. Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC reminded viewers about the Trump playbook in the story market and said that he never believed the President would start a new trade war with China. Cramer explained that Trump\u2019s rhetoric has been \u201chot\u201d but the reality is \u201ccool\u201d and his much-feared tariffs against Canada and Mexico might also not realize as the new administration said it will \u201cstudy\u201d the matter. \u201cThe president loves the stock market; he always loves to send signals that all hell is going to break loose, and when it doesn\u2019t, well, guess what? The market flies. This rally is built on the back of tariffs, more specifically small-than-expected tariffs that could grow bigger if countries don\u2019t play ball. It\u2019s built on the backs of new projects like Stargate, a new AI infrastructure initiative.\u201d Cramer then explained in detail why he believes Biden and his government were against top companies and how it affected the market and economy. Cramer said Trump is better for stock portfolios. \u201cHe knows business people in Silicon Valley; he knows how things work. You may like him, you may hate him, but the bottom line is, if you\u2019re a tech titan, Trump will take your call. In fact, he\u2019ll call you. Biden, I don\u2019t know if he knew who they even were, and he certainly didn\u2019t bother to call them. In the end, I think he preferred to sue them. If you own stocks, which is why you watch me, Trump\u2019s method is a heck of a lot better for your portfolio.\u201d READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about during his programs on CNBC. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ( see more details here ). Jim Cramer Says J M Smucker (SJM) Can\u2019t \u2018Overrun Sentiment\u2019 Amid Weight Loss Drugs Threat A wholesaler distributing peanut butter, fruit spreads and specialty spreads to a retailer. The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE: SJM ) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 30 Jim Cramer in a latest program mentioned an analyst downgrade on The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM) and reiterated that he believes GLP-1 weight loss drugs are having an impact on investor sentiment. Story Continues \u201cThe stock is getting hurt on this. It\u2019s part of what I regard as being a reshuffling of this group. Once again, GLP-1. It does yield 4%. Very well-run company, but you can\u2019t , you can\u2019t overrun the sentiment right now. You just can\u2019t.\u201d Middle Coast Investing stated the following regarding The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM) in its Q4 2024 investor letter : \u201cI\u2019ve been interested in \u2018boring\u2019 companies that should do well whatever the market environment, and that have strong balance sheets in case things turn badly. ABM Inc. (ABM) from last quarter, Steelcase, or The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM) are examples of these types of companies. SJM has more debt on its balance sheet, but I believe its business will be stable enough for it to pay off the debt, creating more value for shareholders.\u201d Overall, SJM ranks 8th on our list of stocks to buy and sell highlighted in Jim Cramer's latest calls. While we acknowledge the potential of SJM, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SJM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock .

Regulatory bodies such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and OSHA's regulatory guidelines are also expected to create growth opportunities for market players. Key healthcare facilities outsource their environmental services to specialized vendors who enable them to meet stringent criteria. Environmental services (EVS) companies invest in R&D activities to innovate offerings, adopt green cleaning practices, expand service portfolios, and gain ISSA CIMS-GB certification to stay competitive.

CDC, EPA, and OSHA mandates for maintaining cleanliness are compelling many healthcare facilities to outsource environmental services to specialised service providers, who are progressively utilising advanced cleaning and disinfection technologies, such as UV-C disinfection systems, autonomous cleaning robots, and microfibre materials. Story Continues The healthcare environmental services market in the United States is segmented by facility type, encompassing acute-care, post-acute care, and non-acute care facilities. In 2023, acute-care facilities represented the largest share of this market. The increasing use of outsourced cleaning services aids these acute care facilities in reducing internal administrative costs such as the purchase and upkeep of different cleaning technologies and supplies. These professional environmental services (EVS) providers are skilled in advanced cleaning technologies and ensure a higher cleanliness standard, better experience for the patients, and a good HCAHPS score, which is necessary for attracting higher reimbursements. Since these scores are posted to the public, they really help to enhance the public's perception of healthcare facilities, which can only drive the trend toward healthcare facility outsourcing for environmental services.

and updates on Trump's tariffs ESQUIRE FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC. REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2024 RESULTS PR Newswire Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 4:30 PM 31 min read In This Article: ESQ -3.52% Strong Commercial Loan and Deposit Growth Nationally Drives Record Earnings for 2024 JERICHO, N.Y. , Jan. 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Esquire Financial Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: ESQ) (the \"Company\"), the financial holding company for Esquire Bank, National Association (\"Esquire Bank\" or the \"Bank\"), (collectively \"Esquire\") today announced its operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. Significant achievements and key performance metrics during the current quarter and year include: Esquire Financial Holdings (PRNewsfoto/Prosek Partners / Esquire Financial Holdings, Inc.) Net income increased 19% to $11.8 million , or $1.37 per diluted share in the current quarter, as compared to $9.9 million , or $1.18 per diluted share, for the comparable quarter in 2023. Net income for the full year increased $2.6 million , or 7%, to $43.7 million , or $5.14 per diluted share, when compared to $41.0 million , or $4.91 per diluted share, in 2023. For the full year 2023, adjusted (1) net income and diluted earnings per share were $38.1 million (an increase of $5.6 million or 15% when compared to 2024) and $4.56 , respectively, excluding the $4.0 million pre-tax gain on certain equity investments. On a linked quarter basis, net income increased $393 thousand , or 4%, to $11.8 million despite a $700 thousand increase in the provision for credit losses, primarily due to commercial law firm loan growth in the current quarter. Consistent industry leading returns on average assets and equity of 2.49% and 19.99% for the current quarter and 2.57% and 20.14% for the full year 2024, respectively, notwithstanding our continued investment in current resources for future growth. Continued expansion of our total revenue base to $124.8 million for the full year 2024 fueled by an industry leading net interest margin of 6.06% and stable fee-based income (led by our payment processing platform) totaling $24.9 million , or 20% of total revenue.\u00a0 In the current quarter, our net interest margin of 5.87% was negatively impacted by approximately 13 basis points due to elevated average interest earning cash balances that were funded with core deposit growth. Strong core deposit growth totaling $105.9 million , or 28% annualized, on a linked quarter basis to $1.63 billion , comprised of low-cost commercial relationship deposits with a cost-of-funds of 0.95% (including demand deposits). Deposit growth for the full year was $234.9 million , or 17%, when compared to 2023. Off-balance sheet sweep funds increased $276.4 million , or 99%, to $554.4 million when compared to year-end 2023, with approximately 77% available for additional on-balance sheet liquidity, while the associated administrative service payments (\"ASP\") fee income totaled $714 thousand for the current quarter. Additional available liquidity totaled approximately $907 million , excluding cash and unsecured borrowing capacity. Significant loan growth on a linked quarter basis totaling $99.6 million , or 31% annualized, to $1.40 billion . Growth was fueled by a $95.1 million or a 46% annualized increase in higher yielding commercial loans nationally, led by net draws on existing commercial litigation related loans. For the full year 2024, loans grew $189.6 million , or 16%, when compared to $1.21 billion in 2023 with commercial loan growth totaling $182.7 million or 25% (litigation related loans grew $223.4 million , or 37%, in 2024). These commercial loans have and will continue to create additional opportunities for future core deposit growth (noninterest bearing operating or DDA and escrow or IOLTA accounts nationally) through our full service commercial relationship banking programs and our branchless commercial cash management platform. Interest earning asset growth, excluding cash and cash equivalents, was $127.7 million , or 32% annualized, on a linked quarter basis and totaled $1.71 billion . In early 2024, management elected to temper multifamily and commercial real estate loan growth in response to the economic environment and has ratably purchased short duration agency mortgage-backed securities with commensurate risk adjusted yields, enhancing our liquidity while improving the securities to total assets ratio to 17%. Interest earning asset growth, excluding cash and cash equivalents, for the full year was $301.0 million , or 21%, when compared to 2023. Solid credit metrics, asset quality, and reserve coverage ratios with an allowance for credit losses to loans ratio of 1.50% and a nonperforming loan to total assets ratio of 0.58%, represented by one multifamily loan totaling $10.9 million . We have no exposure to commercial office space, no construction loans, and only $14.7 million in performing loans to the hospitality industry. Stable and consistent fee income in the current quarter totaling $6.2 million , or 19% of total revenue, led by our payment processing platform with 88,000 small business clients nationally. Our technology-enabled payments platform facilitated the processing of $9.2 billion in credit and debit card payment volume across 145.7 million transactions for our clients in the current quarter. Strong efficiency ratio of 47.5% and 48.7% for the fourth quarter and full year ended 2024, respectively, notwithstanding our investments in resources to support future growth and excellence in client service. Strong capital foundation with common equity tier 1 (\"CET1\") and tangible common equity to tangible asset (1) (\"TCE/TA\") ratios of 14.67% and 12.53%, respectively. Including the after-tax unrealized losses on both the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolios of $14.3 million and $5.6 million , respectively, the adjusted (1) CET1 and adjusted (1) TCE/TA ratios were 13.33% and 12.23%, respectively. Esquire Bank remains well above the bank regulatory \"Well Capitalized\" standards. Included on the \"2024 Fortune 100 Fastest-Growing Companies\" list based on our revenue growth, earnings per share growth and three-year annualized return to shareholders for the period ending on June 30, 2024 . Leer m\u00e1s \"Throughout 2024, our focus on creating long-term stakeholder value continued by leveraging our regional business development officers to significantly grow core deposits nationally as well as higher yielding commercial litigation or law firm loans,\" stated Tony Coelho , Chairman of the Board. \"We coupled this focus with tempering our New York metro real estate lending in response to the current market sentiment and instead invested excess cash flow from core deposits in short duration agency mortgage-backed securities with commensurate risk adjusted yields.\" \"Our current quarter's net interest margin was negatively impacted by both elevated interest earning cash balance and short-term market interest rates on our variable rate commercial loan portfolio on a linked quarter basis,\" stated Andrew C. Sagliocca , Vice Chairman, CEO, and President. \"Our active asset-liability management including, but not limited to, managing our client centric commercial law firm lending renewals including interest rate spreads and floors, measured and flexible deposit-liability management, and continued commercial loan and core deposit growth will continue to produce industry leading growth, earnings, returns, and performance metrics in the future. Lastly, as in previous years, we anticipate that a portion of the elevated draws on existing commercial litigation related loans may paydown, tempering first quarter loan growth. However, based on our current commercial loan pipeline, we anticipate 2025 loan growth to be commensurate to prior years.\" (1) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 See non-GAAP reconciliation provided at the end of this news release. Fourth Quarter Earnings Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 was $11.8 million , or $1.37 per diluted share, compared to $9.9 million , or $1.18 per diluted share for the same period in 2023. Returns on average assets and equity for the current quarter were 2.49% and 19.99%, respectively, compared to 2.59% and 20.78% for the same period of 2023. Net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2024 increased $4.2 million , or 18.6%, to $26.9 million , due to growth in average interest earning assets (funded with low-cost core deposits) totaling $353.0 million , or 24.0%, to $1.82 billion when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Our net interest margin remained strong at 5.87%, decreasing 25 basis points when compared to the same period in 2023. Our net interest margin was negatively impacted by changes in our average interest earning asset composition including cash and securities as well as decreases in short-term market interest rates. Average loan yields decreased 3 basis points to 7.78% while average loans increased $146.0 million , or 12.5%, to $1.32 billion , primarily due to growth in our national commercial litigation related lending. Loan interest income increased $2.7 million , or 11.7%, to $25.7 million with the increase in average loan balances (primarily commercial) comprising $3.4 million of the increase, offset by a $742 thousand decrease in average rate due to decreases in short-term market interest rates. Our loan-to-deposit ratio was 85% as our low-cost deposit base increased $234.9 million , or 17.0%, primarily due to growth in our longer duration escrow or IOLTA deposit relationships while our cost of funds on interest bearing deposits remained relatively unchanged. Based on our decision to proactively moderate commercial real estate growth in 2024 due to market sentiment, excess funding was invested in short duration agency mortgage-backed securities with commensurate risk adjusted yields, enhancing our liquidity while improving the securities to total assets ratio to 16.6%. Average securities in the quarter increased $84.9 million to $303.0 million and yields increased 82 basis points to 3.44%, increasing securities income by $1.2 million with $653 thousand attributable to average volume increases and $527 thousand attributable to increases in average rate. Due to the significant increase in core deposits during the current quarter, average interest earning cash balances increased $122.2 million , or 147%, to $205.3 million when comparing the current quarter to the comparable quarter in 2023, negatively impacting our net interest margin by approximately 13 basis points. By year-end 2024, the majority of this excess cash was deployed into higher yielding commercial loans. The provision for credit losses was $1.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, a $200 thousand increase from the fourth quarter 2023 provision. As of December 31, 2024 , our allowance to loans ratio was 1.50% as compared to 1.38% as of December 31, 2023 . The increase in the allowance as a percentage of loans was general reserve driven considering elevated loan growth/net draws in the current quarter and qualitative factors associated with the current short-term interest rate environment as well as the current uncertain economic environment including, but not limited to, its potential impact on the New York metro multifamily and commercial real estate market. Noninterest income totaled $6.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to $6.3 million in the same period for 2023. Payment processing income was $5.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, a $330 thousand decrease from the same period in 2023, primarily due to anticipated ISO and merchant attrition and changes in the volumes of our overall merchant risk profile. Payment processing volumes for the credit and debit card processing platform increased $727.2 million , or 8.6%, to $9.2 billion and transactions decreased 10.1 million, or 6.5%, to 145.7 million, for the current quarter, as compared to the same period in 2023. We continue to focus on the expansion of sales channels through ISOs, prudently managing risk while focusing on new merchant originations, increasing overall volumes as well as risk profiles, and expanding our technology and other resources in the payments vertical. The Company utilizes proprietary and industry leading/customized technology to ensure card brand and regulatory compliance, supports multiple processing platforms, manages daily risk across 88,000 small business merchants in all 50 states, and performs commercial treasury clearing services for $9.2 billion in volume across 145.7 million in transactions in the current quarter. ASP fee income increased $134 thousand to $714 thousand for the fourth quarter of 2024. ASP fee income is directly impacted by the average balances of off-balance sheet sweep funds as well as current short-term market interest rates. Other noninterest income increased $99 thousand to $367 thousand when compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to increases in loan and other banking fees. Noninterest expense increased $1.8 million , or 12.8%, to $15.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits, data processing, advertising and marketing, and occupancy and equipment. Employee compensation and benefits costs increased $873 thousand , or 10.0%, due to the impact of year end salary increases, bonuses, incentive pay to business development officers (\"BDOs\"), and stock-based compensation increases. Data processing costs increased $329 thousand due to increases in core banking processing volumes and additional costs related to enhanced risk management systems and other technology implementations. Advertising and marketing costs increased $205 thousand as we continued to advance our digital marketing platform across our commercial litigation platform nationally, expand our thought leadership in this national vertical, and directly support our regional BDOs with targeted hyper-personalized account based marketing (\"ABM\") campaigns. Occupancy and equipment costs increased $170 thousand due to amortization of internally developed software to support our digital marketing and risk management platforms and additional office space to support our growth. Our investment in current resources has and will continue to support future growth. The Company's efficiency ratio was 47.5% for the three months ended December 31, 2024 , as compared to 48.0% in 2023. Our strong efficiency ratio is a result of our continued growth primarily driven by our core national platforms that have (and will continue to) benefit from our investments in technology/risk management, digital marketing, employees, and other branchless infrastructure that support our industry leading returns. The effective tax rate was 25.0% for the fourth quarter of 2024, as compared to 27.0% for the fourth quarter of 2023, resulting from certain discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Full Year Earnings Net income for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $43.7 million , or $5.14 per diluted share, compared to $41.0 million , or $4.91 per diluted share for the same period in 2023. Returns on average assets and equity for the year ended December 31, 2024 were 2.57% and 20.14%, respectively, compared to 2.89% and 23.20% for the same period of 2023. Excluding the gain of $4.0 million ( $2.9 million after-tax or $0.35 per diluted share) on our equity investments in 2023, adjusted (1) net income, diluted earnings per share, return on average assets, and return on average common equity for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $38.1 million , $4.56 , 2.68% and 21.54%, respectively. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $16.2 million , or 19.3%, to $99.9 million , due to growth in average interest earning assets totaling $273.2 million , or 19.9%, to $1.65 billion as compared to the same period in 2023, as well as our strong net interest margin of 6.06%. Our net interest income was positively impacted primarily by growth in higher yielding variable rate commercial loans and growth in lower-cost escrow or IOLTA deposits nationally. The average yield on loans increased 10 basis points to 7.82%, primarily driven by growth in higher yielding variable rate commercial loans. During 2024, average loans for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $207.0 million , or 19.7%, to $1.26 billion , primarily due to growth in our national commercial lending platform and, to a lesser extent, growth in our regional multifamily loan portfolio primarily during the latter part of 2023. Loan interest income increased $17.3 million , or 21.3%, to $98.5 million with increases in average loan balances (primarily commercial) comprising $16.7 million of the increase and $588 thousand (primarily multifamily) representing increases in average rate. During 2024, average deposits increased $230.0 million , or 31.6%, to $958 million , primarily due to growth in escrow or IOLTA deposits nationally. Our deposit cost-of-funds, excluding demand deposits, increased 29 basis points in the current year when compared to the same period in 2023 due to increases in short-term interest rates as well as management proactively increasing rates on IOLTA accounts in the certain states where we operate. Deposit expense increased $5.3 million to $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 with increases in average rate comprising $3.3 million and $2.0 million attributable to increases in average balances. Average securities for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $54.9 million to $265.7 million and yields increased 87 basis points to 3.25% due to our previously noted balance sheet strategy. In 2024, the combined increase in average loans and securities totaled $261.9 million , or approximately 20.7%, to $1.52 billion as compared to 2023. The provision for credit losses was $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 , a $175 thousand increase from the same period in 2023. As of December 31, 2024 , our allowance to loans ratio was 1.50% as compared to 1.38% as of December 31, 2023 . The increase in the allowance as a percentage of loans was general reserve driven considering loan growth and qualitative factors associated with the current short-term interest rate environment as well as the current uncertain economic environment including, but not limited to, its potential impact on the New York metro multifamily and commercial real estate market. Noninterest income totaled $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $29.8 million in the same period for 2023. Excluding the $4.0 million gain on our equity investments in 2023, adjusted (1) noninterest income was $25.7 million . In 2024, payment processing income was $20.9 million , a $1.4 million decrease when compared to 2023, primarily due to anticipated ISO attrition and changes in our overall merchant risk profile. Payment processing volumes and transactions for the credit and debit card processing platform increased $3.3 billion , or 10.0%, to $36.3 billion and transactions decreased 9.0 million, or 1.5%, to 603.7 million transactions, respectively, when comparing the full-year 2024 to 2023. We continue to focus on the expansion of sales channels through ISOs, prudently managing risk while focusing on new merchant originations, increasing overall volumes as well as risk profiles, and expanding our technology and other resources in this vertical. The Company utilizes proprietary and industry leading/customized technology to ensure card brand and regulatory compliance, supports multiple processing platforms, manages daily risk across 88,000 small business merchants in all 50 states, and performs commercial treasury clearing services for $36.3 billion in volume across 603.7 million in transactions in the current year.\u00a0 In 2024, ASP fee income increased $271 thousand to $2.7 million when compared to 2023. ASP fee income is directly impacted by the average balances of off-balance sheet sweep funds as well as current short-term market interest rates. Other noninterest income increased $327 thousand to $1.3 million when comparing 2023 to 2024, primarily due to increases in loan and other banking related fees. Noninterest expense increased $7.7 million , or 14.5%, to $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 , as compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits, advertising and marketing, data processing, and occupancy and equipment, partially offset by decreases in professional services costs. Employee compensation and benefits costs increased $5.4 million , or 16.5%, due to the full year's impact of key hires (throughout 2023) to support future growth and excellence in client service as well as the impact of year end salary increases, bonuses, incentive pay to BDOs, and stock-based compensation increases. During 2024, we experienced the full year impact of our 2023 key hires including, but not limited to, our regional senior BDOs, sales support, lending underwriting/lending support, and risk management staffing initiatives. Advertising and marketing costs increased $1.7 million as we continued to advance our digital marketing platform across our commercial litigation platform nationally, expand our thought leadership in this national vertical, and directly support our regional BDOs with targeted ABM campaigns. Data processing costs increased $1.5 million due to increases in core banking processing volumes and additional costs related to enhanced risk management systems and other technology implementations. Occupancy and equipment costs increased $730 thousand due to amortization of internally developed software to support our digital marketing and risk management platforms and additional office space to support growth. Professional services costs decreased $1.6 million primarily due to our 2023 hiring initiatives noted above and related costs associated with the executive search firm utilized. Our investment in current resources has and will continue to support our future growth. The Company's efficiency ratio was 48.7% for the year ended December 31, 2024 , as compared to 46.8% for the same period in 2023. The adjusted (1) efficiency ratio was 48.5% for the year ended December 31, 2023 , excluding the aforementioned $4.0 million pre-tax gain. Our strong efficiency ratio is a result of our continued growth primarily driven by our core national platforms. These platforms have benefited from our investments in technology/risk management systems, digital marketing, employees, and other branchless infrastructure that support our industry leading returns. The effective tax rate was 26.4% for the year ended December 31, 2024 , compared to 26.6% for the same period in 2023. (1) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 See non-GAAP reconciliation provided at the end of this news release. Asset Quality At December 31, 2024 , we had one nonperforming multifamily loan totaling $10.9 million , no exposure to commercial office space nor construction loans, and $14.7 million in performing loans to the hospitality industry. The allowance for credit losses was $21.0 million , or 1.50% of total loans, as compared to $16.6 million , or 1.38% of total loans at December 31, 2023 . The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans and total assets was 0.78% and 0.58%, respectively. The allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 192%. The increase in the allowance as a percentage of loans was general reserve driven considering loan growth and qualitative factors associated with the current short-term interest rate environment as well as the current uncertain economic environment including, but not limited to, its potential impact on the New York metro multifamily and commercial real estate market. Due to increases in market interest rates since 2022, management enhanced its ongoing credit risk management monitoring of its commercial real estate loan portfolio. The following is a brief summary of our risk management results for our multifamily and CRE portfolios as of December 31, 2024 : The multifamily portfolio, excluding one nonperforming loan, totaling $344.2 million , has a current weighted average DSCR and an original LTV (defined as unpaid principal balance as of December 31, 2024 divided by appraised value at origination) of approximately 1.64 and 54%, respectively, and the CRE portfolio, totaling $87.0 million , has a current weighted average DSCR and an original LTV of approximately 1.48 and 58%, respectively. Multifamily loans maturing in less than one year totaled $59.5 million and had a current weighted average DSCR and an original LTV of approximately 1.34 and 57%, respectively. CRE loans maturing in less than one year totaled $1.7 million and had a current weighted average DSCR and an original LTV of approximately 1.60 and 66%, respectively. Multifamily loans maturing in one to two years totaled $48.4 million and had a current weighted average DSCR and an original LTV of approximately 1.39 and 66%, respectively. CRE loans maturing in one to two years totaled $3.8 million and had a current weighted average DSCR and an original LTV of approximately 1.39 and 55%, respectively. Balance Sheet At December 31, 2024 , total assets were $1.89 billion , reflecting a $275.6 million , or 17.0% increase from December 31, 2023 . This increase was primarily attributable to growth in loans totaling $189.6 million , or 15.7%, to $1.40 billion . Our higher yielding variable rate commercial loans increased $182.7 million , or 24.8%, during this same period (litigation related loans increased $223.4 million , or 36.5%, to $835.8 million ). Our commercial relationship banking sales pipeline remained robust, anchored by our national platforms, regional BDOs, and supported by our competitive advantages in data, analytics and digital marketing. Our available-for-sale securities portfolio increased $119.6 million to $241.7 million as compared to December 31, 2023 , as management deployed excess liquidity into securities as part of our previously mentioned balance sheet management strategy. Our held-to-maturity securities portfolio totaled $68.7 million , a decrease of $8.3 million , or 10.8%, due to portfolio amortization. In the third quarter of 2023, management elected to close out its reverse repurchase agreements and reinvest these funds into higher yielding commercial loans.\u00a0 Our total securities to assets ratio was 16.6% at December 31, 2024 as compared to 12.5% in the comparable prior year, enhancing our liquidity position, asset composition, and flexibility in the future. The following table provides information regarding the composition of our loan portfolio for the periods presented: December\u00a031, September\u00a030, December\u00a031, 2024 2024 2023 (Dollars in\u00a0thousands) Real estate: Multifamily $ 355,165 25.4 % $ 350,857 27.0 % $ 348,241 28.8 % Commercial real estate 87,038 6.2 87,544 6.8 89,498 7.4 1 \u2013 4 family 14,665 1.1 14,749 1.1 17,937 1.5 Total real estate 456,868 32.7 453,150 34.9 455,676 37.7 Commercial: Litigation related 835,839 59.8 727,749 56.1 612,457 50.7 Other 84,728 6.1 97,690 7.5 125,457 10.4 Total commercial 920,567 65.9 825,439 63.6 737,914 61.1 Consumer 19,339 1.4 18,874 1.5 14,491 1.2 Total loans held for investment $ 1,396,774 100.0 % $ 1,297,463 100.0 % $ 1,208,081 100.0 % Deferred loan fees and unearned premiums, net 247 (20) (668) Loans, held for investment $ 1,397,021 $ 1,297,443 $ 1,207,413 Total deposits were $1.64 billion as of December 31, 2024 , a $234.9 million , or 16.7%, increase from December 31, 2023 . This was primarily due to a $203.9 million , or 22.0%, increase in Savings, NOW and Money Market deposits, primarily driven by our IOLTA and other escrow deposits as well as a $24.7 million , or 5.2%, increase in noninterest bearing demand deposits. Our deposit strategy primarily focuses on developing full service branchless commercial banking relationships nationally with our clients through commercial lending facilities, payment processing, and other unique commercial cash management services in our two national verticals, rather than competing with other institutions on rate. Our longer duration IOLTA, escrow and settlement deposits represent $979.0 million , or 59.6%, of total deposits. As of December 31, 2024 , uninsured deposits were $463.9 million , or 28%, of our total deposits of $1.64 billion , excluding $12.4 million of affiliate deposits held by the Bank. Approximately 80% of our uninsured deposits represent clients with full commercial relationship banking with us (i.e.-commercial loans, payment processing, and other commercial service-oriented relationships) including, but not limited to, law firm operating accounts, law firm IOLTA/escrow accounts, merchant reserves, ISO reserves, ACH processing, and custodial accounts. Due to the nature of our larger mass tort and class action settlements related to the litigation vertical, we participate in FDIC insured sweep programs as well as treasury secured money market funds. As of December 31, 2024 , off-balance sheet sweep funds totaled approximately $554.4 million , of which approximately $424.2 million , or 76.5%, was available to be swept on balance sheet as reciprocal client relationship deposits. Our deposit growth and off-balance sheet funds continue to demonstrate our highly efficient branchless and technology enabled deposit platforms. At December 31, 2024 , we had the ability to borrow, on a secured basis, up to $431 .7\u00a0million from the FHLB of New York and $51.4 million from the FRB of New\u00a0York discount window.\u00a0No borrowing amounts were outstanding during the fourth quarter of 2024. Historically, we have not leveraged our balance sheet to generate earnings and have always utilized core client deposits to fund our asset growth and related earnings. Stockholders' equity increased $38.5 million to $237.1 million as of December 31, 2024 , when compared to December 31, 2023 , primarily driven by increases in retained earnings (net income). During the fourth quarter 2024, the increase in retained earnings (net income) was offset by increases in (1) other comprehensive losses (unrealized net losses on securities available-for-sale, net of taxes) of $4.0 million to $14.3 million due to changes in market interest rates and (2) increases in treasury stock of $3.1 million to $5.7 million due to the vesting of stock grants.

Consolidated Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliation (unaudited) (all dollars in thousands except per share data) We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide information that is important to investors and that is useful in understanding our financial position, results and ratios. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and are not a substitute for an analysis based on GAAP measures. As other companies may use different calculations for this measure, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures by other companies.
