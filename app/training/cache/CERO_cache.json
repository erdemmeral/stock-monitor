[{"text": "Is Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) the Best Falling Stock to Invest in Right Now? Neha Gupta Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 3:45 PM 5 min read In This Article: BUD We recently published a list of 10 Best Falling Stocks to Invest in Right Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) stands against other best falling stocks to invest in right now. The overall stock market has been in an uptrend, as depicted by major indices trading near all-time highs. The rally has come at the back of several key factors, including artificial intelligence frenzy and optimism about accommodative monetary policies, with the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates. After two years of consecutive gains, valuations have gotten out of hand, with some stocks trading at levels and multiples not seen in years. The eye-watering valuations are raising concerns among value investors, constantly on the hunt for bargains. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management analysts have also fired warning shots about valuations that have gotten out of hand. According to analysts\u2019 expectations of earnings growth are too ambitious at a time when it is still unclear what President Donald Trump will do. \u201cPolicy uncertainty from the new administration appears underpriced. 2025 is not at all like 2017, and we view the risks as much higher,\u201d said Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer and head of the wealth management unit\u2019s global investment office. According to Shalett, investors are better off diversifying their portfolio by pairing investments in domestic stocks and bonds with equities outside the US.

While the rally in the equity markets has come on growing expectations that the US Fed will cut interest rates aggressively, it could stall as President Trump swings into action. According to UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti, the expected decline in interest rates could be stalled should Trump impose tariffs on allies. \u201cSomething that I\u2019ve been saying for a while, inflation is much stickier than we have been saying. The [truth] of the matter is that we need to see also how tariffs will play a role in inflation. Tariffs will probably not really help inflation to come down. And therefore I don\u2019t see rates coming down as fast as people believe,\u201d Ermotti said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Most stocks trading at all-time highs are enjoying premium valuations on investors betting on them amid expectations of lower interest rates. Amid the blockbuster gains, some stocks have gone the opposite way, tanking to levels not seen in years. The selloff that has come into play has given rise to undervalued stocks trading close to their 52-week lows. While the prospects of the selloff persist, stocks are also showing signs of bottoming out. Consequently, the best-falling stocks to invest in are companies backed by solid underlying fundamentals affirming their long-term prospects. Story Continues For good reason, economists are upbeat about the US economy and stock market. In the United States, GDP growth has been steady, interest rates are predicted to decline, and the incoming president is firmly pro-business. That presents a perfect environment for fallen stocks with solid fundamentals to bounce back. Since value stocks are already priced at or below their intrinsic value, they should theoretically have a lower downside risk. Our Methodology To make our list of the best falling stocks to invest in right now, we scanned the US stock market for stocks that have fallen significantly and are trading close to their 52-week lows (0-10% above). We then settled on the top ten fallen stocks that have the potential to bounce back. We finally ranked these stocks based on their upside potential.

2025, 5:54 PM 6 min read The Quantified STF Fund Tops Morningstar Category for Fourth Time in Eight Years BLOOMFIELD HILLS, Mich. , Jan. 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Flexible Plan Investments, Ltd . (FPI), a leading provider of dynamic, risk-managed investment solutions with over $1.5 billion in assets under management (12/31/24), announced that its Quantified STF Fund (QSTFX) was the top performer in the Morningstar Tactical Allocation category (246 funds) in 2024 returning 29.94%. Additionally, the fund sits atop the category (213 funds) for the five-year period ended 12/31/24. It is a repeat performance for the fund as it also led the category in 2023. The fund outpaced its benchmark, the NASDAQ 100\u00ae Index, that returned 25.88% for the past calendar year. It is the fourth time the fund has led its category in the past eight years (2017, 2020, 2023, 2024). The fund was in the bottom decile of performance for its category during the calendar years 2016, 2018, and 2022. \"The repeat performance in 2024 of the STF fund is a result of our team's ability to identify and capitalize on trends while also enhancing our model to evolve with the markets and volatility. The fact that the fund leads in the category for the five-year period, as well, speaks to our objective to provide consistency and predictability in our strategies. STF can be positioned up to two-times long versus the NASDAQ 100\u00ae Index and up to one-times short, depending upon market direction and conditions. While sometimes volatile, the ability to go long and short is part of our dynamic, risk management approach,\" said Jerry Wagner , founder and president of FPI and one of the portfolio managers for the 14 Quantified Funds. Mr. Wagner further added \"Flexible Plan uses the fund extensively in its most popular dynamic, risk-managed SMA strategy: QFC Self-Adjusting Trend Following.\u00a0 Although the fund is aggressive and has even found itself ranked for some years at or near the bottom of its category, using the strategy version reduces its volatility.\u00a0 Another popular FPI strategy, QFC Equity Trends, further reduces the volatility to allow its use with growth investors.\u00a0 Finally, investors with a wide range of suitability profiles can make use of the fund in FPI's Multi-Strategy Portfolios \u2013 available for Conservative, Moderate, Balanced, Growth and Aggressive suitability profiles.\" With respect to the 14 Quantified Funds, Flexible Plan is a subadvisor to Advisors Preferred , a boutique asset manager that manages mutual funds. Advisors Preferred, through its affiliated distributor, Ceros Financial Services, Inc., distributes these funds to financial advisors and financial professionals. Story Continues \"We're thrilled that the STF Fund repeated as the top performer in its category this past year. Knowing that no two years are the same in the markets, we believe this accomplishment speaks to the adaptable, dynamic approach that Flexible Plan employs and shows that strategies like this have a place in professionally managed portfolios,\" said Catherine Ayers-Rigsby , president of Advisors Preferred.

Dive Brief: Nearly seven in 10 corporate executives responding to a recent KPMG survey said they plan to invest between $50 million to $250 million in generative artificial intelligence over the next 12 months, up from 45% in first quarter 2024 poll results. The Big Four accounting firm\u2019s latest study also found that h alf of business leaders are currently scaling their generative AI deployments. \u201cBusinesses are moving from experimentation and research and development into actually putting the AI out there and expecting outcomes,\u201d Todd Lohr, head of ecosystems at KPMG\u2019s U.S. advisory division , said in an interview. Dive Insight: The research comes as analysts are predicting that 2025 will be a pivotal year for generative AI adoption among enterprises, as C-suite leaders encounter a new wave of tools and innovations while also facing return-on-investment pressures. \u201c Obvious use cases that enterprises experimented with last year are now table stakes and embedded in business software ,\u201d Forrester Research said in its 2025 technology and security predictions report. \u201c Leaders are realizing that ROI from investments will take longer than they anticipated and are shifting toward pragmatically delivering ROI over time .\u201d Investor pressure to demonstrate ROI on generative AI investments is \u201cimportant or very important\u201d for 68% of business leaders, KPMG found in its latest survey. The coming year brings an opportunity to scale and advance AI capabilities across the enterprise, and a majority of organizations are looking to AI agents \u2014\u00a0tools that can work independently to perform tasks and adapt in real time \u2014\u00a0to help do so, KPMG said in a release announcing the research. Over half (51%) of organizations are exploring the use of AI agents and another 37% are piloting them, the survey found. The study analyzed companies\u2019 generative AI investment plans across different spending ranges, with mixed results. Nearly half (49%) of respondents said they plan to spend between $50 million to $100 million on the technology over the next 12 months, compared with 23% in the Q1 2024 poll. Only 2% said they will spend $250 million or above this year, down from 21%. Meanwhile, 8%\u00a0of leaders said they plan to spend less than $10 million, down from 14%. \u201cThere was a pretty big jump in that sweet spot of $50 million to $100 million,\u201d Lohr told CFO Dive.

Announces Reverse Stock Split CERo Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. Mon, Jan 6, 2025, 4:00 PM 7 min read In This Article: CERO CEROW CERo Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. SOUTH SAN FRANSCISCO, Calif., Jan. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CERo Therapeutics Holdings, Inc., (Nasdaq: CERO) (\u201cCERo\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) an innovative immunotherapy company seeking to advance the next generation of engineered T cell therapeutics that employ phagocytic mechanisms, today announced that its board of directors has determined to effect a one-for-one hundred reverse stock split of the Company\u2019s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the \u201cCommon Stock\u201d). The reverse stock split will take effect at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on January 8, 2025, and the Company\u2019s Common Stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on The Nasdaq Global Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) as of the opening of trading on January 8, 2025.\u00a0 The CUSIP number of 71902K303 will be assigned to the Company\u2019s Common Stock when the reverse stock split becomes effective. When the reverse stock split becomes effective, every one hundred (100) of the Company\u2019s issued shares of Common Stock will be combined into one issued share of Common Stock, without any change to the par value per share. This will reduce the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock from approximately 260 million shares to approximately 2.6 million shares. Proportional adjustments will also be made to the number of shares of Common Stock awarded and available for issuance under the Company\u2019s equity incentive plans, as well as the exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon the exercise or conversion of the Company\u2019s outstanding stock options and other equity securities under the Company\u2019s equity incentive plans. Additionally, all outstanding shares of preferred stock will be adjusted in accordance with their terms, which will, among other changes to the preferred stock terms, result in proportionate adjustments being made to the number of shares issuable upon exercise of such preferred stock and to the conversion prices of such preferred stock. All outstanding warrants will also be adjusted in accordance with their terms, which will, among other changes to the warrant terms, result in proportionate adjustments being made to the number of shares issuable upon exercise of such warrants and to the exercise and redemption prices of such warrants. No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Stockholders who would otherwise hold a fraction of a share of Common Stock of the Company will automatically be entitled to receive an additional fraction of a share of Common Stock to round up to the next whole share. Stockholders with shares held in book-entry form or through a bank, broker, or other nominee are not required to take any action and will see the consequence of the reverse stock split reflected in their accounts on or after January 8, 2025. Such beneficial holders may contact their bank, broker, or nominee for more information. Story Continues The reverse stock split ratio approved by the board of directors is within the previously disclosed range of ratios for a reverse stock split authorized by the stockholders of the Company at the Autumn 2024 Special Meeting of Stockholders of the Company held on November 11, 2024. On July 19, 2024, the Company received a letter (the \u201cBid Price Requirement Letter\u201d) from the staff at Nasdaq notifying the Company that, for the 30 consecutive trading days prior to the date of the Bid Price Requirement Letter, the closing bid price for the Common Stock had been below the minimum $1.00 per share, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 450(a)(1), which is required for continued listing of the Common Stock on Nasdaq (the \u201cBid Price Requirement\u201d). On October 24, 2024, the Company received a letter from the staff at The Nasdaq Global Market notifying the Company that, because its Common Stock had a closing bid price of $0.10 or less for ten consecutive trading days, it was no longer eligible to rely upon the 180-day cure period set forth in the Bid Price Requirement Letter. Such deficiency results in the commencement of delisting proceedings. However, the Company presented a compliance plan to Nasdaq at a hearing on December 17, 2024 with respect to all applicable deficiencies. The Company believes that the reverse stock split will increase the market price for its Common Stock and cure the deficiency in the Bid Price Requirement. About CERo Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. CERo is an innovative immunotherapy company advancing the development of next generation engineered T cell therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. Its proprietary approach to T cell engineering, which enables it to integrate certain desirable characteristics of both innate and adaptive immunity into a single therapeutic construct, is designed to engage the body\u2019s full immune repertoire to achieve optimized cancer therapy. This novel cellular immunotherapy platform is expected to redirect patient-derived T cells to eliminate tumors by building in engulfment pathways that employ phagocytic mechanisms to destroy cancer cells, creating what CERo refers to as Chimeric Engulfment Receptor T cells (\u201cCER-T\u201d). CERo believes the differentiated activity of CER-T cells will afford them greater therapeutic application than currently approved chimeric antigen receptor (\u201cCAR-T\u201d) cell therapy, as the use of CER-T may potentially span both hematological malignancies and solid tumors. CERo anticipates initiating clinical trials for its lead product candidate, CER-1236, in 2024 for hematological malignancies.

This Article: DVCMY BUD DEO While still a small part of the global alcoholic drinks industry, the market for non-alcoholic alternatives continues to grow \u2013 and continues to attract investment from the industry\u2019s major players. Recent market analysis from GlobalData, Just Drinks\u2019 parent, suggests the value of the combined, global, non-alcoholic beer and cider market will reach $11.6bn by 2027, growing roughly 16% on what is forecast for 2024. Non-alcoholic spirits is a smaller market but is forecast by GlobalData to see greater growth, being forecast to increase 36.7% in value between 2024 and 2028, to $478.9m. Big players in alcohol have taken note, and growing numbers have now made significant moves in the space: be it through M&A, developing brand extensions, launching standalone non-alcoholic products, or making investments in specialist facilities and technologies. When it comes to commitments to growing the no-and-low category within their own portfolios, not all brewing and distilling heavyweights have established clear targets around sales or volumes. While some are clear on their expectations for the segment, others prefer to remain cautious, committing to investing in brands and technology but not with any specific goals in mind. Here, Just Drinks presents a rolling guide of how some of the industry's heavyweights are looking to tap into the growing interest in no-and-low. Asahi\u00a0Group Holdings Non-alcoholic drinks play a major role in Asahi\u2019s corporate vision. As part of its Legacy 2030 strategy, the company is looking to have 20% of its group-wide portfolio made up by non-alcoholic and low-alcohol products in six years\u2019 time. Meanwhile, the group\u2019s domestic alcohol business Asahi Breweries is aiming to have 20% of its sales volumes made up by drinks with 3.5% abv or less by next year. At the end of the first half of 2024, low- and no-alcohol products made up 12.1% of total sales, Asahi CEO Atsushi Katsuki told Just Drinks in a recent interview. Asahi\u2019s moves in M&A around in no-and-low alcohol have been few and far between but Katsuki said the group \u201cwould like to\u201d boost its investment in what he calls the \"beer-adjacent\" category, which includes non-alcoholic beer and RTDs but also soft drinks targeted at the adult market. One of the group\u2019s most recent M&A ventures in the area was in January 2024, when its US-based venture capital arm Asahi Group Beverages and Innovation contributed to a Series A funding round for non-alcoholic drinks retailer The Zero Proof. A bottle of Peroni Nastro Azzurro 0.0. Credit: Asahi Group Holdings The Peroni brewer did not confirm the amount it had invested at the time but The Zero Proof noted in a separate statement that the company had \u201cled\u201d the round. Story Continues The US-based retailer imports and distributes a range of alternatives to full-strength alcoholic beverages. These include the likes of Oceano Zero, Oddbird and Noughty non-alcoholic wines, and Ish, Lyre\u2019s and Pentire 0% spirits.\u00a0It also provides a wholesale service to on- and off-trade businesses in the US. Speaking to Just Drinks in the interview, Katsuki said that the company was in discussions with \u201ca few hundred\u201d startups though its US investment unit. He added that the company wanted to \u201ccontinue to be proactive\u201d in investing in start-ups in the beer-adjacent space, \u201ceven if we were to only take a minority stake\u201d. Much of Asahi's investment has been to launch non-alcoholic versions of its major beer brands, including Peroni Nastro Azzurro 0.0% and Asahi Super Dry 0.0%. Diageo UK-headquartered alcoholic drinks giant Diageo has invested significantly into its non-alcoholic brand extensions \u2013 from zero alcohol Captain Morgan\u2019s and Tanqueray to Guinness 0.0, among many others. The group\u2019s moves in no- and low-alcohol are a part of its Spirit of Progress ESG plan, but similar to other major drinks groups, the company is not looking to achieve a specific sales target with its low and no portfolio. In its 2024 annual report, the group said it looks to \u201cenable and reinforce the breadth of choices that consumers have to moderate\u201d in order to push \u201cpositive drinking attitudes and behaviours\u201d. In July last year, the group announced it was investing \u20ac25m to boost production capacity for the non-alcoholic variant of its Guinness Stout at its St. James\u2019s Gate site in Dublin, Ireland. The group plans to build a two-story facility with six processing vessels and a total capacity of 500,000 hectolitres. It claimed at the time that the move would help to boost production capacity of non-alcoholic Guinness by 300%. At the time of the announcement last year, the group said it was hoping to see the non-alcoholic stout make up 10% of total Guinness sales in Ireland \u201cover the next few years\u201d. As of September 2024, Guinness 0.0 is sold on draught in over 1,6000 on-trade sites across both Ireland and Northern Ireland. According to the group\u2019s 2024 annual report, Guinness 0.0 presently makes up around 3% of total global Guinness volumes. The company began the first official draught trials for the drink in the UK in the on-trade in September, starting with a small number of pubs in London, including the Devonshire in Soho. Anna MacDonald, Guinness marketing director for Diageo\u2019s Great Britain branch said at the time that the company was planning on bringing the 0.0 drink to more pubs nationwide \u201cas the year continues\u201d. Diageo has active when it comes to M&A in the emerging area of no-and-low. Seedlip, which is now probably one of the most well-known global alcohol-free spirits on the market, launched in 2015. The following year it was brought under the group\u2019s accelerator wing Distill Ventures, and in 2019, the group acquired the company for an unknown figure. The Don Julio Tequila owner\u2019s more recent investments into the non-alc category include New Delhi-based V9 Beverages , which the company\u2019s Indian business, United Spirits, took \u201cstrategic minority investments\u201d in earlier this year. It acquired a 15% stake in the group for Rs22.9m ($272.3m). Set up in 2020, V9 Beverages\u2019 alcohol-free spirits includes the Sober Gin, Sober Whiskey and Sober Rum variants. Most recently in September, the Tanqueray distiller acquired US-based non-alcoholic spirits group Ritual Zero Proof for an undisclosed sum. The company, which sells its products across the US in-store and online, produces a five SKUs range of Tequila, gin, rum and whiskey alternatives. Similarly to Seedlip, Diageo first took a minority stake in the business through its accelerator arm Distill Ventures in 2020. At the time, the London-headquartered group said the move was \u201cin line with Diageo\u2019s strategy to acquire high-growth brands in exciting categories\u201d. In addition to investments in its own brands, production and M&A, the group has also delved into sports partnerships with its 0.0 stout. While Guinness was the official sponsor for the Six Nations Rugby tournament since 2019, as of June 2024, the non-alcoholic variant was made the official beer partner for the English Premier League. Pernod Ricard The Paris-headquartered company\u2019s non-alcoholic portfolio is made up of a mixture of brands and brand extensions. The group\u2019s entry into zero-alcohol goes as far back as 1982, with its launch of Pacific non-alcoholic anis. More recent additions to the portfolio include Swedish Ceder\u2019s botanicals-based spirit which it acquired in 2021, Jacob\u2019s Creek Unvined wine, and the Suze Tonic 0% aperitif which is exclusive to France. Earlier this year, the group also launched a 0.0% variant of Beefeater gin, currently only sold in Spain, accompanying the 0.0% variant of Seagram\u2019s which has also been sold there since January 2023. Pernod has also dabbled in some investments in the non-alcoholic space, particularly in agave-based and ready-to-drink spirits alternatives. In August, the group took a minority stake in Lewis Hamilton-backed agave-based spirit Almave. The two SKUs range was developed with Mexican spirits producer and incubator Casa Lumbre and investment firm Cooper. It launched last year, and is currently available in the US, Canada and selected European markets, including the UK, Ireland and Germany. Speaking with Just Drinks in September, Casa Lumbre said it was hoping to see the brand enter the UAE next year. Almave Ambar non-alcoholic agave-based spirit. Credit: Casa Lumbre In 2023, the Chivas Regal distiller also injected an undisclosed sum into AF Drinks , a New Zealand-based non-alcoholic RTDs producer.\u00a0The investment was made through its investment leg Convivialit\u00e9 Ventures. AF Drinks produces a range of canned non-alcoholic variants of popular mixed drinks, including a Grapefruit Margarita, Dark & Stormy and Cuba Libre. The Auckland-based group sells in New Zealand and the US, where it is known as Free AF. In September of last year, the Codigo Tequila distiller\u2019s venture capital branch also contributed to the non-alc retailer Boisson\u2019s $5m bridge funding round . While the Absolut vodka owner has no specific set goals, its intention to grow the performance and potential of its non-alcoholic drinks is clear, given the group established a specialist business unit for the category in 2022, based at its headquarters in Paris. In its most recent annual report for 2023, the group said the unit was to focus on utilising \u201cexpertise in marketing, insights, operations and business development\u201d. The group also notes that it has made investments \u201cin new technical facilities dedicated to accelerating our expertise\u201d in non-alcoholic spirits. The Jameson whiskey maker does not disclose the amount it invests in the non-alcoholic space. Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgian and US brewing major Anheuser Busch InBev (AB InBev) is another brewer that homed its focus in on in the non-alcoholic category. The Leffe brewer has increased the number of no-and-low alcohol beer products in its portfolio by 60% and volumes by more than 23% since 2019. When it comes to the group\u2019s strategy, AB InBev does not actively share a specific no- and low-alcohol growth target. In 2022, reports from Reuters indicated the company believed it was already set to miss its goal of having 20% of global sales made up of no- and low-alcohol beers by 2025. In April, group global vice president of corporate affairs Andres Pe\u00f1ate told journalists at its headquarters in Leuven, Belgium, that the business did not expect to hit that 2025 target, but it was \u201ccloser than yesterday\u201d. The no and low segment sits under its \u2018occasions development\u2019 focus category, as a part of its goal to \u2018lead and grow the category\u2019 of beer. In its latest annual report for 2023, the Budweiser brewer said it was \u201cexpanding beer consumption beyond traditional occasions\u201d with its zero-alcoholic products, \u201cdeveloping brands focused on the meals occasion\u201d as well as \u201cin the in-home occasion through our digital direct-to-consumer brands\u201d. Discussing the group\u2019s confidence in no and low in Belgium earlier this year, CEO of the company\u2019s European arm Jason Warner said AB InBev saw \u201ca unique opportunity\u201d in positioning its non-alcoholic beers in the \u201cadult refreshment\u201d space, with growth of non-alcoholic beers being seen more and more outside of \u201ctraditional beer consumption moments\u201d. In 2023, the Jupiler producer made a \u20ac31m investment in the renovation of its non-alcoholic brewing technologies at its breweries in Sin-Pieters-Leeuw, Hoegaarden and Leuven in Belgium. Corona Cero beer bottle at the Leuven Stella Artois brewery, Leuven, Belgium. Credit: Just Drinks The money was to be used to help grow the brewing giant\u2019s non-alcoholic portfolio, which includes zero-alcohol variants of Leffe, Hoegaarden, Stella Artois and Corona Cero, among others. Warner told Just Drinks at group headquarters earlier this year that the group was also in the process of building up its de-alcoholisation tech in the UK. \u201cWe have the de-alcoholisation plan here, we have one in Germany and we\u2019re building one into the UK right now. We\u2019re getting the necessary scale that we\u2019re going to need.\u201d In 2024, the group has also struck a deal for Corona Cero to be the global beer sponsor for the Olympic Games through to 2028. Following the Paris edition earlier this year, the beer will also sponsor the games in Milano-Cortina in 2026 and Los Angeles in 2028. The agreement, which was made for an unknown figure, is the International Olympic Committee\u2019s (IOC) first TOP (The Olympic Partners) partnership with an alcohol brand. Warner told reporters earlier this year in Belgium that Corona Cero \u201cis a brand that\u2019s really starting to get to scale. It\u2019s growing fast and, since we\u2019ve introduced this brand into non-alcohol, we are the fastest-growing lager brand in Europe\u201d. He also told Just Drinks that Corona Cero would be in 23 markets by the end of 2024, which includes a new entry into Italy. When it comes down to M&A, the business hasn\u2019t been as active in the no-alcohol category, preferring to home in on developing its own brand extensions. While already producing non-alcoholic variants of a number of its signature brands, in September, the group\u2019s US arm, Anheuser-Busch, announced plans to roll out a 0.0% version of Michelob Ultra. The 0% abv Michelob Ultra Zero is to be available \u201cwherever Michelob Ultra is sold\u201d from January 2025. Campari Group Italian spirits giant Campari also sees non-alcoholic drinks options as a significant part of its business strategy, with a particular focus on non-alcoholic aperitifs. In its 2023 annual report, the Aperol owner said one of its \"key strategic priorities\" was to \"expand\" its \"leadership in Italian icons\" through both its alcoholic and non-alcoholic portfolio. The report notes: \"the experience of the pandemic showed that consumer habits, the path towards the market and the assortment of brands may adapt in changing environments. Therefore, the Group feels the need to continuously evolve its strategy to be more agile, successful and sustainability-oriented. \"Recruiting new young customers and exploiting with courage emotional moments defined by social dynamics to discover the opportunities, geographical areas and categories of new consumers, is a \u2018must-have\u2019 to be fulfilled through the Group\u2019s fantastic premium brands in the aperitif, amari and non-alcoholic segments\". Campari Group's non-alcoholic aperitivo, Crodino. Credit: Campari Group The Milan-headquartered company first entered the non-alc space in 1995 with its acquisition of the Italian 0% abv aperitif Crodino. The brand has been available in Italy since the 1960s, but the group has only more recently introduced the brand to new markets like Austria, Switzerland, France. Campari launched the drink in the UK in 2021. Campari Group also has an independent non-alcoholic brand called The Notes, which launched in 2021. The brand is designed for use in the off-premise and is currently sold in Italy. Bacardi Privately-owned Bacardi was one of the early heavyweights to enter the non-alcoholic spirits category. Its first steps in the space were in 2020 with the launch of an alcohol-free Martini range in Europe which eventually made its way to North America in 2022. While the company does not have any specific targets set in place around non-alcoholic drinks sales, they do feature in its most recent ESG report for 2024. Under its Good Choices pillar, which includes a commitment to cutting alcohol-inflicted harm and promoting responsible drinking, Bacardi notes that demand is growing for no- and low-alcohol drinks \u201cas consumer adopt a more mindful approach to alcohol consumption\u201d, and that it \u201ccontinue[s] to deliver something for everyone\u201d within its portfolio. In 2021, the Aberfeldy distiller also worked outside of brand extensions with the pilot of its brand Palette. Speaking to Just Drinks earlier this year , the company\u2019s head of innovation for western Europe, Marine Rozenfeld explained that the range would remain in France for now, noting that the group was mainly centring in on its alcohol-free Martini range. Rozenfeld also spoke of how the group was seeing \u201cthe most traction\u201d in lower alcohol options like its St Germain liqueur brand, which the company snapped up in 2013. It has also owned the lower-alcohol vermouth brand Martini Rosso since 1993. \u201cI think the products that enable you to make low alcohol [choices], like the St Germain spritz, [are] going to get more traction. [I\u2019m] finding that middle ground in the low space is getting more traction than the no, versus what I\u2019ve seen before\u201d, she said. Molson Coors Increasing the level of non-alcoholic offerings is a key part of Canadian-American brewing giant Molson Coors\u2019 strategy as well. While the group doesn\u2019t have a specific growth target for non-alc, the category does sit under its aims for its Beyond Beer portfolio, which includes flavoured hard seltzers, hard teas, spirts and its non-alcoholic products. The Chicago-headquartered brewer\u2019s non-alc line features alcohol-free beer brand extensions for Blue Moon and Coors and non-alc ready-to-drink cocktails. As part of its Acceleration Plan, brought into force in October 2023, Molson Coors is planning to \u201cscale and expand\u201d its Beyond Beer portfolio, and plans to have the range producing \u201cabout half of its Above Premium net sales revenue growth over the medium term\u201d. Naked Life. Credit: Naked Life In September, the group also announced plans to partner with Australian non-alcoholic cocktail brand Naked Life, to help it launch in the US. The Coors Light brewer is to put five Naked Life cocktail drinks on the US market in 2025: the negroni spritz, margarita, gin & tonic, cosmopolitan and mojito variants. At the start of 2023, the MillerLite brand owner also launched a non-alcoholic RTD called Roxie in the US. The range includes three SKUs in the flavours Forbidden Pineapple, Lost in the Mango and Ripe with Passionfruit. Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) While non-alcoholic wine remains an emerging market, Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) is among the major producers of conventional wine showing interest in the area. The Mo\u00ebt et Chandon Champagne producer has made a recent move to dip its toe into the sector. At the start of October, the Veuve Clicquot Champagne producer a cquired a minority shareholding in France\u2019s alcohol-free sparkling wine brand French Bloom. The group does not produce any non-alcoholic brand extensions or independent brands itself. The brand was co-founded by Constance Jablonski and Maggie Frerejean-Taittinger in 2019, and currently sells its multi-SKUs range to 32 markets, including the US, Canada, UK, Australia and UAE. French Bloom. Credit: French Bloom Commenting on the move at the time, CEO of LVMH\u2019s wine and spirits division Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Philippe Schaus said: \u201cThis investment aligns with Mo\u00ebt Hennessy\u2019s key strategic initiatives, demonstrating our commitment to offering high-quality alcohol-free choices to consumers who moderate their alcohol intake. \u201cWe are confident that our expertise in wines and spirits, combined with French Bloom team\u2019s exceptional innovation and visionary leadership, will enable us to craft the future of this category.\u201d Speaking to Just Drinks in May, French Bloom co-founder Frerejean-Taittinger said around \u201c80% of our customers\u201d in the markets where the company does business \u201care actually individuals who enjoy both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages interchangeably throughout their evenings, weeks, or months\u201d. She added: \u201cThey are \u2018flexi-drinkers\u2019 and interestingly, our core clientele reflect where I believe the wine market is going: drinking higher quality but less often.\u201d Heineken When it comes to ventures in non-alcoholic beer, Heineken has been a long-standing player. The Dutch brewing major launched its 0.0 variant of its namesake drink in 2017 in the Netherlands and and Germany. Today, it is sold in more than 110 markets across Europe, North America, Africa and Asia-Pacific. Heineken also manufacturers other non-alcoholic beer brand extensions, such as Sol Zero, Amstel Oro 0.0 and Birra Moretto Zero. The group has also sought to offer its namesake non-alc brew on tap. It launched Heineken 0.0 on draught in the UK in 2021 and has a goal to have the same number of taps in pubs as there are taps of Heineken Original by 2025. It is also in the process of building draught listings in European markets including France, Italy, Spain and Germany. To facilitate the push of putting 0.0 on draught, the Desperados producer developed an eight-litre Blade keg and 20-litre David unit. The company says the unit has a proprietary \u2018BlueBird\u2019 cooling innovation that helps to prevent the fermentation of alcohol-free beer once a keg is attached to a tap. Heineken 0.0. Credit: BORIMAT PRAOKAEW/Shutterstock In October 2024 , the Amstel brewer said it was still confident in the potential of its non-alcoholic business despite booking a 3.4% rise in volume sales in the third quarter of the year compared to the 14% seen in the first half. When asked by Bernstein analyst Trevor Stirling whether the company thought the slowing growth indicated a \u201cpermanent change in momentum\u201d, CFO Harold van den Broek said: \u201cIt was just a matter of not being at the right place, at the right time, with the right investment in some of these markets but nothing that structurally worries us. We do believe that this will pick up in the quarters to come.\u201d Speaking to analysts,\u00a0van den Broek said non-alcoholic beer brands made up roughly 4% of the company's global beer sales. He added that \u201cover the next foreseeable future\u201d the group expected the size of its zero range to increase \u201cto about 6% or 7% of our total portfolio\u201d. In January 2025, Heineken published new research in collaboration with Ipsos and University of Oxford around consumer attitudes to low-and-no-alcohol. The study, which includes responses from 11,800 people across the UK, the US, Spain, Japan and Brazil, found four in five consumers believe it is more acceptable to buy no-and-low-alcohol than five years ago but that peer pressure is holding back sales. Over 80% of respondents said they believe drinking no-and-low options is more acceptable than years ago. More than two-thirds (68%) of respondents across the five countries reported they had tried no-and-low products. Some\u00a09% of respondents said they associated non-alcoholic drinkers with being \u2018cool\u2019 and 25% with being \u2018respectable\u2019. Meanwhile, 4% said they thought they were \u2018uncool\u2019 and 6% said they were \u2018boring\u2019. Commenting on the research, Heineken chief corporate affairs officer Joanna Price said the results of the study showed \"acceptability of 0.0 beer is at an all-time high\", but that \"social stigmas still hinder our vision that everyone should always have a choice and should not be held back from choosing 0.0.\u201d Concha y Toro Chilean wine giant Concha y Toro announced its entry into the non-alcoholic segment in December 2024 with Casillero del Diablo Zero in the UK. The alcohol-free sparkling wine alternative is made from 100% Chardonnay grapes grown in Chile's Central Valley region. The Trivento owner said it spent around a year developing the \"gently dealcoholised\" product through \u201cextensive trials\u201d led by Casillero winemaker Max Weinlaub. To begin with, the new product is being sold in the UK but Concha y Toro told Just Drinks expanding the product into other markets was \"very likely in 2025\". The wine is being distributed by UK wholesalers, including Filshill, Imperial and Bestway, and independent retailers. The company told Just Drinks it had also received \u201csome very positive feedback from a number of supermarkets\u201d in the UK and was in the process of \u201cworking on timescales\u201d. The launch of the non-alcoholic wine follows on from the launch of low-alcohol 8.5% abv Casillero del Diablo BeLight in 2023. The product is sold in some Latin American markets as well as UK and Europe. Concha y Toro's entry into alcohol-free didn't seem a likely move in 2023 when the group's technical director and winemaker Marcelo Papa told a group of journalists in London that making \u201cenjoyable\u201d non-alcoholic wines was the \u201cbiggest challenge for the wine industry\u201d . \"Drinks giants\u2019 moves in no-and-low alcohol\" was originally created and published by Just Drinks , a GlobalData owned brand.

FUND #1 RANKING MORNINGSTAR CATEGORY FOR 2024 PR Newswire Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 7:30 PM 4 min read DYMIX employs innovative structure and approach to lead all Macro Trading funds ROCKVILLE, Md. , Jan. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Dynamic Wealth Group (DWG) announced that its Dynamic Alpha Macro Fund (DYMIX) was the #1 performing fund for 2024 in the Morningstar Macro Trading category (60 funds). Launched in July 2023 , the fund combines two non-correlated strategies; a fundamental, global macro strategy paired with a balanced portfolio of US equities to help deliver a return stream that is uncorrelated to the broader market. \"Leading the category for 2024 is an indication that our process and methodology is working and that DYMIX can be a valuable tool for most investors' portfolios,\" said Bradley Barrie , Managing Director and Chief Investment Officer of DWG. \"We believe in multidimensional portfolio construction in hopes of providing a smoother investing experience for clients.\" The equity securities strategy invests in exchange traded funds that seek to provide low-cost broad market exposure. The futures trading strategy invests in long and short futures positions that seek to provide diversified return potential. The futures positions can include currencies, debt, equities, energy, metals, or agriculture. By combining the two strategies, DWG believes the fund can deliver a smoother investing experience compared to equity-only strategies. \"We are thrilled that DYMIX is being recognized so quickly by the industry. The Dynamic Wealth Group is an impressive team that brings a refreshing approach and real results to the investing community,\" said Catherine Ayers-Rigsby , president of Advisors Preferred.
