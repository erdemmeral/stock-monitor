[{"text": "FDA approves IV maintenance dosing of Leqembi\u00ae (lecanemab-irmb) for the treatment of early Alzheimer's Disease in the US PR Newswire Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 5:53 AM 7 min read In This Article: BRCTF +2.12% STOCKHOLM , Jan. 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- BioArctic AB (publ) (NASDAQ STOCKHOLM : BIOA B) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved BioArctic's partner Eisai's Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Leqembi as a once every four weeks intravenous (IV) maintenance dosing. Leqembi is indicated for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia stage of disease in the U.S. (early Alzheimer's disease). This approval means that patients who have completed the biweekly initiation phase of 18 months have the option to transition to a once every four weeks 10 mg/kg dosing regimen. Eisai has previously published data supporting the importance of continued ongoing treatment. Data from the off-treatment period between the Phase 2 core study and its long-term extension (LTE) showed that discontinuation of treatment is associated with reaccumulation of brain amyloid, and plasma and CSF biomarkers, and reversion to placebo rate of clinical decline. [1] In addition, recent data of three years of bi-weekly treatment across the Phase 3 Clarity AD core study and LTE, showed that Leqembi reduced cognitive decline on the CDR-SB by -0.95 relative to a matched natural history cohort \u2013 more than double the mean change from baseline relative to placebo on the CDR-SB at 18 months (-0.45) \u2013 showing expanded clinical and personally meaningful benefit for early AD patients. [2] Alzheimer's disease is caused by a continuous underlying neurotoxic process that begins before and continues after plaque removal. Continuous administration of Leqembi is of great value to patients as Leqembi works to fight Alzheimer's Disease in two ways: not only rapidly clearing the amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) plaque, but it also works to fight the progressive nature of Alzheimer's disease by continuously clearing the highly toxic protofibrils that otherwise continue to cause neuronal injury. The sBLA for the once every 4-week dosing regimen is based on modeling of observed data from the Phase 2 study and its long-term extension (LTE) as well as the Clarity AD study and its LTE study. Modeling simulations predict that transitioning to once every 4 weeks maintenance dosing after 18 months of biweekly treatment will maintain clinical and biomarker benefits of therapy. Leqembi is already approved in the US, Japan , China , Great Britain and several other markets. In November 2024 , the treatment received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommending approval. Eisai has submitted applications for approval of lecanemab in 17 countries and regions. Furthermore, the FDA accepted Eisai's Supplemental Biologics License (BLA) for the Leqembi subcutaneous autoinjector for weekly maintenance dosing in January 2025 and set a PDUFA action date for August 31, 2025 . Story Continues Leqembi is the result of a long-standing collaboration between BioArctic and Eisai, and the antibody was originally developed by BioArctic based on the work of Professor Lars Lannfelt and his discovery of the Arctic mutation in Alzheimer's disease. Eisai is responsible for the clinical development, applications for market approval and commercialization of Lecanemab for Alzheimer's disease. BioArctic has the right to jointly commercialize Leqembi in the Nordic region, pending European approval, and currently Eisai and BioArctic are preparing for a joint commercialization in the region.

It is a humanized immunoglobulin gamma 1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody directed against aggregated soluble (protofibril) and insoluble forms of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2). Lecanemab is approved in the U.S., Japan , Great Britain , China , and several other markets for the treatment of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild AD dementia. Lecanemab's approvals in these countries, as well as the CHMP's positive opinion, were primarily based on Phase 3 data from Eisai's global Clarity AD clinical trial, in which it met its primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints with statistically significant results. The most common adverse events (>10%) in the lecanemab group were infusion reactions, ARIA-H (combined cerebral microhemorrhages, cerebral macrohemorrhages, and superficial siderosis), ARIA-E (edema/effusion), headache, and fall. Eisai has also submitted applications for regulatory approval of lecanemab in several other countries and regions, including the European Union. In November 2024 , the treatment received positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommending approval. In January 2025 , the rolling submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for maintenance dosing of a subcutaneous auto injection formulation, which is being developed to enhance convenience for patients, was accepted in the U.S., with PDUFA date August 31, 2025 . Since July 2020 , Eisai's Phase 3 clinical study (AHEAD 3-45) with lecanemab in individuals with preclinical AD, meaning they are clinically normal and have intermediate or elevated levels of amyloid in their brains, is ongoing. The study was fully recruited in October 2024 . AHEAD 3-45 is a four-year study conducted as a public-private partnership between the Alzheimer's Clinical Trial Consortium that provides the infrastructure for academic clinical trials in AD and related dementias in the U.S, funded by the National Institute on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health and Eisai. Since January 2022 , the Tau NexGen clinical study for Dominantly Inherited AD (DIAD), that is conducted by Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU), led by Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis , is ongoing and includes lecanemab as the backbone anti-amyloid therapy.

stumble, BioAge reconnects with its longevity pipeline PharmaVoice, an Industry Dive publication \u00b7 Pharma Voice \u00b7 Industry Dive Alexandra Pecci Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 11:00 AM 4 min read In This Article: BIOA +2.61% NVS +0.73% This story was originally published on PharmaVoice . To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily PharmaVoice newsletter . BioAge Labs is returning to its aging roots after a failed attempt in obesity R&D. To get the ball rolling again, the biotech has entered into a multi-year research collaboration worth up to $550 million with Novartis to identify and validate drug targets related to aging, specifically around exercise biology. Since its founding a decade ago, BioAge has targeted what it calls the \u201cbiology of human aging.\u201d It hopped on the obesity bandwagon with azelaprag, a small molecule pill that became its lead candidate. However, BioAge\u2019s obesity bet didn\u2019t pay off. The company discontinued its azelaprag trial in December after phase 2 data raised liver-related safety concerns, a move that CEO and co-founder Kristen Fortney called a \u201csignificant disappointment\u201d in a press release announcing the program\u2019s discontinuation. Although Fortney said the idea that BioAge is now going back to its aging roots is \u201cone way of thinking about it,\u201d she noted that every target, including obesity, is drawn from its AI-driven discovery platform . \u201cOur focus has always been on those molecular mechanisms of healthy aging, and of course once you get to clinical development and you\u2019re focused on a particular indication, like obesity, you can forget the genesis,\u201d she said. \u201cBut those were also targets that emerged from the platform originally.\u201d As part of its Novartis partnership, BioAge will tap that platform, which analyzes longitudinal data from a human biobank, along with detailed health records, \u201cto identify and validate multiple novel therapeutic drug targets,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe are looking for targets that haven't been developed before.\" Kristen Fortney CEO, co-founder, BioAge Labs \u201cThey're one of the pharma companies excited about the potential of aging biology to bring us new targets to treat disease,\u201d Fortney said, pointing to Novartis\u2019 newly formed Diseases of Aging and Regenerative Medicine Group , noting they \u201chave very interesting human data sets of their own.\u201d A key element of the partnership is identifying the \u201cmolecular mediators of the benefits of exercise.\u201d Exercise can influence gene expression, but \u201cas you get older, your capacity to exercise goes down, and often your body's response to exercise goes down,\u201d Fortney said. \u201cIs there some other way you can induce gene changes to recapitulate some of the best benefits of exercise with a pill, with a drug?\u201d she asked. While the partnership is still in early stages and BioAge hasn\u2019t disclosed targets, Fortney said the company will choose to focus on those with a \u201cstrong link between the target and positive metabolic aging outcomes in our human cohort data and [where] we believe there\u2019s indications in the metabolic sphere where these targets could have applications.\u201d Leer m\u00e1s Fortney said another key element of the partnership is a drive for new approaches. \u201cWe are looking for targets that haven't been developed before,\u201d she said. What\u2019s next With so many companies flooding the obesity space, BioAge\u2019s stumble will likely be among the first of more to come. Amgen\u2019s obesity candidate, MariTide, squeaked through mid-stage development with phase 2 results that matched its potential competitors Zepbound and Wegovy, but indicated a potentially higher dropout rate among patients. Despite plans to advance into phase 3, the news sent shares tumbling in November. And BioAge\u2019s azelaprag saga isn\u2019t over. The biotech now faces a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege they were misled about the company\u2019s future. BioAge abandoned the azelaprag trial less than three months after closing an IPO in October. Fortney declined to comment on the lawsuit. The company also said it will \u201cshare updated plans for azelaprag\u201d in the first quarter of 2025. Meanwhile, BioAge is looking to the future. In addition to the Novartis partnership, Fortney said the company will file an IND for its internally discovered NLRP3 inhibitors by the end of this year and move into the clinic. \u201cNLRP3 is an immune and brain aging target strongly linked to human longevity in our human data,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's a target that shows promise in many different indications, from metabolic aging to brain aging.\u201d Fortney also remains optimistic about the platform and the company\u2019s work. \u201cWe have a lot of promising targets we want to advance for different indications related to metabolic aging,\u201d she said.

Biologics License Application for subcutaneous maintenance dosing of Leqembi\u00ae (lecanemab-irmb) in the US PR Newswire Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 5:51 AM 6 min read In This Article: BRCTF +2.12% STOCKHOLM , Jan. 14, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- BioArctic AB (publ) (Nasdaq Stockholm: BIOA B) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted BioArctic's partner Eisai's Biologics License Application (BLA) for Leqembi subcutaneous autoinjector (SC-AI) for weekly maintenance dosingLeqembi is indicated for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or mild dementia stage of disease (collectively referred to as early AD). Leqembi is the only FDA-approved anti-amyloid therapy that potentially could offer the convenience of a subcutaneous injection with at-home administration option. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date has been set to August 31, 2025 . The BLA is based on data from the Clarity AD (Study 301) open-label extension (OLE) and modeling of observed data. If LEQEMBI subcutaneous maintenance dosing is approved by the FDA, LEQEMBI will be the only treatment for AD that can be administered subcutaneously at home using an autoinjector (AI). The injection process is expected to take, on average, 15 seconds. The SC-AI 360 mg weekly maintenance regimen will allow patients who have completed the biweekly intravenous (IV) initiation phase, exact period under discussion with the FDA, to receive weekly doses that are expected to maintain the clinical and biomarker benefits. The SC-AI is expected to be simple and easy for patients and their care partners to use, and may reduce the need for hospital or infusion site visits and nursing care for IV administration, which will make it easier to continue maintenance administration and may contribute to further simplifying the treatment pathway for AD. Leqembi is already approved in the US, Japan , China , Great Britain and other markets. In November 2024 , the treatment received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommending approval. The information was released for public disclosure, through the agency of the contact persons below, on January 14, 2025 , at 01.00 CET. For further information, please contact: Oskar Bosson , VP Communications and IR E-mail: oskar.bosson@bioarctic.se Phone: +46 70 410 71 80 About lecanemab (Leqembi \u00ae ) Lecanemab is the result of a strategic research alliance between BioArctic and Eisai. It is a humanized immunoglobulin gamma 1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody directed against aggregated soluble (protofibril) and insoluble forms of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2). Lecanemab is approved in the U.S., Japan , China , and several other markets for the treatment of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild AD dementia. Lecanemab's approvals in these countries, as well as the CHMP's positive opinion, were primarily based on Phase 3 data from Eisai's global Clarity AD clinical trial, in which it met its primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints with statistically significant results. The most common adverse events (>10%) in the lecanemab group were infusion reactions, ARIA-H (combined cerebral microhemorrhages, cerebral macrohemorrhages, and superficial siderosis), ARIA-E (edema/effusion), headache, and fall. Story Continues Eisai has also submitted applications for regulatory approval of lecanemab in several other countries and regions, including the European Union. In November 2024 , the treatment received positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommending approval. A supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for less frequent intravenous maintenance dosing was accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2024 , with PDUFA date January 25, 2025 . In January 2025 , the rolling submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for maintenance dosing of a subcutaneous injection formulation, which is being developed to enhance convenience for patients, was accepted in the U.S.. Since July 2020 , Eisai's Phase 3 clinical study (AHEAD 3-45) with lecanemab in individuals with preclinical AD, meaning they are clinically normal and have intermediate or elevated levels of amyloid in their brains, is ongoing. The study was fully recruited in October 2024 . AHEAD 3-45 is a four-year study conducted as a public-private partnership between the Alzheimer's Clinical Trial Consortium that provides the infrastructure for academic clinical trials in AD and related dementias in the U.S, funded by the National Institute on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health and Eisai. Since January 2022 , the Tau NexGen clinical study for Dominantly Inherited AD (DIAD), that is conducted by Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU), led by Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis , is ongoing and includes lecanemab as the backbone anti-amyloid therapy.

(BIOA) Loses -67.99% in 4 Weeks, Here's Why a Trend Reversal May be Around the Corner Zacks Equity Research Thu, Jan 2, 2025, 5:35 PM 2 min read In This Article: BIOA +2.61% BioAge Labs, Inc. (BIOA) has been beaten down lately with too much selling pressure. While the stock has lost 68% over the past four weeks, there is light at the end of the tunnel as it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts expect the company to report better earnings than they predicted earlier. Guide to Identifying Oversold Stocks We use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30. Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal. So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound. However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision. Why BIOA Could Bounce Back Before Long The RSI reading of 27.57 for BIOA is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand. 3-month RSI Chart for BIOA The RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term. On the fundamental side, there has been strong agreement among the sell-side analysts covering the stock in raising earnings estimates for the current year. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for BIOA has increased 39.6%. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term. Moreover, BIOA currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

(BIOA): A Bull Case Theory Ricardo Pillai Fri, Dec 27, 2024, 5:18 PM 3 min read In This Article: BIOA +2.61% We came across a bullish thesis on BioAge Labs, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIOA) on Value Investing Subreddit Page by value1024. In this article, we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on BIOA. BioAge Labs, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIOA)'s share was trading at $5.88 as of Dec 26 th . A clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company's boardroom, emphasizing the importance of decision-making for the lead candidate development of a once-daily oral tablet. BioAge Labs (NASDAQ:BIOA), a recent IPO in the biotech sector, has experienced significant volatility, dropping 75% from its $20 debut to around $6 last week. Despite the lack of revenue, the company maintains a $220M market cap and boasts over $9 per share in cash, providing runway until 2029. The sharp decline was driven by the termination of a clinical trial for its Azelaprag obesity drug, developed in collaboration with Eli Lilly, leading to investor concerns. However, the market seems to have misunderstood BIOA\u2019s broader potential, as the company is far from a single-drug entity. BIOA recently announced a transformative partnership with Novartis, a global pharmaceutical giant with over $45B in annual sales. The collaboration aims to discover therapies for age-related diseases and includes $20M in upfront payments and research funding, along with up to $530M in potential milestone payments. This deal underscores Novartis's confidence in BIOA\u2019s proprietary platform, which leverages exclusive access to longitudinal human aging cohorts spanning up to 50 years. This dataset, combined with advanced AI and machine learning, identifies determinants of healthy lifespan, positioning BIOA as a key player in therapeutic discovery. The partnership could lead to further integration or even an acquisition, although BIOA\u2019s substantial cash reserves make an early buyout unlikely. The market\u2019s initial reaction overlooked the strategic value of BIOA\u2019s platform and data assets, which are critical for advancing research in age-related diseases. Investors such as Hunterbrook Capital have recognized this mispricing, as reflected in increased stock demand and strong performance last week. The collaboration with Novartis validates BIOA\u2019s approach, providing a significant cash infusion and aligning it with a top-tier partner. At current levels, BIOA presents a compelling risk-reward profile, combining substantial cash reserves, cutting-edge data capabilities, and a high-profile partnership. The stock is positioned to attract institutional interest, making it a potential multibagger as its platform gains recognition. While past setbacks have overshadowed its strengths, BIOA now offers a unique opportunity for investors seeking undervalued assets with transformative growth potential.
