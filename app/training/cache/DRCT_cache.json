GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with DRCT. Q : Can you discuss the confidence in the marketplace after the tumultuous period, including the auditor change and the analytics report? A : Mark Walker, CEO: Confidence is being restored both in financial markets and with our partners. The quick transition to BDO as our auditor and timely public filings have helped. In the marketplace, feedback from major partners has been favorable, and buying patterns are picking up momentum. Many partners have stuck by us, and we're seeing incremental growth in spending levels each month. Q : How does the diversification strategy look now, especially with the focus on third-party DSPs? A : Mark Walker, CEO: The total addressable market (TAM) remains the same, but the delivery mechanism is evolving. On the buy side, we're targeting new markets to increase our customer base.

We see opportunities to leverage partners for curation, and you'll hear more about this from us soon. Q : Can you elaborate on the cost optimization strategy and when we might see results? A : Diana Diaz, CFO: We made staffing reductions and paused hiring to manage costs. We also reduced discretionary spending while rebuilding. We aim to remain lean as we rebuild over the next year, focusing on efficiency. Q : What are the fixed cost implications of scaling infrastructure, particularly on the sell side? A : Mark Walker, CEO: Our business model allows us to scale up or down based on demand, which has helped us adjust costs and reach profitability faster.

Digital Holdings Reports Q3 2024 Financial Results PR Newswire Wed, Nov 13, 2024, 12:01 AM In This Article: DRCT -4.17% Company Launches Colossus Connections to Accelerate\u00a0Direct Integration Efforts with Leading Demand-Side Platforms New Unified Buy-Side Operating Structure Creates Additional Business Lines and Revenue Opportunities Company to Host Conference Call at 5:00 PM ET Today HOUSTON , Nov. 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0Direct Digital Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: DRCT) (\"Direct Digital Holdings\" or the \"Company\"), a leading advertising and marketing technology platform operating through its companies Colossus Media, LLC (\"Colossus SSP\") and Orange 142, LLC (\"Orange 142\"), today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 . Mark D. Walker , Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"The past few quarters have presented significant challenges for our company due to a targeted and defamatory disinformation campaign. We describe this as disinformation not only because it contained factual inaccuracies, but also because it omitted key insights and context that would have clarified our business practices. As a result, Direct Digital Holdings experienced an unexpected business disruption among our partners, advertisers, and clients, including a major customer who paused its connection with our supply-side platform, Colossus SSP, which led to a temporary reduction in our revenues.\" Walker continued, \"We moved swiftly to address these claims, working closely with all of our partners to ensure they understood the truth of our practices and taking legal action against the author of the defamatory claims. Our paused customer has since restored its connection, with volumes through our sell-side platform steadily increasing, though not yet fully returned to previous levels. Throughout this, we have been working diligently with our multi-national HoldCo agencies, our Fortune 500 brand partners, and demand-side partners, to resume business, which many already have. While we are confident we will return the Company to normalcy, it will take time to rebuild. We are grateful for the resiliency and focus of our employees as they work to position us to rebound from these challenges.\" Revenues for the third quarter of 2024 were $9.1 million , consisting of $2.2 million in our sell-side advertising segment and $6.9 million in our buy-side advertising segment. The key driver for the reduction of our revenue from prior periods was the pause by our customer as described above. Keith Smith , President, commented, \"Our recently announced $20 million Equity Reserve Facility with New Circle Principal Investments provides us with enhanced financial flexibility to execute on our strategic initiatives while also strengthening our balance sheet. This new financing source will support both our technology investments and growth objectives as we continue to evolve our platform capabilities and position Direct Digital Holdings for sustainable, long-term growth.\" Story Continues Walker added, \"Over these past few months, we have innovated and optimized our business and are now in a position of strength, well-situated to capitalize on several of our key growth initiatives. Direct Digital Holdings' technology platform, diversified client base, optimized cost structure and new financing sources allow us to expand into new industry verticals, accelerate our direct integrations with leading demand-side platforms, advance our technological capabilities across our business and maintain our commitment to bringing underrepresented publishers into the programmatic ecosystem.\" Advancing Innovation for Colossus\u00a0SSP The Company expects to make investments to drive technological advancements for Direct Digital Holdings' supply-side platform, Colossus SSP, including the launch of Colossus Connections, an aggressive initiative the Company is already executing to accelerate direct integrations with leading demand platforms. This initiative will aim to unlock direct access to more demand partners and revenue, while optimizing transaction costs and efficiency for Colossus SSP and its clients. As a result of Colossus Connections, the Company has already signed two of the leading demand-side partners, with those direct connections expected to go live in 2025. Additionally, for Colossus SSP, the Company is developing new curation and segment-based products in areas such as carbon, attention, and media quality, which are in high-demand among advertisers. The Company is also expanding efforts to bring underrepresented publishers and creators into the programmatic ecosystem, with their unique and premium inventory available through Colossus SSP. Enhancing Growth on the Demand Side On the demand-side, the Company expects that funding will support the recently announced unification of Direct Digital Holdings' buy-side divisions, Orange 142 and Huddled Masses. This will enable the delivery of new capabilities, particularly in helping clients navigate emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as emerging, high-growth channels such as marketing-enabled services, connected TV, social media and retail media. Small- and mid-sized clients will be a key focus for the combined entity, as these clients are increasingly shifting advertising budgets to digital and require support to navigate its complexities and optimize their ad spend. Currently, the Company serves hundreds of small- and mid-sized clients, enabling over 2,000 campaigns each year. Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights: For the third quarter of 2024, revenue was $9.1 million , a decrease of $50.4 million , or an 85% decline compared to the $59.5 million in the same period of 2023. Sell-side advertising segment revenue fell to $2.2 million compared to $51.6 million in the same period of 2023, 96% decrease year-over-year. As described above, the key driver for this reduction was the suspension by one of our large customers following the defamatory article against the Company, and this customer has since restored its connection. Buy-side advertising segment revenue fell to $6.9 million compared to $7.9 million in the same period of 2023, a 12% year-over-year decline. Gross profit was $3.5 million , or 39% of revenue, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $11.8 million , or 20% of revenue, in the same period of 2023. Operating expenses were $7.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of $0.1 million , or 1%, over $7.3 million in the same period of 2023. Consolidated operating loss was $3.7 million , compared to operating income of $4.5 million in the same period of 2023, a decrease of $8.2 million or 181%. Net loss was $6.4 million in the third quarter, compared to net income of $3.4 million in the same period of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA (1) was a loss of $2.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to positive Adjusted EBITDA of $5.4 million in the same period of 2023. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company held cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 million compared to $5.1 million as of December 31, 2023 . (1) \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is a non-GAAP financial measure. The section titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below describes our usage of non-GAAP financial measures and provides reconciliations between historical GAAP and non-GAAP information contained in this press release. Financial Outlook Assuming the U.S. economy does not experience any major economic conditions that deteriorate or otherwise significantly reduce advertiser demand, and subject to certain uncertainties related to the ramp-up of our businesses and general market conditions, Direct Digital Holdings is providing full-year revenue guidance of $60 million to $70 million for FY 2024 and full-year revenue guidance of $90 million to $110 million for FY 2025 as the Company rebuilds to previous levels. Diana Diaz , Chief Financial Officer, stated, \"As we move forward, we are pleased to return to a normal cadence of reporting our financial results which will provide our investors with the timely and accurate information they deserve. We're committed to delivering sustainable growth for our investors while offering our partners industry-leading marketing and advertising capabilities.\" Smith added, \"While Direct Digital Holdings is working to overcome these recent challenges, defamatory disinformation attacks go far beyond the advertising technology industry, distorting public perception, manipulating stock prices, often to the disadvantage of everyday investors, and stifling innovation. The weaponization of disinformation is posing a profound risk to small and up-and-coming businesses such as ours, and calls for a deeper dive into this pernicious and increasingly ubiquitous issue and an appropriate systemic response.\" Conference Call and Webcast Details Direct Digital will host a conference call on Tuesday, November 12, 2024 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company's third quarter 2024 financial results.

We use words such as \"could,\" \"would,\" \"may,\" \"might,\" \"will,\" \"expect,\" \"likely,\" \"believe,\" \"continue,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"project\" and other similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements, but not all forward-looking statements include these words. All of our forward-looking statements involve estimates and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, any such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the information described under the caption \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10 K (the \"Form 10-K\") and subsequent periodic and or current reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our industry experience and our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. As you read and consider this press release, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties (many of which are beyond our control) and assumptions. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual operating and financial performance and cause our performance to differ materially from the performance expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. We believe these factors include, but are not limited to, the following: conditions to our ability to sell Class A common stock under our equity reserve facility; the restrictions and covenants imposed upon us by our credit facilities; the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may hinder our ability to obtain future financing; our ability to secure additional financing to meet our capital needs; our ineligibility to file short-form registration statements on Form S-3, which may impair our ability to raise capital; our failure to satisfy applicable listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market resulting in a potential delisting of our common stock; failure to remedy any listing deficiencies noted in the deficiency letters from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC; the risk that the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC does not accept the Company's plan to regain compliance with applicable rules to maintain its listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market; costs, risks and uncertainties related to the restatement of certain prior period financial statements; any significant fluctuations caused by our high customer concentration; risks related to non-payment by our clients; reputational and other harms caused by our failure to detect advertising fraud ; operational and performance issues with our platform, whether real or perceived, including a failure to respond to technological changes or to upgrade our technology systems; restrictions on the use of third-party \"cookies,\" mobile device IDs or other tracking technologies, which could diminish our platform's effectiveness; unfavorable publicity and negative public perception about our industry, particularly concerns regarding data privacy and security relating to our industry's technology and practices, and any perceived failure to comply with laws and industry self-regulation; our failure to manage our growth effectively; the difficulty in identifying and integrating any future acquisitions or strategic investments; any changes or developments in legislative, judicial, regulatory or cultural environments related to information collection, use and processing; challenges related to our buy-side clients that are destination marketing organizations and that operate as public/private partnerships; any strain on our resources or diversion of our management's attention as a result of being a public company; the intense competition of the digital advertising industry and our ability to effectively compete against current and future competitors; any significant inadvertent disclosure or breach of confidential and/or personal information we hold, or of the security of our or our customers', suppliers' or other partners' computer systems; as a holding company, we depend on distributions from Direct Digital Holdings, LLC (\"DDH LLC\") to pay our taxes, expenses (including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement) and any amount of any dividends we may pay to the holders of our common stock; the fact that DDH LLC is controlled by DDM, whose interest may differ from those of our public stockholders; any failure by us to maintain or implement effective internal controls or to detect fraud ; and other factors and assumptions discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent periodic and current reports we may file with the SEC. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect, our actual operating and financial performance may vary in material respects from the performance projected in these forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement contained in this press release to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances, and we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. New factors that could cause our business not to develop as we expect emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. Further, we cannot assess the impact of each currently known or new factor on our results of operations or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

FINANCIAL MEASURES In addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), including, in particular operating income, net cash provided by operating activities, and net income, we believe that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), as adjusted for loss on early termination of line of credit, revaluation of tax receivable agreement liability and stock-based compensation (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"), a non-GAAP financial measure, is useful in evaluating our operating performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA is net income (loss). In addition to operating income and net income, we use Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operational efficiency. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of our business and in understanding and evaluating our operating results for the following reasons: Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization, interest expense, provision for income taxes, stock-based compensation, revaluation of tax receivable agreement liability and certain one-time items such as acquisition costs, losses from early termination or redemption of credit agreements or preferred units and gains from settlements or loan forgiveness that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures and the method by which assets were acquired; Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of operating performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance; and Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, and also facilitates comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results. Our use of this non-GAAP financial measure has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) for each of the periods presented: NON-GAAP FINANCIAL METRICS (unaudited, in thousands) Three Months Ended

Program to Empower Underrepresented Publishers PR Newswire Wed, Nov 13, 2024, 6:48 PM 4 min read In This Article: DRCT -4.17% This program equips diverse publishers with essential resources to thrive in the evolving digital advertising landscape. HOUSTON , Nov. 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Colossus Media LLC (\"Colossus SSP\"), the inclusive supply-side advertising platform, today announced the launch of Momentum, a new initiative designed to support and empower underrepresented publishers in the programmatic advertising space. In line with the mission of its parent company, Direct Digital Holdings, Inc. ( NASDAQ: DRCT ), one of the few publicly traded Black-owned companies in the U.S., and the only Black-owned publicly traded advertising technology firm, the program addresses the challenges faced by diverse and underrepresented publishers, providing them with the tools, knowledge, and support necessary to succeed in a competitive and rapidly-evolving industry. \"Despite the significant growth and innovation within programmatic advertising, underrepresented, diverse publishers have not been provided the same resources and opportunities,\" said Lashawnda Goffin , CEO of Colossus SSP. \"Our mission with Momentum is to reshape the digital advertising landscape by empowering underrepresented publishers with the tools and opportunities they deserve. We're not just bridging the gap between advertisers and diverse publishers\u2014we're driving equity, innovation, and growth that will enable more diverse representation in digital media in the future.\" Participants in the Momentum program will benefit from a series of expertly curated courses covering key aspects of the programmatic ecosystem, including ad tech, data management, and advanced monetization strategies. These courses are designed and led by Colossus SSP's in-house subject matter experts (SMEs), ensuring participants receive top-tier education and guidance. As part of the program, participants gain exclusive access to demand via Colossus-led private marketplaces (PMPs). This allows publishers to tap into previously unavailable inventory opportunities and reach new, diverse audiences. \"We believe that diversity in digital advertising isn't just a moral imperative\u2014it's a business imperative,\" said Mark D. Walker , CEO at Direct Digital Holdings. \"Momentum is our pledge to amplify underrepresented voices in publishing by providing the support they need to thrive, it's not just a program\u2014it's a movement to level the playing field in digital advertising. By empowering these publishers, we're also supporting advertisers who are looking for high-quality diverse publishers to invest in and work with.\" Story Continues Momentum participants will also have the opportunity to connect with leading agencies, ad operations experts, and other industry professionals, through Colossus and Direct Digital Holdings. \"Participating in Momentum's program for diverse publishers to scale advertising access is a transformative step that is leveling the playing field for CultureBanx,\" said Kori Hale , CEO of CultureBanx, a multimedia organization redefining business, finance and tech news for minorities through music. \"This opportunity not only expands our advertising business but also enables us to create stronger, more sustainable growth avenues. By leveraging these resources, CultureBanx is empowered to compete on a larger scale, providing greater value to our audience and partners, while continuing to amplify underrepresented voices in business news.\" Yesterday, in support of Momentum's launch, Direct Digital Holdings and Colossus SSP also hosted an Ad Club New York panel highlighting the critical need to foster equity and innovation in the industry. The discussion explored how Momentum is reshaping the digital advertising landscape to amplify underrepresented voices.

Supply Path Efficiency for Advertisers PR Newswire Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 5:00 PM 4 min read In This Article: DRCT -4.17% New Colossus Connections initiative delivers on supply path optimization, while maximizing media budgets for advertisers HOUSTON , Nov. 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Colossus Media LLC (\"Colossus SSP\"), a subsidiary of the only Black-owned publicly traded advertising technology company, Direct Digital Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: DRCT), today announced the launch of Colossus Connections. This new initiative brings advanced direct integration capabilities to the company's supply-side platform (SSP). This program is designed to optimize supply path efficiency for advertisers through streamlined, direct connections with top demand-side platforms (DSPs), ensuring a more efficient, cost-effective, and impactful programmatic ecosystem. Colossus Connections enables Colossus SSP to establish and foster direct integrations with leading DSPs, reducing intermediaries and enhancing transparency and control for advertisers. By consolidating pathways between buyers and sellers, the initiative gives advertisers a clearer view of their media supply chain, ultimately driving more meaningful engagement and outcomes. In recent months, Colossus SSP has rapidly advanced its integration efforts, with two of the top 10 DSP partners already onboarded and expected to go live in 2025. \"Our goal with Colossus Connections is to simplify and elevate the ad delivery process by ensuring that every connection is valuable for advertisers and publishers,\" said Mark D. Walker , CEO and Co-Founder of Direct Digital Holdings. \"This program aligns with our commitment to provide premium programmatic solutions and to enhance value for advertisers by optimizing each step of the supply path.\" The importance of supply path optimization (SPO) continues to grow across the industry. According to IAS, 95% of ad buyers are implementing or planning to implement SPO technology next year. Colossus Connections directly responds to this demand, empowering advertisers with more efficient and transparent pathways to access digital inventory while supporting underrepresented publishers within the programmatic ecosystem. Reducing connections and streamlining SPO cuts down on the \"adtech tax\" by minimizing the number of intermediaries in the ad transaction process. Each intermediary takes a percentage of the ad spend, so a cleaner, more direct path reduces these fees. This efficiency allows a more significant share of the budget to reach publishers and ensures that advertisers' investments go further, creating a more cost-effective ecosystem for all parties. Story Continues This strategic initiative is supported by the recent $20 million Equity Reserve Facility with New Circle Principal Investments LLC, which provides Direct Digital Holdings with the flexibility to drive key growth initiatives across its platform. This financing will empower the continued development of Colossus Connections, enabling Direct Digital Holdings to invest in the technology and partnerships necessary to advance its SPO and integration efforts. \"The funding has enabled the expansion of our technology and strategic capabilities, benefiting both publishers and advertisers,\" said Walker. \"It also opens the door to new growth opportunities, like Colossus Connections.\" Founded in 2012, Colossus SSP, as part of Direct Digital Holdings, the only Black-owned, publicly-traded digital advertising technology business in the U.S., is dedicated to fostering diversity in the programmatic marketplace. Colossus SSP is the only minority-owned SSP on the public market, championing fair access for all publishers, regardless of size, ensuring they can attract advertiser budgets despite industry challenges like inventory minimums. By offering the tools, expertise, and customized marketplace solutions to support publishers and advertisers, Colossus SSP drives effective ad campaigns and helps brands and agencies meet diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) goals in their media buys.
