11% \u2014 they\u2019re attractively valued and provide growth upside to boot TipRanks Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 8:46 AM 7 min read In This Article: FBRT -0.86% BRSP -1.24% After two years of strong stock market performance, Wall Street is generally optimistic about 2025. But there is always a contrarian view \u2013 and in this case, it\u2019s laid out by hedge manager Bill Smead, who points out that the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds remains high and continues to edge back toward 5% \u2013 a move he believes will dampen enthusiasm for stocks. Invest with Confidence: Follow TipRanks' Top Wall Street Analysts to uncover their success rate and average return. Join thousands of data-driven investors \u2013 Build your Smart Portfolio for personalized insights. Smead argues that this reflects the market\u2019s anticipation of persistent inflation and higher interest rates. In the second half of 2024, the Fed reduced interest rates by 1% to counter easing inflationary pressures. Yet, as Smead observes, inflation remains stubbornly high, with annualized rates creeping back toward 3%. While inflation may not surge as it did three years ago, its persistence above the Fed\u2019s 2% target creates pressure to maintain higher interest rates. Historically, elevated rates have weighed on stock performance, and Smead suggests this dynamic could disrupt the ongoing bull market. So, how should investors respond? While stocks remain resilient for now, there are prudent strategies to hedge against potential downturns. Dividend stocks, for instance, are a classic defensive play and a smart way to diversify a portfolio. Their regular payments provide a reliable income stream, while the best dividend payers offer power yields capable of boosting the overall return. Against this backdrop, we\u2019ve opened up the TipRanks database to uncover details on two dividend payers with yields of about 11%, which have recently garnered praise from analysts. What\u2019s more, according to the analysts, these stocks also offer double-digit upside potential. Here\u2019s a closer look at these income-generating opportunities. Franklin BSP Realty Trust (FBRT) We\u2019ll start with Franklin BSP Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust, or REIT. These companies exist to invest in real properties of all sorts, either through direct funding of loans or through the purchase of mortgage-backed securities. Franklin BSP works on the former model, providing or servicing loans in the commercial real estate sector. The company has built up a portfolio primarily composed of first mortgage loans on multifamily residential properties \u2013 that is, the company is a mortgage lender for apartment complexes. As of the end of last September, Franklin BSP\u2019s portfolio included 157 loans, with an average loan size of $33 million. Of this, 74% was collateralized by multifamily properties. The remainder was secured by other types of commercial real estate, although the company has minimal exposure to office properties, which make up only 4% of the portfolio. Franklin BSP\u2019s investments are mainly in senior mortgage loans, which account for 99% of the total; 95% of the portfolio loans are set at floating rates. The core portfolio principal balance at the end of 3Q24 was $5.2 billion. Story Continues This makes for big business. In the third quarter of 2024, the last period reported, Franklin BSP closed $380 million in new loan commitments and funded $325 million of principal balance. At the same time, the company received $510 million in loan payments. The company\u2019s approach to loan origination is to tailor loans to specific properties \u2013 although it does stick to a profile on first mortgage loans. That profile includes loan sizes between $10 million and $250 million; up to an 80% loan-to-value ratio; a 3- to 5-year term for transitional loans; and a 10-year term for stabilized loans. Franklin BSP will consider any commercial property type, although, as noted, the company does lean toward multifamily residential properties. A primary aim in Franklin BSP\u2019s activity is to generate a stable income for investors. Which brings us to the dividend. Franklin BSP last declared its dividend on December 16 and paid it out on January 10. The common share dividend was set at $0.355, marking the twelfth payment in a row at that rate. The dividend annualizes to $1.42 per common share and gives a robust forward yield of 11.2%. The company backs up its dividend with strong liquidity. Franklin BSP reported $1.1 billion in total liquidity at the end of 3Q24, of which $346 million was in cash and cash equivalents. This REIT has caught the eye of Janney analyst Jason Stewart, who is impressed by Franklin BSP\u2019s overall position. Stewart says of the company, describing that position: \u201cFBRT operates one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector, has world-class sponsorship, and a peer-leading track record through a challenging CRE lending market. The company\u2019s origination platform has led the sector in activity and sets the company apart from peers. Current vintage loans will produce cyclically high ROEs, and with 36% of the portfolio in 2023/2024 vintage originations, the company is in a unique position to capitalize on the dislocation in the CRE lending market. Over time, we expect required returns for best-in-class CRE mortgage REITs to trend back to historical averages in the 8% \u2013 9% range.\u201d These comments support the analyst\u2019s Buy rating, while his $16 price target implies a ~29% upside potential on the one-year horizon. Together with the dividend yield, the total one-year return here is potentially 40%. (To watch Stewart\u2019s track record, click here ) Overall, FBRT shares have a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 3 unanimously positive Wall Street reviews. The shares are priced at $12.44, and their $15.50 average price target price suggests that the stock will gain ~25% over the next 12 months. (See FBRT stock forecast ) BrightSpire Capital (BRSP) For the second stock on our list, we\u2019ll look at another REIT, BrightSpire Capital. This is an internally managed REIT, with a $739 million market cap and a focus on building a diverse portfolio of commercial real estate assets. The company believes in economies of scale, aiming to leverage that for a competitive advantage. Getting into details, BrightSpire has a portfolio worth approximately $3.9 billion, and comprised of 76 loans. The loan segment, consisting of senior and mezzanine loans, makes up 80% of the total portfolio. The remaining 20% is mainly composed of net lease and other real estate transactions. Of the properties in the portfolio, 41% are multifamily dwellings, and 38% are office properties. The remainder is mostly composed of industrial spaces, hotels, and mixed-use properties. Geographically, BrightSpire is active in the US, mainly in the West (43% of the portfolio) and Southwest (28% of the portfolio). The company has a presence in the Northeast, at 14% of the portfolio, and 6% of its properties are located in Europe. We should note that BrightSpire\u2019s revenues and earnings have been trending downward in recent quarters. In the last period reported, 3Q24, the company had a bottom line of $0.21 per share, by non-GAAP measures. While the year-ago figure was 28 cents per share, the 3Q24 number beat the forecast by 2 cents per share. Even though it was slipping, the company\u2019s earnings were sufficient to support the common share dividend. BrightSpire last declared the dividend payment on December 16, and paid it out on January 15. The 16-cent dividend annualizes to 11.2%. For analyst Gaurav Mehta, covering this REIT for Alliance Global, the key point here is potential. He believes that BrightSpire is well-positioned to deliver improved results going forward, and that the dividend is a clear advantage. Mehta writes of the company, \u201cOur Buy rating is based on restart of new loan originations, management\u2019s focus on resolving watch list loans and REO assets, balance sheet with ample liquidity and a dividend yield of 11.2%. At the current valuation, we believe that risk/reward is skewed to the upside.\u201d Quantifying his stance, Mehta puts a Buy rating on BRSP shares, with a $7.25 price target that suggests the stock will gain ~30% in the next 12 months. With the dividend yield added in, that upside can reach 41%. (To watch Mehta\u2019s track record, click here ) There are 6 recent analyst reviews on file for BRPS shares, with a 4-to-2 split favoring Buy over Hold to give the stock its Moderate Buy consensus rating. The shares are currently trading for $5.59, and their $7.60 average price target, even more bullish than the Alliance Global view, points toward a gain of ~36% by early next year.

seen returns of 23% over the past three years editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Tue, Dec 17, 2024, 1:56 PM 3 min read In This Article: FBRT -0.86% For many investors, the main point of stock picking is to generate higher returns than the overall market. But if you try your hand at stock picking, you risk returning less than the market. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Franklin BSP Realty Trust, Inc. ( NYSE:FBRT ) shareholders, since the share price is down 10% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 32%. Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. See our latest analysis for Franklin BSP Realty Trust While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time. During the three years that the share price fell, Franklin BSP Realty Trust's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 30% each year. This fall in the EPS is worse than the 4% compound annual share price fall. This suggests that the market retains some optimism around long term earnings stability, despite past EPS declines. The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). NYSE:FBRT Earnings Per Share Growth December 17th 2024 We're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Franklin BSP Realty Trust's earnings, revenue and cash flow . What About Dividends? When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return . The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Franklin BSP Realty Trust the TSR over the last 3 years was 23%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments! A Different Perspective Franklin BSP Realty Trust shareholders are up 4.1% for the year (even including dividends). While you don't go broke making a profit, this return was actually lower than the average market return of about 29%. At least the longer term returns (running at about 7% a year, are better. We prefer focus on longer term returns, as they are usually a more meaningful indication of the underlying business. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Franklin BSP Realty Trust you should be aware of, and 1 of them is a bit unpleasant.

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Lindsey Crabbe, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Lindsey Crabbe Good morning. Thank you, Wyatt, for hosting our call today, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. With me on the call today are Richard Byrne, Chairman and CEO of FBRT; Jerry Baglien, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Operating Officer of FBRT; and Michael Comparato, President of FBRT. Before we begin, I want to mention that some of today's comments are forward-looking statements and are based on certain assumptions. Those comments and assumptions are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties as described in our most recently filed SEC periodic reports and actual future results may differ materially. The information conveyed on this call is current only as of the date of this call, November 5, 2024. The company assumes no obligation to update any statements made during this call, including any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings release and supplementary slide deck, each of which are available on our website at www.fbrtreit.com. We will refer to the supplementary slide deck on today's call. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rich Byrne. Richard Byrne Great. Thanks, Lindsey, and good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining us on this Election Day morning. As Lindsey mentioned, our earnings release and supplemental deck were published to our website yesterday. We're going to begin today's call on slide 4 by reviewing our third quarter results, and then we'll, as always, open the call to your questions. Also, as always, I will provide a brief overview of the quarter's key developments, and then Jerry will discuss our financial results, and Mike will cover market conditions, our watch list and our REO portfolio. With all that, let me start out with an overarching comment about how we, and probably mostly every CRE lender, thinks about the world. When we think about our portfolio, we think about it in two buckets. Loans originated during the Fed's zero interest rate policy and loans originated post the unprecedented rise in rates. The underlying metrics of most loans originated pre-rate hikes have, as you all know, deteriorated since underwriting as property values have declined and LTVs rose as a result of the dramatic increase in rates. The more serious problem, of course, with legacy loans has been and continues to be the significant deterioration in the office sector post COVID. Thankfully, our office exposure is now only 4% of our book. We received two full payoffs in office loans for $40 million in this quarter, and our pre-2024 originated traditional multi-tenant office exposure is now only $147 million or 2.6%. In addition to the notional exposure decreasing meaningfully quarter-over-quarter, the remaining office exposure has already been significantly marked down in prior quarters to reflect current market conditions. By contrast to the legacy loans, both office and non-office, the loans we're originating post rate hikes are among the highest quality, lowest loan-to-value loans we have seen in many years, and were originated at some of the highest spreads that we've seen in years. We continue to make significant progress turning over our book by originating new loans at current interest rates and valuations and cycling through our legacy book. In all, approximately 40%, that's 4%-0% of our portfolio, was originated after January 2023. We think this stat will be an extremely important metric for all CRE lenders because it measures the recycling of our book into these new relatively attractive loans set off of remarked property valuations. Our robust origination and repayment activity has resulted in over $1.6 billion of new loan commitments year-to-date. We are encouraged by repayments on our legacy portfolio this year. We've received $1 billion year-to-date and $510 million in the third quarter alone. Of course, payoffs are a blessing and a curse, but in the current market environment, we are pleased to see the liquidity in our portfolio. Our team has made headway resolving watch list loans and REO assets from our legacy portfolio. Currently, 154 out of our 157 positions in our book are risk rated 2 or 3, and our overall risk rating of the entire book is 2.2. We reduced our watch list loans from 7 to 3 this quarter, with only 1.3 of our book is represented by these watch list loans. Three multifamily properties were upgraded due to credit-enhancing modifications and additional borrower equity coming to the table. One hospitality asset was sold at a price above our debt basis. Our foreclosure REO position, portfolio, increased in size to 13 positions this quarter. But as Mike will detail, it is likely to decline due to recently negotiated PSAs on four properties. The balance of our foreclosure REO consists of primarily multifamily properties in strong markets. As Mike mentioned last quarter, while we would like to resolve the REO portfolio as quickly as possible, we believe there is value in holding some of these assets until we find the best possible execution. Our liquidity position is robust. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.1 billion in available liquidity, which was strengthened by our CLO issuance near the end of the third quarter. The balance is higher than the previous quarter due to the timing of repayments and additional space on our warehouse lines, and we expect to deploy much of this liquidity, including $346 million of cash, in the relatively near future. While we did not purchase stock in the third quarter, it is an important part of our capital allocation strategy. We have $31 million remaining on our buyback allocation and our Board has extended it through December 31, 2025. FBRT is well-positioned. The team is effectively addressing positions, modifying loans, selling REO assets, and enhancing our overall credit quality of our loan portfolio through new originations. Our balance sheet features a robust multifamily-focused loan portfolio that we expect to perform well especially as market conditions stabilize. With all that, let me now turn the call over to Jerry. Story Continues Jerome Baglien Great. Thanks, Rich. And thanks, everybody, for being on today, appreciate it. Moving on to our results, let's start on slide 5 if you're following along. FBRT reported GAAP earnings of $0.30 per diluted common share this quarter and distributable earnings of a negative $0.10 per diluted common share. Distributable earnings, excluding realized losses, were $0.31 per diluted common share. This excludes $36.4 million of losses realized within the quarter related to our REO Walgreens portfolio, the majority of which was previously disclosed and recognized through GAAP earnings in second quarter. Walgreens is now fully realized with all losses to date through our distributable earnings. Overall, our earnings benefited from higher conduit income and no increase to our CECL reserve in the third quarter. Net interest income was slightly lower quarter-over-quarter as our loan portfolio size decreased and REO remained relatively constant. We hope to reverse that in future quarters. While GAAP and distributable earnings did not cover our quarterly dividend, we remain confident that our dividend level accurately reflects our portfolio's long-term stabilized earnings potential, and we're comfortable with the current level. Moving to slide 7, we can cover our origination activity. We added $380 million in new loan commitments during the quarter. Consistent with our strategy, these loans were primarily multifamily across the Southeast and Southwest. During the quarter, we also received a total of $510 million in loan repayments, primarily from the multifamily sector. But as Rich mentioned, also $40 million from office loans. Moving to slide 8. Our average cost of debt on our core portfolio stayed relatively flat at SOFR plus 2.03%. Near the end of the quarter, we closed a $1 billion CRE CLO. This is the 11 CLO our real estate platform has issued. We were pleased with the CLO execution with an 86.5% advance rate and a weighted average cost of funds of SOFR plus 1.99 before discount transaction costs. Importantly, the transaction featured a 36-month reinvestment period, which is the longest reinvestment period on any of the CLOs that we've executed, allowing us to maximize the duration of this accretive liability. Additionally, we added over $100 million of ramp on the transaction to provide further borrowing capacity going into the fourth quarter. Demand from investors was strong, which led to oversubscription across all bond classes. With the addition of this CLO, 93% of our financings are nonrecourse, non-mark-to-market on our core book. We continue to have meaningful space on our warehouse lines and have ample unrestricted cash. Combined with our CLO reinvest, available liquidity at quarter end, as Rich mentioned, totalled $1.1 billion. Our net leverage position remained at 2.7 times with our recourse leverage standing at 0.1 times at the end of the quarter. With that, I'll turn it over to Mike to give you an update on our portfolio. Michael Comparato Thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'm going to start on slide 12. Our $5.2 billion core portfolio consists of 157 loans with an average size of $35 million. 99% of those loans are senior mortgages with 95% of them being floating rate. Our favourite sector remains multifamily, accounting for 74% of our portfolio collateral. During the quarter, we originated 16 loans at a weighted average spread of 421 basis points. The loans were across several different sectors. However, we found several attractive lending opportunities in construction. Our conduit platform had an excellent quarter, contributing generously to our performance. As I previously mentioned, we consider the conduit to be a valuable earnings booster in favourable market conditions. However, it also serves as a valuable hedge against core balance sheet losses during more challenging times. This quarter, the conduit played its protective role, offsetting a portion of our earnings loss due to nonperforming loans in REO. With respect to multifamily, clearly FBRT's focus, we do see supply-demand dynamics changing for the positive in the coming years at the asset level. New multifamily supply will be cratering shortly and permits for new starts are at decade lows. Declines in new supply and construction starts signal a shift in favour of landlords. As a result, we anticipate not only the burn off of recent rental concessions, but also rent increases in 2026 through 2028. Loan demand and requests were plentiful throughout the quarter. Investors had convinced themselves the Fed was going to start a new easing cycle, and the 10-year treasury was hitting lower yields not seen in some time, toward the 3.6% level. Unfortunately, after the Fed rate cut, we witnessed the 10-year widen roughly 70 basis points in a relatively short period of time. We believe this may cause a pause in transaction while investors digest the move. We continue to see the bulk of the public mortgage REITs, together with the vast majority of banks, mostly regional and community banks, remain on the sidelines. Legacy loans, specifically office, will plague these groups for a long time to come. The New York Fed in its recently released white paper on extend and pretend believes that these banks are only prolonging the inevitable and ultimately making things worse. Office continues to be very challenging. We are seeing assets trade at levels that were simply unfathomable a few years ago. We are also hearing anecdotes of lenders unwilling to take title to office assets to avoid the mark-to-market realities. CMBS office delinquency is up 100 basis points just month-over-month, hitting nearly 9.5%. We believe office delinquencies will surpass the all-time high, and perhaps meaningfully, of approximately 10.5% seen in 2012 after the GFC. Unfortunately, things could not be unhealthier in the office sector, and we believe the bottoming process will take another two to five years. We see no reason to be active in this space. On the other hand, FBRT has taken the exact opposite position of extend and pretend. We believe wholeheartedly in acknowledge and address. We've written down the assets that needed to be written down and are proactively taking title to other assets in an effort to clean up the balance sheet as quickly as possible. We believe we can resolve REO faster than our borrowers who have seen their equity vanish due to meaningful declines in valuation. Our goal is to get out of the proverbial woods as soon as possible. Addressing our issues head-on and resolving them proactively is the best way to accomplish that goal. And to that end, we made excellent progress this quarter. Slide 14 is a summary of our watch list. Our watch list is down to three positions, but given the size, the watch list is truly only two loans, both 5-rated office assets that we have written down in previous quarters. We believe we will be taking title to the Denver office asset in Q4 or Q1 of next year. Moving to slide 15, we hold 13 foreclosure REO positions at quarter end. The REO book is largely multifamily, and 4 of these properties are already under contract to be sold at or above current market values. Excluding the remaining Walgreens stores, the $18.5 million office building in Portland, and the four properties under PSA, the remaining REO portfolio consists of seven multifamily properties, four in North Carolina, two in Texas and one in Cleveland, Ohio. Our equity asset management team is fully engaged in stabilizing these assets as quickly as possible in order for us to maximize recovery on asset sales. While we are very comfortable owning real estate, and we believe there are positive tailwinds around the corner for fundamentals at the multifamily asset level, our goal is to liquidate the REO portfolio as quickly as possible and reinvest those proceeds into new origination. I cannot stress enough the exceptional progress the team has made on our watchlist and REO assets. We continue to be laser-focused on resolutions. Lastly, we were happy to see sub-4% tenure as it brought a lot of hope back in the industry and had several visible industry names officially call a bottom. We've been in the higher for longer camp for a long time, but still called the multifamily valuation bottom several quarters ago. That said, we simultaneously commented that we do not see a V-shaped recovery in multifamily values and believe we will bounce around these levels for a while. Thus far, that call has been largely on point, and at the moment, we continue to hold that view. As the 10-year blew back out to now over 4.3%, we are concerned about the headlights and the dear meeting once again. If we have truly averted recession, and we aren't saying we have, that means we should revert to a normalized positively sloping yield curve. If the Fed is targeting 3% to 3.5% Fed funds, that means a normalized yield curve is going to produce a 10-year treasury yield 100 to 150 basis points wider. We believe a significant decline in long-term interest rates, such as a return to two handle yields on the 10-year treasury, is unlikely without a significant banking crisis. For all of those hoping for meaningfully lower rates, we would just say be careful what you wish for. The FBRT team has been busy. We remain diligently focused on improving the credit quality of our portfolio, whether through new loan originations, credit-enhancing loan modifications, or actively managing our REO properties for future sale. We are fortunate to have one of the largest teams in the industry, which allows us to effectively manage all of the aforementioned tasks, and we are positioning ourselves to be a market leader exiting the woods. With that, I would like to turn it back over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Question and Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions) Matthew Erdner, JonesTrading. Matthew Erdner You touched on it briefly a little bit about the conduit business. I noticed that fixed rate loans increased to 5% from 3% quarter-over-quarter. Could you provide some additional color on what you're seeing here and kind of the expectation for the conduit business as a whole going forward? Michael Comparato Matt, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. Look, I think the conduit had an exceptional third quarter. Obviously, rates are going to throw a little bit of a wet towel on that for coming quarters. If nothing else, a little bit of time for people to just digest where rates are. The reality is, even with rates going out to current levels, CMBS still is one of the cheapest financing options in the marketplace. This move happened fast. It's a meaningful move. And I think we just need a little bit more time to digest it to really give better guidance on what it means for the conduit in the coming quarters. Matthew Erdner Got you. Yes, that's helpful there. And then talking about CMBS, kind of the available-for-sale securities, looking at those 10 bonds that you guys kind of have, do you think of that as an additional source of income and liquidity? And how are you going to manage that book going forward? Michael Comparato Yes. I mean we've opportunistically been bond buyers when we thought the returns made sense versus whole loan origination. We have not been active buyers through the last few months of kind of the very aggressive credit spread tightening that we've seen. The returns in that space are fantastic for the bonds that we own. We do view it as some sort of liquidity management. But to be honest, the returns we're making in that book, there's just no reason to sell them. We can't generate the returns in whole loan origination that we can in the existing bond portfolio. Operator Stephen Laws, Raymond James. Stephen Laws Appreciate the comments in the prepared remarks. I wanted to follow up with the -- sorry, let me start with Mike. Mike, on the seven REOs I guess that you mentioned, four NC, two Texas, one Ohio that you guys are holding assets. Can you talk a little bit about (technical difficulty) Michael Comparato Excuse me, Stephen, it's a little choppy. Stephen Laws Sorry about that. Let me see if this is better. Mike, can you talk about the sentiment in lease-up and potential timing of those monetizations? Is that a first half event, or is it something that's more backend loaded next year? Michael Comparato Stephen, thanks for the question. As I mentioned, we've got four under contract. We're going to continue to chop away at the Walgreens portfolio. All five of those are on the market for sale right now. One of them is under contract. Would really hope to be done with Walgreens in its totality by the end of Q1 next year, chance maybe a few more selling in Q4 of this year of the remaining multifamily. We'll have two that are going on the market either in December or early January that I would expect to have closed by the end of Q1. And then probably the remaining four or five that will be a little bit longer holds. But as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, it is clearly stabilize as fast as you can, move them as fast as you can. We are not looking for these to necessarily be profit centers. If profits come out of them, that's a great byproduct of REO, but we really want to get this cash back and get it redeployed. A little bit more in Q1, a little bit throughout the course of 2025, and then just wrap it up, hopefully, by the end of next year. Stephen Laws Great. Appreciate those comments. Jerry, I want to talk NII for a second. A little lower than I expected in Q3. Can you talk about the timing of repayments, which were pretty material, $500 million higher than I was looking for, versus new investments and kind of what a full quarter -- you thought full quarter impact there? And then as we look out the next quarter or two, what are the expectations around repayments? Is it going to take all the originations to keep the portfolio stable? Or do you expect some portfolio growth as we move forward? Jerome Baglien Yes. Maybe I'll just start with expectations. I mean I think we're tracking to kind of a normalized year in terms of repayments for us, which is turning roughly 1/3 of the portfolio. If you look at what we're at so far, I mean it's going to be another $300-plus million would be my guess on kind of the low end. Could be higher from there. Which Rich said is great and not great at the same time because we have to redeploy that. I think we keep our projections updated to try and replace what's paying off. That's always the goal, that we're not shrinking the portfolio, and we try and line it up as close as we can. In terms of Q3, I don't think there is a tremendous drag from some of the mismatch on when stuff came back versus when we put it on. I think more of the drag is just the turnover on the other assets, just the stuff that's less productive, the stuff that went from loan to REO. That really creates more drag than kind of the natural portfolio repayment, redeployment. Stephen Laws Great. Appreciate that color and the comments in the prepared remarks. Certainly not a bad thing that people paying off as expected on time. And then one modelling question. You said you are likely to go REO in Q4, Q1. I think there's a $27 million specific reserve there. Will that run through DE on the transfer to REO? Or will that not run through DE until that asset is sold? Jerome Baglien The answer is, it depends. If we -- our policy on DE is if we think that loss is essentially crystallized or unrecoverable at that point, we'll run it through. Probably a decent likelihood on that one. If that's the place that we end up, we'll reassess value, reassess market at that time and come to a conclusion at that point. Operator Steve Delaney, JMP Securities Steven Delaney Rich, let me start with you, if I could. Maybe sort of a big picture question on the bridge business as you see it. Obviously, you shrunk in the third quarter, and I know Stephen Laws touched on some of this, but down to the 5.2%, the Fed is probably going to cut Thursday, the outlook for Fed funds futures, maybe we probably get below 4% here some point in late 2025. I mean I would think that would be very constructive for the bridge business. And as we think about your portfolio size and your leverage at 2.7, is it conceivable -- three turns of leverage is kind of I thin, what we normally view as sort of the top, close to the top end of the range. I'd view you as being slightly under-levered. If you were to move with the benefit of the Fed cuts and if you took your leverage up to three with your current equity base, it should put your portfolio at the $6 billion mark or slightly higher. Is that a realistic outlook for 2025? And I know you're not going to force your operations to meet -- to hit a certain number. But I guess is my outlook realistic in terms of how you and the team see 2025? Sorry for the long-winded question. Richard Byrne No, it's a good question. Thanks, Steve. I would answer it this way. As you've heard us say and we've said repeatedly across as many earnings calls as we can, the current vintage of new loans that we see today are amongst the best we've seen in years. And literally, every loan we put into our book increases the quality of our book. And the stat we're showing, we're going to keep updating it, is that 40% of our book is of these new loans. Without a doubt, if we see attractive new supply, we're going to put it on, and we have lots of capacity to do so. Before we even start thinking about increasing leverage, and we've always given a target, I think, somewhere between 2.25, 2.5 and 3, and we've always operated in that range or probably in the low end of that range almost every quarter since our inception. But remember, Steve, we have $350 million of cash. We also have, as you've heard us detail, Mike's gone through, a lot of REO that we're cycling through and generating liquidity to put productive earnings power behind once we redeploy that into the current market. We have -- I think we have a long time before we need to think about whether or not we want to increase leverage. We just have a lot of added earnings power in the portfolio just without touching leverage. I think that's how we're thinking about it. As long as the market produces, which it has pretty consistently, attractive loans, we're going to put them on. And one of the reasons why these loans are so attractive is because most of the folks that we typically compete against for loans like this, whether it's banks or some of our public mortgage REIT comps or the private lenders or whoever it is, a lot of them are still on the sidelines given office exposure and other issues. And we've just had a great chance to look at pick of the litter and putting on good risk on our books. I hope that answered the question. Steven Delaney No, very helpful. Michael Comparato And Steve, this is Mike. Let me just add a little something to that because just reading between the lines of your question, the demand for loans is massive right now. There is no shortage of opportunities to write loans. I think you were getting to, if rates come down, loan demand goes up. And I just want to be clear, we have a ton of loan demand right now. There's no lack of investable or lendable opportunities. And look, the other thing that I would say is perspective matters so much, right? Yes, would a 4% Fed funds certainly be moving in the right direction? Of course. It's better than Fed funds at 5%. But if I told you three years ago that Fed funds were going to go from 0% to 4%, you would have said that's an unmitigated disaster. We still aren't out of any sort of big picture legacy loan problems with Fed funds at 4%. Yes, it's better, but it is not a panacea. Steven Delaney Got it. I appreciate that. And just a quick follow-up, Mike, for you on the conduit business. Could you quantify for us sort of the size of your locked pipeline of conduit commitments at this point? And how effective have your hedges been given the 70-basis point backup in the 10-year? Michael Comparato We have really managed that book exceptionally well. And the best way to manage the conduit business is to sell loans. The best hedge is moving the book. We actually have zero rate locked or committed loans as we sit here today. We have sold everything on balance sheet, we have nothing to move, and we're kind of reloading inventory to get ready for the next transaction. The conduit is largely sitting in as good of a spot as it could from an exposure standpoint. Operator (Operator Instructions) Tom Catherwood, BTIG. William Catherwood Mike, following up on a comment you made on Steve's question, your peers have been talking about accelerating transactions in 2025, creating more origination opportunities. Obviously, you're not waiting until 2025. What's different about FBRT's deal flow that allowed you to complete $1.6 billion of originations in 2024? And kind of how much of a pickup could we see in 2025? Michael Comparato Thanks, Tom. Yes. Look, I think first and foremost, we didn't have the legacy issues that I think a lot of the competitive space has had to deal with. We have less than 5% office. A lot of the industry is at 25% plus in office. And we made a very good macro call at kind of the peak of valuations to focus our origination three years ago on nicer, newer vintage assets in large markets, and that call has paid dividends. We just didn't have to play the amount of defence I think that most of the industry had to play around older vintage multi and certainly office. That let us play offense for most of '24. In addition to that, I think we have one of the broadest product offerings in the entire industry, certainly within the middle market. I mean we do everything from CMBS to traditional bridge, occasionally writing mezz loans. We have a construction loan business. I think we've got just a really, really interesting product offering that some people don't that keep us busier than most. And the last thing that I would say is I do think we bought a lot of street credibility over the past few years. COVID hit in March of 2020. We wrote our first post-COVID loan on April 22, 2020, and proceeded to be the only active lender in the market for the next six months. In 2023, when everyone went to the sidelines, we closed over $1 billion of loans. I think that the market has come to the realization that when it's 72 and sunny outside, everybody extends credit. And BSP, when the proverbial hits the fan, stays in business. Spreads might be wider, leverage might be lower, covenants might be tighter, but we're still extending credit in those times. And I think the markets realize that maybe we're a good group to have a relationship with going forward. Richard Byrne Tom, it's Rich. And just to add to all that is, you are right, a number of, listening to earnings calls like you do, a lot of competitors or fellow lenders are increasing or talking about increasing their origination activities or some of them even doing so now. But think about that context, $1.6 trillion of CRE loans are going to come due over the next three years. 50% of our market is bank loans. The banks are largely not participating in this renaissance of new lending. We'll see how much everybody else does. There's still, from a macro basis, a great opportunity to be a lender right now. And as Mike said, we're certainly picking up a lot of new clients from those left behind, whether it's banks or nonbank lenders. William Catherwood Appreciate those thoughts. And then kind of last one for me, maybe on dividend coverage. We understand the lag between repayments and originations and that flowing through to net interest income. But how long do you think it takes to redeploy your capital back into loans to the point where your DE is fully covering dividends? Jerome Baglien Yes, Tom. This is really an REO story. As soon as we get the REO gone and get it back into loans, we're back at coverage. This is -- we largely expected there to be a little bit of noise in the numbers as we cycled through kind of this REO and get it sold. But we're -- we could not be more confident in the earnings power of the platform once we get through this and stabilize. The answer is we want to get there as fast as we can. Obviously, the market is going to dictate that timing as much as we are. I would have told you 70 basis points ago on the 10-year that we were going to get through it a little bit faster. Things might slow a little bit here, but we'll get through it all. We will get back there. And obviously, the goal is to get back there as soon as possible. But this is entirely an REO conversation, not a lack of investable or originate able opportunities. Richard Byrne And Tom, sorry to pile on, Mike and I talk about this every day, so we're all like-minded on this. We and our Board set our dividend policy based on our earnings power look. And we like to look at that not over like a quarter at a time, but what the earnings power of the company is. And so whether that takes one quarter or takes a little longer, not really a consideration. And as far as REO as well, remember, we have $350 million of cash. We have a lot more earnings power than we're demonstrating now, and we feel confident in the level of our dividend. Operator And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Lindsey Crabbe for any closing remarks. Lindsey Crabbe We appreciate you joining us today. Please reach out if you have any further questions. We look forward to speaking with you soon. Thanks, and have a great day. Operator The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

to Underweight from Neutral on Wednesday, with a revised price target of $23, down from $50, citing increased uncertainty surrounding both the company's business fundamentals and its financial reporting practices. JPMorgan analysts noted several key concerns driving the downgrade, beginning with transparency issues. They explained: \"The company refrained from providing further transparency around the issues leading to the disagreement with the prior auditor (E&Y) even as it reaffirmed the Special Committee opinion that the Audit committee had acted independently and that there is no evidence of fraud or misconduct.\" Additionally, JPMorgan cited management's lack of commitment to leadership changes as a negative factor, especially as the company has yet to appoint a new auditor\u2014a delay that could further prolong its noncompliance with SEC filings. In terms of business fundamentals, JPMorgan believes demand for Super Micro's current generation Hopper-based servers has slowed, with customers now awaiting next-generation Blackwell-based products. They state that this lull in demand could force Super Micro to reduce prices, pressuring its margins in a highly competitive industry. JPMorgan also highlighted concerns over Super Micro's \"$5 billion of inventory on the balance sheet,\" which could amplify pricing risks as demand moderates. Furthermore, Super Micro is said to face challenges in maintaining its gross margins within its long-term target range of 14-17%, given that delays in next-generation GPU products may impact its leadership in AI server capabilities. JPMorgan also expects the company to lose market share to other server providers, especially in the enterprise segment. The investment bank has lowered its revenue growth expectations and now applies a 7x P/E multiple to its 2026 earnings forecast for Super Micro, reflecting what it sees as greater financial uncertainty ahead.
