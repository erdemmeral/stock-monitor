[{"text": "LIVE The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs You Asked: Testing TV tuners and Nano-LED explained Caleb Denison Sun, Jan 26, 2025, 9:00 PM 5 min read On today\u2019s You Asked: From mini to micro to nano \u2014 what\u2019s next, and what\u2019s with those words? Also, how do you know if a TV has a great tuner? Are more audio reviews coming? The trouble with tuners Phil Nickinson / Digital Trends Jim from \u201cthe middle of OTA nowhere\u201d (Asheville, NC), writes: First, does anyone test the tuners in TVs for the ability to pull distant stations and stability? Are there any set-top boxes that are known for having very good tuners? Second, the 2024 TCL 75-inch QM8 is going for $1,300 right now \u2014 the same as the new QM6K . Which would be a better buy for sports? I have no use for the soundbar they are throwing on the pre-orders. First off, Asheville is beautiful! Who needs OTA TV when nature\u2019s TV is right out your front door? I\u2019m kidding, of course. Does anyone test the tuners in TVs for the ability to pull distant stations and keep them stable? Not as far as I\u2019m aware. Consumer Reports used to periodically include reports on tuner testing, but I don\u2019t know if they still do. (Suggestion: Ping Jim Wilcox there, tell him that Caleb sent you, and ask him to advocate for you.) TV tuner testing is challenging because it\u2019s very specific, and the tester needs to be in just the perfect spot: a place where a signal is accessible but hard to get. Then TVs need to be ranked based on how well they pull in that signal. Without breaking into the TV tuner\u2019s specs and knowing the input sensitivity rating, I\u2019m not sure how you could determine on paper which TV might have a superior tuner for your particular case. Channel Master The better bet? Having a great TV antenna in the right place, with the ability to aim it, is way more effective than relying on a tuner to pull in a station. A tuner can be more sensitive and it could be good at locking on that signal. However, if the signal itself is dodgy it\u2019s not like an amplifier or tuner can make it better. Given this is a priority for you, I imagine you likely already have the best possible antenna or aerial. I can\u2019t help determine the best tuners because I am in a place where getting local stations is fairly easy. Harder-to-get stations are often a result of geography getting in the way. Dedicated tuner boxes may not be better than every built-in tuner, but they have one job \u2013 so hopefully they\u2019re built to be as good as possible. I have not tested them myself but I hear the Silicondust HDHomeRun tuners are good as are those made by TBS \u2014 the 5520SE specifically. As for 2024 QM8 vs. QM6K? I haven\u2019t tested the QM6K yet (it\u2019s coming). However, I\u2019d put money on the QM8 being better. If you can\u2019t wait, buy the QM8 while you still can \u2014 with TCL\u2019s current Super Bowl sale, it\u2019s probably as inexpensive right now as it ever will be. Story Continues Wanted: more audio reviews Zeke Jones / Digital Trends Chris in Vancouver, BC writes: Your channel in recent years has changed focus from AVR equipment in general to TVs and select high-end soundbars \u2014 almost exclusively it seems. The reviews for things like earbuds and headphones seemed to dwindle in 2024. More relevant to my question, reviews on home theatre audio equipment have been non-existent. Your videos do reference AVRs, and your set always shows off a revolving set of speakers (and always makes me want to learn more about them). Clearly the channel sees the importance and popularity of these items for a full theatre experience. Is there any chance we could start to see more reviews of audio equipment, consumer grade speakers, AVRs, amps, and preamps in the future? It\u2019s true that over time we have become more and more focused on TVs. The reason is rather involved, but simply put: We get way, way more views on TV content than audio content. Similarly, we get far more views on soundbars and accessible surround systems like the Bravia Theater Quad than we do on more conventional speakers, receivers, amps, digital-to-analog converters ( DACs ), etc. Lest you think we are just in it for the money \u2026 no, that isn\u2019t the case. We do have to run a profitable business and I have managed to carve out a niche in TVs and video in general, so, as you can imagine, that\u2019s become a core part of my business on YouTube. Zeke Jones / Digital Trends However, nobody would like more of the \u201cA\u201d in our A/V coverage than me. I am a musician and a low-key audiophile. I love everything about at-home music listening. Given a budget, I will spend more on my audio system than my TV if forced to choose between the two. Right now, I can make about three videos a week on average. You Asked is one of them. That leaves two videos. One is usually a TV review. Another may be a TV unboxing, or as you pointed out, audio gear that a lot of folks want to learn about or buy. Could I do more high-end audio stuff? Yes, but folks need to show up and watch it. I\u2019ve learned from experience on YouTube that you need to be consistent with topic coverage. So I would need to do it consistently and often enough to build up an audience. (I\u2019d love to do it, but I think we\u2019d need to make some operational tweaks to make it work. I\u2019ll see what I can do.) Mini, micro, nano \u2026 what\u2019s next? Samsung \u2013 114\u201d Class MICRO LED Digital Trends Yeni writes: I heard some people call QDEL \u201cnanoLED.\u201d So does that mean this is the real nanoLED? What should come after microLED TVs \u2014 a superior version of the already extremely superior microLEDs? Are we progressing that fast? I haven\u2019t even got a microLED TV yet. I want to hear your explanation since nobody on the internet does it like you. First, the pace of technology waits for no-one. Just kidding, you aren\u2019t getting left behind. Here\u2019s the thing: There\u2019s a disconnect between microLED and nanoLED. In the case of nanoLED, the \u201cnano\u201d is actually referencing a measurement of size, whereas the \u201cmicro\u201d in microLED is a loose reference to the size: about 50 to 100 micrometers. When regular LEDs became smaller, the industry used the word \u201cmini\u201d to indicate a reduction in size. However, when LEDs became even smaller, they were labelled as \u201cmicro\u201d because micro sounds smaller than mini. I\u2019m not sure it had much to do with micro \u2014 micrometer \u2014 as a measurement. With nano, quantum dots are technically nanoparticles: particles that measure at the nanoscale. Nano is 10 to the negative ninth power (10 \u2212 9 ) and are much, much smaller than microLEDs. The difference between a microLED and a single quantum dot is like comparing the size of a soccer ball to a blade of grass on the pitch. One is fairly visible with the naked eye, but seeing the other requires a microscope. To get smaller than a nanoparticle, we would have to go to the pico scale, which is 10 to the negative twelfth power (10 \u2212 12 ). I just have a hard time seeing how this is a benefit to a display. I would worry less about how big the light is and pay more attention to how it is used to your benefit. Keep those questions coming. If you have a question you want answered, please send it to You Asked at Digital Trends dot com and we\u2019ll see if your question gets picked to be answered on the show.

leveraged ETFs: A high-risk, high-reward bet on short-term market volatility Giovanny Moreano Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 5:24 PM 7 min read There are a multitude of leveraged strategies aimed at retail investors. Most of these follow the performance of major indexes, while others track niche areas of the market like the semiconductor and biotech industries. With leveraged strategies, investors hope to capture additional return using the power of debt. What is leveraged trading? Leveraged investing lets traders use debt to increase their buying power. Investors borrow money and then purchase extra shares of an investment. If the investment goes up, they\u2019ll make more than if they had purchased only what they could afford with their cash on hand. By taking additional risk , traders seek to capture outsized returns. Also known as margin trading, this strategy can be risky because those bets become outsized losses when a trade goes south. Plus, traders need to pay back the borrowed funds along with interest and any transaction fees. Apart from these factors, traders are on the hook for capital gains taxes if the assets are held in a taxable account. Leveraged ETFs: What they are and how they work Leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETFs) take this principle of leverage and use it to juice the potential returns on a broad index such as the S&P 500. Leveraged funds use what are known as financial derivatives to help boost the fund\u2019s performance. For example: If the benchmark index is up 1 percent, a basic S&P 500 index fund should also rise about 1 percent. But a leveraged ETF may try to boost that daily performance by two or even three times. When the S&P 500 is up 1 percent, a leveraged ETF tracking the index could rise 2 percent or even 3 percent. The exact performance depends on the amount of leverage used. While that might sound tempting, the potential losses can be just as pronounced. Using the hypothetical example above, when the stock market drops 2 percent, a triple-leveraged ETF could plunge around 6 percent, depending on the underlying assets. It\u2019s worth noting that leveraged ETFs aim to enhance the daily performance of certain market indexes. If the stock market goes up 10 percent this year, you may not get a 20 or 30 percent return by using these leveraged ETFs. For this reason, these funds don\u2019t make sense as long-term holdings and should only be used by short-term traders. The best leveraged ETFs With that in mind, here are some of the most popular leveraged ETFs, with data as of Jan. 27, 2025. ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ (SQQQ) This highly leveraged ETF offers three times downside exposure to large-cap, tech-heavy companies in the Nasdaq 100 index . The average daily volume for this ETF is about 43.7 million shares, making it one of the most popular leveraged funds. Story Continues Expense ratio: 0.95 percent Assets under management: $2.1 billion ProShares Ultra S&P 500 (SSO) This fund offers two times daily upside leverage exposure to the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index. The average daily volume for this ETF is about 2.1 million shares. Expense ratio: 0.89 percent Assets under management: $5.8 billion ProShares UltraPro Short Dow30 (SDOW) This ETF offers three times downside leverage exposure to the Dow Jones Industrial Average . The average daily volume for this ETF is about 3.2 million shares. Expense ratio: 0.95 percent Assets under management: $227.7 million Direxion Daily Small Cap Bull 3X Shares (TNA) This fund offers three times leveraged upside exposure to small-cap companies in the Russell 2000 index . The average daily volume for this ETF is around 13.4 million shares. Expense ratio: 1.08 percent Assets under management: $2.4 billion Direxion Daily Small Cap Bear 3X Shares (TZA) On the flip side, this fund offers three times leveraged downside exposure to small-cap companies in the Russell 2000. The average daily volume for this ETF is around 29.4 million shares. Expense ratio: 1.04 percent Assets under management: $246.9 million Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3x Shares (SOXL) This ETF provides three times leveraged upside exposure to an index of companies involved in developing and manufacturing semiconductors. The average daily volume for this ETF is about 75.7 million shares. Expense ratio: 0.76 percent Assets under management: $9.6 billion ProShares UltraPro QQQ (TQQQ) This fund amps the exposure to the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, aiming to give traders three times the daily move in that index. The average daily volume is around 44.8 million shares. Expense ratio: 0.84 percent Assets under management: $26.6 billion Direxion Daily S&P 500 Bull 3x (SPXL) This ETF aims for three times the daily return on the S&P 500, which can run higher quickly in a raging bull market. The average daily volume is 3.4 million shares. Expense ratio: 0.91 percent Assets under management: $5.3 billion How to buy leveraged ETFs Leveraged ETFs can be valuable for seasoned traders as increased volatility provides short-term opportunities to quickly turn a profit on a trade. And with leveraged ETFs that allow traders to profit when the market drops \u2014 called inverse leveraged ETFs \u2014 traders can profit even if the market falls. Consider the ProShares UltraShort QQQ ETF (QID), which seeks to return two times the opposite performance of the Nasdaq 100 index. So, if the benchmark is down 2 percent, this ETF should rise about 4 percent. During increased periods of market volatility , these types of speculative investments can be lucrative. Depending on your financial situation and risk tolerance, leveraged ETFs can form a key part of your trading strategy. Your level of financial knowledge and engagement with your investments are important factors to consider carefully, however. Investors should approach leveraged ETFs with prudence. Remember, these types of market instruments are a double-edged sword, since they magnify gains as well as losses. Once you determine your comfort level, decide what percentage of your total account to allocate into these risky assets. Even experienced traders often start small and have an exit strategy. The key is to stick to your plan and know when to close out of a losing position. What to consider when buying leveraged ETFs Usually reserved for sophisticated investors, leveraged trading has gained popularity in recent years among retail investors. Lured by the potential of fast money, many have turned to leveraged ETFs as a way to get in on the action. Leveraged ETFs are a type of investment that aims to magnify returns through financial derivatives and debt. Essentially, they are ETFs on steroids. There are plenty of screening tools to find these funds, including those provided by many brokerage firms. While factors like management fees and historical trading performance are important considerations, you should thoroughly review the fund\u2019s prospectus. A prospectus acts as a legal contract, preventing fund managers from deviating from what they said they would do. By reviewing this information before investing, you can determine whether the fund\u2019s strategy aligns with your investment goals . As you narrow your options, the key features to consider are: Leverage: This metric is qualified by a numeral followed by the letter \u201cx.\u201d So, a fund like the Direxion Daily S&P 500 Bull 3X Shares (SPXL) offers three times the performance of the S&P 500 index. The leveraged expected return is for a single day, not cumulative over time. Expense ratios and fees: By default, most ETF providers charge competitive fees. But even at relatively low levels, those costs can add up, so make sure to compare and read the fine print. Trading volume: The more liquid a fund is, the easier it will be to buy and sell. Look at how average trading volume compares to similar ETFs. Fund performance: While doing your research, take a look at a fund\u2019s longer-term performance. But remember, these funds are not intended as a buy-and-hold strategy. Assets under management (AUM): Many investors use this figure as a vote of confidence to assess other investors\u2019 engagement with a particular ETF. Along with AUM figures, it might be helpful to check the longevity of the fund. Fund issuer: Brands are powerful. And that\u2019s no different in the ETF space. Some investors feel comfortable investing only with large asset managers, while others see the value in newcomers. Decide what works for you and your financial needs. Use these criteria as a starting point to do more research. Some investors find it helpful to study the daily performance of leveraged ETFs before committing any money. \u2014 Bankrate\u2019s Brian Baker contributed to an update of this article.

Trump's tariffs EXCLUSIVE: Spanish Men\u2019s Label Unfeigned Debuts First International Flagship in Paris\u2019 Marais Rhonda Richford Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 9:00 AM 6 min read PARIS \u2014 Men\u2019s label Unfeigned has opened its first international door in Paris\u2019 Marais, as the young Spanish brand expands its retail footprint outside of Madrid. The young brand, founded by Rafa Gomez in 2019, has fast seen retail success and has big growth ambitions. It\u2019s carried by 52 retailers worldwide, with the U.K., U.S., and Japan its strongest markets. More from WWD Salone del Mobile.Milano Planning Saudi Edition as Italian Design Firms Expand Retail Footprint Keeping It Real: Retail Buyers Love the Elevated Everyday for Fall Anya Taylor-Joy Talks 'The Gorge,' Jisoo, Jenna Ortega and Venus Williams Buckle Up at Dior The interior of the Paris store takes its design cues from the Madrid location, while adding new textures to give the Marais space its own identity and giving traditional materials a modern makeover. \u201cIt\u2019s a new take on classics, so it\u2019s pretty much what we are trying to do with the clothing design,\u201d said Gomez. The new 750-square-foot space extends the brand\u2019s Spanish-style-meets-Scandi-minimalism to retail, combining raw materials with industrial and contemporary textures, including painted clay bricks, stainless steel racks and mirrored walls. It relies on clean lines, neutral colors and bright natural light to create a store that is connected to the Madrid aesthetics, but with its own Parisian flair. One unique touch is a popcorn-sprayed wall coating reminiscent of 1970s-style ceilings, but in this more environmentally friendly incarnation the texture is made from sprayed cotton. Interiors for the space at 22 rue de la Perle were overseen by French rising star architect Ana\u00efs Fernon, who blended these elements for the new store. She added touches like clothing racks in the dressing rooms that surround small stools for added seating. Inside the Unfeigned store. Gomez picked the prime Marais location for its similar feel to the trendy Salesas district. \u201cThe location we have in Madrid is also kind of like the vibe in the Marais, it\u2019s a very small [store] but the area is full of arty, multibrand boutiques and beauty stores,\u201d he said. Former tech executive Gomez launched the brand just five years ago with sustainability \u2014 and dependability \u2014 in mind. That resulted in an approach that builds on what it call its \u201cnever out of stock\u201d staples, key pieces available year-round so that the Unfeigned clients can always find their favorite basic. Seventy percent of the collection falls in this category, while the remaining 30 percent changes seasonally. \u201cWe are building a really strong base in permanent garments, so our customer can find them in every collection,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cThen we are playing around with the remaining 30 percent \u2014 seasonal colors, new design, and more.\u201d Story Continues The \u201cmore\u201d includes special capsules and collaborations to come. Gomez was spurred by his quest to create the perfect T-shirt, and the brand\u2019s ultra-heavyweight version that still proves to be its most popular item. Tech-infused pieces are also top sellers. The brand\u2019s sleek but relaxed technical garments are a hit with its key demographic, which Gomez pinpoints as tech executives or bankers between 40 and 55 years old who are willing to spend on high quality pieces that will last. It\u2019s also \u201ca very good moment\u201d for a brand like Unfeigned as the luxury market roils. The brand is elevating staple pieces, creating sleek silhouettes on puffer jackets for example, or taking menswear classics and updating them with streetwear cues. Unstructured blazers in water-repellent recycled nylon, or drawstring trousers on a suit is one such look. With its Spain-meets-Scandi aesthetic, the pieces combine classic fabrics, such as water-repellent wool, with performance features, such as technical linings. \u201cFashion in general, in our niche segment, is going in that direction because stock is a problem,\u201d said Gomez. \u201cSince COVID, stocks have been like a punishment from several brands. We think having this kind of collection is going to help us to grow\u2026we can see that the product is working.\u201d Gomez cites ease for the professional customer who knows he can rely on the brand for new takes on classic pieces he loves season after season. \u201cHe\u2019s not looking for the trend or for \u2018fashion.\u2019 He\u2019s looking for a product that works in the world and that he\u2019s comfortable with.\u201d A view inside the Unfeigned store. In the Madrid store, the brand has wide appeal to locals and tourists alike, said Gomez. With a busy location in the trendy Salesas district, Unfeigned has honed its retail strategy. \u201cOur clientele is very international, so we got a lot of feedback from other countries, which is awesome considering that we\u2019re gonna go to the most touristic destination in the world,\u201d said Gomez. He cites a wide range of consumers that seek out the brand, including clients from across Asia, as well as Mexico. The space also functions like a concept store, welcoming brands the Unfeigned team believes are attractive to their client and complementary to their brand. Those brands include footwear from Merrell, New Balance and Saucony, packs from Caribou Gear and bags from Sandqvist. Having a full range of products from other labels \u201coffers a complete, total look,\u201d plus the brands share similar values. Paris had long been a goal as the second location in part due to the city\u2019s stake as the fashion capital, but also due to family ties. \u201cWe have been in touch with the country for a long time, and in terms of fashion, Paris is the place to be,\u201d he said. \u201cFor our target market and [proximity to] trade shows and wholesale, it\u2019s a very good place for the brand.\u201d Case in point, it presented at the Welcome Edition trade show that ran during Paris Men\u2019s Fashion Week. Following Paris, Unfeigned has its sights set on London. \u201cIt is on our roadmap,\u201d said Gomez. The brand is scouting for space, with an eye on 2026. \u201cWe are now looking for spots and locations there with several agents. We are ready to go there.\u201d Gomez said that sales have grown at a steady clip over the last five years. \u201cWe are a really young brand, and every year has seen an increase for us. We are in that time now of growth,\u201d he said. B-Corp certified Unfeigned produces 80 percent of its collections in Portugal, with the remaining 20 percent, mostly shirts, produced in Spain. All fabrics are sourced from those two countries, as well as Italy. There they are working with textile manufacturer Olmetex for its high-performance technical fabrics. The boutique officially opened Thursday night during men\u2019s fashion week, bringing together clients, fashion week attendees and buyers from the Welcome Edition trade show. It was a raucous affair complete with Mescal-based cocktails.
