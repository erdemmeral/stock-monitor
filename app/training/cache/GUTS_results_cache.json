[{"text": "Stock Bulls Get AI Wake-Up Call in Bruising Plunge: Markets Wrap Rita Nazareth Tue, Jan 28, 2025, 1:04 AM 10 min read (Bloomberg) -- Wall Street had a rough start to the week on concern that a cheap artificial intelligence-model from Chinese startup DeepSeek could make valuations of the technology that has powered the bull market tough to justify.

Vienna Embraces Heat Pumps to Ditch Russian Gas Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires From New York to London and Tokyo, equities sank. While the slide in the US came after a surge to all-time highs, Monday\u2019s selloff was triggered by a rise of DeepSeek\u2019s latest AI model to the top of the Apple\u2019s appstore. The S&P 500 dropped 1.5% and the Nasdaq 100 sank 3%. A closely watched gauge of chipmakers slid the most since March 2020. Nvidia Corp.\u2019s 17% plunge erased $589 billion from its value \u2014 the largest in market history. Subscribe to the Bloomberg Daybreak podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen. In a rush for safety, defensive industries like consumer staples and health care were bid. Treasuries rallied, driving yields to the lowest levels this year. Haven currencies including the yen and the Swiss franc climbed. Energy firms expected to profit from unprecedented AI demand sank, led by a 21% beatdown for Constellation Energy Corp. The crypto world got hit. \u201cWhat was shaping up to be a big week in the markets got even bigger with the disruption in the AI space,\u201d said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. \u201cThat could make this week\u2019s megacap tech earnings even more critical to market sentiment.\u201d Monday\u2019s plunge drove new fissures into a market narrative that prevailed since the re-election of Donald Trump in November, the America-first, tech-fueled uber bullishness that saw a clear upward path for risky assets spurred by deregulation, tax cuts and even government sponsorship of AI investment. Treasury yields slid sharply as haven-seeking investors laid aside concern - for today, anyway - that the new president\u2019s policies will stoke inflation. The severity of the selloff in US assets was proportionate to the weightings of AI-enabled firms in the biggest stock indexes. Even after a recent paring to curb their influence the cohort of Nvidia, Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. account for about 40% of the Nasdaq 100. It\u2019s roughly 30% in the S&P 500, leaving both gauges significantly exposed to concerted drops in those names. Story Continues \u201cThe sudden, adverse market reaction to DeepSeek indicates that some of the key assumptions that have been driving the AI trade, and hence major indices, are getting reassessed today,\u201d said Steve Sosnick at Interactive Brokers. \u201cPart of the today\u2019s sudden adverse market reaction was a direct result of a \u2018wave of complacency\u2019 that overtook the equity market.\u201d A gauge of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d megacaps slid 2.7%. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index fell 9.15%. The Russell 2000 slipped 1%. Wall Street\u2019s favorite volatility gauge \u2014 the VIX \u2014 soared the most since about mid-December. The Dow Jones Industrial Average of blue chips rose 0.7%. The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined nine basis points to 4.53%. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.1%. Bitcoin slid 2.9% to $101,481.84. To Seema Shah at Principal Asset Management, valuations remain extended, and while vulnerabilities were expected this year, developments like DeepSeek highlight the need for diversification beyond the Magnificent Seven. \u201cI\u2019m hoping this moment encourages everyone to look beyond tech stocks,\u201d said Callie Cox at Ritholtz Wealth Management. \u201cNot because the AI story is doomed, but because there are so many opportunities in unloved sectors that have been ignored for so long. The guts of the market\u2019s foundation are still good, so it\u2019s likely that the dip will be bought here.\u201d At G Squared Private Wealth, Victoria Greene says that she\u2019s \u201cnot convinced the bubble has burst,\u201d but would be \u201csilly\u201d not to evaluate the potential risks. \u201cWe are looking carefully at how the market progresses from here and if action needs to be taken to protect and shift portfolio allocations,\u201d she noted. \u201cWe are not panickers, so tend to be buyers of big dislocations that are happening in tech, energy, and infrastructure today.\u201d Jim Thorne at Wellington-Altus Private Wealth says this is a natural evolutionary process to \u201cwork off the overbought.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s always going to be something that is going to pull back the market to the moving average,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the 1990s the \u2018it\u2019 trade was Cisco. Every six months, there would\u2019ve been something that would\u2019ve corrected for it come back down.\u201d Paul Marino at Themes ETFs, says he likes the fact that people are skeptical. \u201cAnything that goes straight up to the sky parabolic, that\u2019s when I get worried as a long-term investor,\u201d he said. The next leg lower for the biggest US tech stocks may come from the retail crowd, according to Tony Pasquariello at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. \u201cTactically speaking, I suspect the next few days bring a hurried reduction of length by the retail community,\u201d Pasquariello wrote in a note to clients Monday, adding that hedge funds have been aggressively reducing exposure for months, so this is really about the response of households. However, he\u2019s a true believer in the structural supremacy of US tech companies, which \u201carguably have only more incentive to spend.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether this is the \u2018Sputnik Moment\u2019 for stocks, but this is certainly a wake-up call that we are not the only game in town,\u201d said Paul Nolte at Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management. \u201cTo put these very high valuations in the stocks thinking they have cornered the market is a huge mistake and that is being re-rated.\u201d To Matt Maley at Miller Tabak + Co., the idea that DeepSeek\u2019s latest AI model is much more cost effective, and runs on much less-advanced chips, is raising some serious questions about what kind of earnings can be drawn from the AI phenomenon. \u201cIf these companies look like they\u2019re going to have a tough time maintaining their earnings growth (chip stocks) or a tough time reaching their earnings growth goals (the \u201cpicks and shovels\u201d companies), it\u2019s going to create some serious headwinds for today\u2019s expensive stock market, he noted. In fact, the slide in tech came at a time when the Nasdaq 100 is trading significantly above its 10-year average. All focus will be on earnings announcements from the likes of Microsoft and Apple this week to restore confidence in the so-called Magnificent Seven group of companies. Investors are heading into yet another pivotal Big Tech earnings cycle with the companies\u2019 shares near record highs and valuations stretched. A key distinction this time: The group\u2019s profit growth is projected to come in at the slowest pace in almost two years. \u201cThis should be a fairly good earnings season, but the bar has been raised and they may not be able to live up to high expectations,\u201d said Dan Taylor, chief investment officer at Man Numeric. \u201cIt will be very difficult for the group to perform the way it did last year, especially as valuations have increased.\u201d \u201cWe think big tech can keep delivering on earnings, but misses could revive concerns that big capital spending on AI won\u2019t pay off \u2013 one of three triggers to dial down our pro-risk view,\u201d BlackRock Investment Institute strategists including Jean Boivin and Wei Li. Metrics like capex-to-sales ratios and free cash flows suggest that, for now, megacap tech firms are not overextended, they said. Overinvestment should be assessed in aggregate, in our view, given AI\u2019s potential to unlock new revenue streams across the economy, they concluded. So what exactly is DeepSeek? DeepSeek was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, the chief of AI-driven quant hedge fund High-Flyer. The company develops AI models that are open-source, meaning the developer community at large can inspect and improve the software. Its mobile app surged to the top of the iPhone download charts in the US after its release in early January. The app distinguishes itself from other chatbots like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT by articulating its reasoning before delivering a response to a prompt. The company claims its R1 release offers performance on par with OpenAI\u2019s latest and has granted license for individuals interested in developing chatbots using the technology to build on it. \u201cA key theme in our outlook has been to stick with the primary uptrend \u2014 but expect disruptions along the way,\u201d said Keith Lerner at Truist Advisory Services. \u201cThe disruption caused by DeepSeek was from a less obvious corner of the market. It\u2019s doubtful that a Chinese startup will dominate globally given the current geopolitical tensions between China and the US.\u201d Corporate Highlights: UBS Group AG has begun a wave of job cuts in its home market Switzerland, with hundreds of employees receiving notice in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the matter. Est\u00e9e Lauder Cos is reviewing its portfolio of beauty brands, people with knowledge of the matter said, as the cosmetics company transitions to new leadership and looks to boost its share price. AT&T Inc. posted fourth-quarter results that beat Wall Street projections, including better-than-expected increases in mobile-phone customers and fiber-based internet subscribers, driven by seasonal promotions and bundled product offerings. Activist investor Ancora Holdings Group has nominated nine candidates for United States Steel Corp.\u2019s board and is pushing for the company to abandon a takeover by Nippon Steel Corp. SoFi Technologies Inc., a fintech lender, published a forecast for profit that missed analysts\u2019 estimates. MicroStrategy Inc. bought Bitcoin for a 12th consecutive week and unveiled details for the sale of perpetual preferred stock to help finance additional purchases of the cryptocurrency.

months, we\u2019ll all be given the gift of a new Doom game. In May, id Software will launch Doom: The Dark Ages on consoles and PC. Ahead of that release, the studio has revealed a lot about the upcoming prequel via trailers, gameplay clips, and interviews. We\u2019ve dug through the most recent revelations to pluck out, like gibs from a mutant corpse, the details we\u2019re most excited about Here are 15 pieces of information about Doom: The Dark Ages that you might want to know before it launches in Spring. Doom Slayer captured Screenshot: id Software / Kotaku As explained by id Software during the recent Xbox Developer Direct , the Doom Slayer starts the game captured and is under someone else\u2019s control. I doubt this will last long. It\u2019d be a garbage game if you weren\u2019t in control of him. It\u2019d be like playing a Call of Duty single-player campaign. New characters Screenshot: id Software / Kotaku id Software also confirmed that new characters will be introduced in Dark Ages and its cutscenes. I expect the Doom Slayer will end up killing half of the new characters we\u2019ll meet, because he has quite a temper. Features moments from Doom 2016's lore Screenshot: id Software / Kotaku If you remember in Doom 2016, you could find pieces of lore detailing big events and legendary moments from the Doom Slayer\u2019s past. In Dark Ages, we\u2019ll get to see those allusions play out as they happened! It\u2019s like they planned it. Still a violent, gory action game! Screenshot: id Software / Kotaku Don\u2019t worry, this ain\u2019t suddenly a story-focused narrative-driven game. It\u2019s still Doom and that means blood, guts, demons, and lots of guns. Gibbage! GIBBAGE! Glory kills are now player controlled Screenshot: id Software / Kotaku A big change this time around is the ability to trigger \u201cGlory Kills\u201d without having to watched a pre-canned animation. This will help in some of the bigger group fights in Dark Ages,as you\u2019ll be able to flow through dozens of enemies without stopping. Mass hordes of enemies everywhere Screenshot: id Software / Kotaku Speaking of big hordes of enemies, expect more enemies on screen than ever seen before in a modern Doom game. It ain\u2019t nuts.wad yet, but getting closer. Old school strafe aiming is back Screenshot: id Software / Kotaku Thanks to big open levels and slow moving enemy projectiles, you\u2019ll be strafing and shooting a lot more in Dark Ages, similar to old school Doom and how you often moved left or right to change your aim. Although it still has a jump. I bet you forgot OG Doom didn\u2019t have a jump. Giant mechs! Screenshot: id Software / Kotaku After two games of teasing them, id Software is finally letting you control a giant demon-killing mech. And it looks like this thing will have its own abilities, weapons, and levels. All games are 27 percent improved by the inclusion of mechs. Story Continues And also a dragon mount! Screenshot: id Software / Kotaku And to make up for making us wait nearly 10 years to use giant mechs, id also tossed in cyborg dragons you can fly. These are also fully-featured and will be used in multiple levels, also proving useful for exploration. There are many locations to explore Screenshot: id Software / Kotaku Speaking of exploration, that\u2019s a big part of Doom The Dark Ages. But you\u2019ll need places to explore, because otherwise it would be a game about standing still. id Software has thought of that, and is promising a lot of levels and variety in this next installment. Biggest maps in Doom history Screenshot: id Software / Kotaku And some of these maps will be the biggest areas ever seen in a Doom game, featuring large battlegrounds filled with hundreds of enemies to kill. To think, Doom Guy was once confined to his humble corridors. Explore to collect upgrades Screenshot: id Software / Kotaku Between large battles, you can also find secrets and upgrades that let you improve the Doom Slayer. That\u2019s going to involve exploration, and exploration more involved than pressing E against every wall tile. Simplified skill tree and progression Screenshot: id Software / Kotaku Thankfully, id Software has simplified the upgrade and progression system in Dark Ages so its not as complicated as it was in Eternal. New demons to rip apart Screenshot: id Software / Kotaku Oh and yes, there will be new enemies to kill. Imagine if there weren\u2019t. But then, after that, start trying to explain to yourself why those enemies aren\u2019t in 2016's Doom. Maybe you kill them all? Difficluty sliders Screenshot: id Software / Kotaku If you\u2019ve wanted to play Doom but find the games too fast, id Software has good news for you. In Dark Ages you\u2019ll be able to tweak the game\u2019s difficulty using various sliders to make it your perfect demon-killing experience. No multiplayer in this biggest Doom ever made Screenshot: id Software / Kotaku id Software has confirmed that Dark Ages has no multiplayer modes and instead is a massive single-player online shooter. The studio says its the biggest game they have ever made. You can read more about that here . I\u2019m very excited to jump into this massive prequel and kill thousands of demons. Doom: The Dark Ages launches on May 15 for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. For the latest news, Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .

But what happened to the 'Resistance'? Frankie TAGGART Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 4:45 AM 4 min read A pedestrian stands next to a graffiti created by French artist Big Ben street Art, depicting US Donald Trump as Darth Vader in Lyon, on November 6, 2024 (JEFF PACHOUD) When Donald Trump was inaugurated in 2017, opponents marched in pink knitted \"pussy hats\" while protesters abroad plastered streets with images of the new US president as \"Star Wars\" villain Darth Vader. Spool forward eight years -- after his entanglements with the law, two impeachments and divisive pardons of violent criminals -- and the vibe among the anti-Trump resistance movement isn't so much \"A New Hope\" as its darker sequel, \"The Empire Strikes Back.\" Although there has been sporadic protest, the United States has seen almost none of the mass mobilization that made opposition to Trump in 2017 the\u00a0largest social movement\u00a0in a half-century. Even in Congress, Democrats have been more inclined in recent weeks to talk about \"working with\" Trump -- noting his popular vote victory -- rather than going after the Republican at every opportunity. \"Resistance alone is a failed strategy. If it worked, Trump wouldn't be president,\" said political consultant Andrew Koneschusky, a former press secretary to Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. \"Democrats ran a campaign of resistance last cycle and it barely made a dent.\" Trump, 78, sparked outrage after winning a tight 2016 election despite disparaging Mexicans, boasting about groping women on the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape and facing numerous sexual misconduct allegations. Democrats see as much to worry about this time around, and yet analysts have noted a palpable lack of the anger that came with his first term. - 'The new Resistance' - There has been some limited action by Democratic leaders in California to counter Trumpism, mainly behind-the-scenes strategy sessions, and \"The People's March\" in Washington last weekend was reasonably well attended. But it was tiny compared to the 500,000-strong 2017 \"Women's March.\" Even liberal Hollywood seems cowed, with the political spotlight moving away from the music and movie stars who backed Kamala Harris in 2024 to the Tinseltown legends like Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson who have joined Trump's team. Koneschusky suggested that opposition was shifting to a more focused approach that targets specific aspects of Trump's populist \"Make America Great Again\" (MAGA) agenda, in the courts as much as in news studios. \"The Resistance hasn't vanished -- it has evolved. It has moved from the streets to the courts. Well-crafted legal challenges have replaced protests and public displays of opposition,\" he told AFP. Story Continues He pointed to more than 20 Democratic states suing to block Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship and civil society groups like the ACLU girding for a variety of legal fights. \"The lawsuit, rather than the protest, is the new Resistance,\" he said. Veteran political strategist Mike Fahey added that those who organized against Trump in 2024, only to see him win anyway, have hit a wall, and that exhaustion rather than apathy is paralyzing opposition. But he agreed that much of the opposition was simply less performative than in the past -- and not necessarily less effective. - 'The guts to fight' - \"Instead of relying on the sorts of large, dramatic demonstrations that characterized the early weeks of Trump's presidency, these organizations have begun to stage far more sophisticated and less visible public events to work their will,\" he said. While Trump's victory last November\u00a0was painful for Democrats, many believe that presenting Trump as an avatar of all society's ills -- or shrieking that every tweet was a threat to democracy -- was counter-productive. Peter Loge, the director of George Washington University's School of Media and Public Affairs, said smart opponents were tuning out the noise coming from Trump's Truth Social feed to focus instead on specific policy impacts. \"One way to think about it is like an amusement park or nightclub. When the lights are flashing and the noise is blaring it's easy to get caught in the show,\" he told AFP. \"Smoke machines, disco balls and laugh tracks drive attention and resources, but ultimately it is about how people live their daily lives -- and that's policy.\" Some groups that opposed Trump first time around reject the idea that his narrow popular vote victory gave him a broad mandate, pointing out that more people voted against him than for him in November. \"Democrats can't afford to cower behind half measures or excuses,\" said Ezra Levin, the co-executive director of progressive lobby group Indivisible. \"If they don't have the guts to fight this now, when it's all on the line, they'll be handing Trump and MAGA Republicans exactly what they want: a propaganda victory that will embolden their assault on our freedoms.\" ft/bgs View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard Recommended Stories", "symbol": "GUTS", "date": "2025-01-24T01:45:19+00:00", "sentiment":

Japanese buddy with the Midas Touch Simon STURDEE Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 12:51 PM 3 min read Trump's \"friend Masa\" was born in Japan in 1957 to ethnic Korean parents who scratched a living rearing chickens and hogs (Jim WATSON) Masayoshi Son, the Japanese tycoon helming US President Donald Trump's big new AI push, is the son of an immigrant pig farmer with a spectacular but also sketchy investment record. Trump's \"friend Masa\" was born in Japan in 1957 to ethnic Korean parents who scratched a living rearing chickens and hogs while battling discrimination. \"We collected leftover food from neighbours and fed it to cattle. It was slimy. We worked hard,\" he said later. \"And I've worked hard.\" He went to the United States aged 16 and, while studying at Berkeley, developed a translation machine that he sold for around $1 million. In his 20s, Son founded investment group SoftBank and made colossally successful early bets on Yahoo! and Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba in the 1990s. The former reportedly made him -- for a few days -- the world's richest person and the latter seemed to cement his Midas Touch reputation. \"I could smell him. We are the same animal,\" Son said of Alibaba's founder Jack Ma. Ma replied: \"He probably has the biggest guts in the world on doing investments.\" - Failures - At his eagerly awaited news conferences, Son would show slides showing geese laying golden eggs and set out glorious visions for the future. He launched his tech-focussed $100-billion Vision Fund investment vehicle in 2017, securing huge funding from Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and others. But Yahoo! and Alibaba proved to be the exceptions, not the rules, and many other Silicon Valley investments have failed, some spectacularly. This included office-sharing firm WeWork, which went bankrupt, and the hospitality chain Oyo Rooms, and Son shied away from the limelight. In the 2022-23 financial year, SoftBank's two Vision Funds posted a whopping 4.3 trillion yen ($32 billion at the time) in losses. - AI pivot - But the irrepressible Son, 67, decided to pivot to artificial intelligence (AI). Key to the coming revolution, Son hopes, will be majority Softbank-owned Arm, the British chip designer whose technology is in 99 percent of smartphones. Son wants Arm to compete with the likes Nvidia -- the two are currently partners -- and make chips for AI processes. Son promised SoftBank would invest $50 billion in the United States and create 50,000 jobs within Trump's first term. Appearing alongside the US president-elect in December, Son said he would now \"double down\" with $100 billion and generate employment for 100,000 Americans. On Tuesday Son appeared at the White House along with Trump with OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman and Oracle founder Larry Ellison to announce Stargate. Story Continues The aim is to build infrastructure to develop AI with an initial $100 billion and reaching $500 billion during Trump's second term, Son said. Son will be chairman, SoftBank will be responsible for financing and OpenAI for operations. Arm, Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle and OpenAI will provide the technology. \"This is the beginning of a golden age for America,\" Son said, predicting artificial general intelligence (AGI), a benchmark of human-level intelligence, \"very very soon.\" \"After that artificial super intelligence will come to solve the issues that mankind never ever would have thought could be solved,\" he said. - 'Mojo back'- SoftBank shares soared on the announcement, adding 10.6 percent on Wednesday in Tokyo. \"Masa has his mojo back,\" said Kirk Boodry, a SoftBank analyst at Astris Advisory. \"Inevitably, there are going to be questions about how Softbank funds this but we expect they will be able to pull in limited partners (likely Middle Eastern money as they did with Vision Fund) whilst asset sales are very likely on the agenda,\" Boodry said in a note. Amir Anvarzadeh from Asymmetric Advisors was less sure, saying that Son and Trump \"both like numbers\". \"Unless Softbank sells its stake in Arm, which is massively overvalued anyway, where is all the money going to come from?\" stu/dhw View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard Recommended Stories", "symbol": "GUTS", "date": "2025-01-22T09:51:26+00:00", "sentiment": {"score":

Although both for-profit and nonprofit providers reported improved operating margins last year compared to 2023, experts say systems will be prone to backsliding this year if they do not carefully contain costs and explore strategic growth opportunities. Health systems will seek to expand gains from 2024, including improved utilization metrics, and apply lessons learned from major supply chain crises. New challenges are on the horizon too, as a new administration comes to Washington with its own healthcare policies. \u201cHealthcare is still a very fragile sector. It operates on extremely thin margins, and this year is a year that we will have an administration change in Washington \u2014 that interjects some level of uncertainty in the whole healthcare mix,\u201d said Kevin Holloran, senior director and sector leader of the not-for-profit healthcare group at Fitch Ratings. \u201cUncertainty in general \u2026 is likely not a good thing.\u201d This year,\u00a0experts say successful health systems can get ahead of cost pressures by seeking out novel partnerships that allow them to do more while spending less, including more joint ventures, direct deals with manufacturers and spin-off ventures like Kaiser Permanante\u2019s Risant Health. Here are the top predictions for healthcare providers in 2025. Providers eye reductions to pharmacy, labor costs Although operating margins improved across the board in 2024, not all health systems recovered equally, and experts stress that providers will need to keep an eye on costs in 2025. In response to cost pressures, 53% of healthcare executives recently surveyed by Deloitte said improving efficiencies and enhancing productivity was a top priority for this year. Managing rising pharmaceutical costs, particularly those related to specialty drugs, is an immediate priority, healthcare executives say. Although the drugs are utilized by a small number of patients, they now account for 54% of health systems\u2019 total drug spend , according to consultancy Vizient\u2019s 2025 outlook. Spending is expected to further climb as drug development continues. Increased demand for diabetes medications approved for weight loss, called GLP-1s, has driven a large portion of specialty pharmaceutical spending, according to Steven Lucio, senior principal of pharmacy solutions at Vizient . Story Continues Demand for GLP-1s could rise further this year if the incoming Trump administration approves a Biden-era rule that allows Medicare to foot the bill for GLP-1s when prescribed for weight loss. Providers are investigating a number of approaches to lower their specialty pharmacy spend. Because of the drugs\u2019 high price tags,\u00a0\u201cyou want to be very judicious at how you use them,\u201d Lucio said. However, because the drugs are often developed to serve specific use cases,\u00a0health systems can have limited data to guide decisions about how to prescribe the drugs effectively, Lucio said. In response, some health systems are forming high cost drug committees to better understand the medications and to oversee prescribing practices.\u00a0Physicians and pharmacists on the committees review operational, clinical and economic data to evaluate the efficacy of prescribing the drugs. Academic health systems, like Cleveland Clinic and Vanderbilt University Medical Center ,\u00a0were early adopters of the strategy. More health systems are predicted to start up their own committees as managing pharmacy costs grows in importance this year, Vizient predicts. Other providers are teaming up with nontraditional partners like Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drugs or Civica Rx, a nonprofit generic pharmaceutical company, to directly purchase generic medications at lower costs. Community Health Systems is one of the most vocal advocates for working directly with manufacturers. All 71 of its hospitals began working with the Cost Plus Drugs Marketplace in June. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing more and more disruption of [the pharmaceutical] industry,\u201d said Fitch\u2019s Holloran. Providers are asking themselves, \u201cIsn\u2019t there a better way, cheaper way, to produce some of these drugs?\u201d Health systems will also continue to prioritize cutting labor costs next year. Although health systems spent less on labor in 2024 relative to highs recorded during the pandemic,\u00a0healthcare wages remain elevated above pre-pandemic levels, according to Mark Pascaris, senior director at Fitch Ratings. Some systems will leverage automation, such as virtual nursing, in order to be \u201cmore creative about who exactly is at the bedside,\u201d said Pascaris. \u201cHealth systems are trying to use more entry level people at a lower cost point for certain functions.\u201d Other health systems are exploring offshoring or outsourcing non-core functions, including their information technology, human resource and finance teams, said Alicia Janisch, vice chair and U.S. healthcare sector leader at Deloitte. Allina Health, Providence and AdventHealth said they have outsourced departments in pursuit of enhanced expertise and savings. Allina Health, for example, tasked Optum last February with running its IT department. Allina\u2019s Chief Operations Officer Dominica Tallarico said the partnership with Optum allows the health system to focus on its strengths. The deal also enables Allina to build out its technology suite beyond functions that staff can develop alone, she said. \u201cInnovation and technology is rapidly changing ...\u00a0the whole point is how do we really advance and not only keep pace, but how do we leapfrog in technology and in AI?\u201d\u00a0Tallarico said. Outsourcing revenue cycle management functions is another area to watch, according to Janisch. Health systems expressed growing frustrations with payers\u2019 use of algorithms to deny claims last year. While some may build their own tools to submit prior authorization documents, others will outsource to AI-powered companies, she said. Supply chain concerns will be front and center Last year\u2019s temporary closure of a major IV fluid manufacturing facility in North Carolina following Hurricane Helene served as a wake-up call to healthcare providers about the importance of diversifying the supply chain and contingency management planning. The storm took the Baxter facility offline for several days and disrupted the supply of IV fluids for 60% of hospitals nationwide , according to a letter penned by the American Hospital Association. \u201cMost health systems that I talked to were kind of caught unprepared, like the pandemic,\u201d said Eric O\u2019Daffer, research vice president of healthcare supply chain at Gartner. \u201cIt was a reactive response \u2026 almost all of them had to go into a kind of pandemic, command center modality again.\u201d The most effective health systems, including HCA Healthcare, were able to shift resources around in the wake of the natural disaster to support harder hit regions, O\u2019Daffer said. For example, HCA sent staff and supplies from its Tennessee facilities to its hospitals in Western North Carolina. However, other systems did not have a centralized list of what resources they had or where they were stored, limiting their ability to respond efficiently to the crisis, the consultant said. Moving into 2025, supply chain management will take on heightened importance as providers look for real-time visibility into where their products sit and how goods can be mobilized \u2014 especially as systems grow. \u201cHealth systems are merging and getting bigger, and the number of $20 billion-plus health systems that are multi-state, non-continuous is growing,\u201d O\u2019Daffer said. \u201cThat provides both complexity as well as potential opportunity.\u201d Some health systems have begun this work already, prompted by supply chain disruptions during the pandemic. AdventHealth, for example, created a central warehouse in 2023 in the middle of Florida to expand its supply chain resiliency. \u201cThe pandemic taught me that you want to be as nimble as possible when you\u2019re caring for others. You want to have your own supply, and you want to diversify where you get your supply well enough to where you\u2019ve got some flexibility when you need it,\u201d said Terry Shaw, CEO of Florida-based AdventHealth. Health systems will take a sharper look at AI investments Last year, excitement about AI dominated the healthcare industry, with companies teaming up with technologists to roll out numerous pilots. In 2025, experts say that providers will begin to ask: Does this actually work? AI offerings for healthcare exploded last year . Amid the hype, health systems have piloted a range of clinical and administrative tools. However, not all pilot programs have been strategic, said Elizabeth Southerlan, partner at West Monroe. Some health systems applied the latest AI without pausing to ask if it fit their organization\u2019s needs and without utilizing human-centered design when creating their pilot, Southerlan said. For example, she described one healthcare organization that piloted a scheduling tool without seeking the input of employees who do scheduling. Other organizations have rushed to implement solutions without assessing whether there is a broad need for the tool, she said. \u201cI think another area of pushback is you\u2019re solving a problem that takes up 5% of my day. Why are we investing here when there are things that are taking up 20% of my day that are incredibly redundant, that remove me from being top of license?\u201d Southerlan said. Now, she said there are \u201cso many pockets of pilots at all healthcare organizations, and they haven\u2019t figured out how to take them further \u2014 but they also haven\u2019t had the guts to say, \u2018This isn\u2019t working: Shut it down.\u2019\u201d Evaluating what to keep and what to ditch isn\u2019t a matter of looking at straight cost or efficiency gains, according to Andrew Rebhan, senior consulting director at Vizient. He said that some tools billed as cost saving measures \u2014 such as notetaking tools \u2014 didn\u2019t actually save clinicians much time during pilots. But that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re a failure \u2014\u00a0Rebhan says providers should measure return on investment in terms of qualitative metrics like user experience. \u201cIs it alleviating some of the burdens of administrative work? Is it taking away some of the mundane, repetitive tasks that they\u2019re often bogged down with day to day?\u201d Rebhan asked. \u201cI think it\u2019s some of those softer metrics that may be in play here that are actually helping to sustain these tools.\u201d At AdventHealth, Shaw takes a utilitarian approach to choosing AI investments, telling Healthcare Dive that his system invests in tools that benefit the most patients. AdventHealth is currently pursuing ambient listening tools and \u201csmart\u201d patient rooms, where providers can meet with patients via Microsoft Teams on their TV. No matter how providers prioritize projects, Southerlan suggests they streamline. \u201cI think healthcare needs to taper a little bit in terms of just constantly trying to produce more widgets faster, to start to think about the efficiency and effectiveness of the tools that we\u2019re using,\u201d Southerlan said.

Grand Kartal Hotel near the northwestern town of Bolu (Demiroren News AAgency) A huge fire killed at least 76 people Tuesday as it ripped through a hotel at a popular ski resort in northern Turkey that was packed with people enjoying the winter holidays, including families. The blaze at the Grand Kartal Hotel in Kartalkaya broke out around 3:30 am (0030 GMT), sending huge clouds of smoke into the night air and sparking panic among the guests. \"Unfortunately the number of dead is now 76,\" said Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya on Tuesday night, updating an earlier figure of 66 dead. He said 52 of the victims had been identified so far with forensic experts working to determine the identities of the others. Most of the victims' bodies had been returned to their families, he added. Survivors and eyewitnesses spoke of scenes of desperation as people tried to flee the flames with some leaping out of windows or using bedsheets as a makeshift rope. \"People on the upper floors were screaming. They threw bedsheets out of the windows, some tried to jump,\" Atakan Yelkovan, who escaped from the third floor with his wife, told IHA news agency. A very shaken hotel employee, who did not give his name, said he saw guests at their windows screaming for help. \"I saw a father with his baby in his arms asking for pillows so he could throw down his son. Luckily he waited for the emergency services who saved them,\" he told IHA. \"But on the top floor, two women threw themselves out of the window and died,\" he said, explaining that students were staying on the top floor. - Peak ski season\u00a0- Tragedy struck at peak season for the ski hotel, which stands at 2,000 metres above sea level and was almost full for the two-week winter break which began on Friday. The interior minister said 238 guests had been staying at the hotel. Alongside the dead, another 51 people were injured. Health Minister Kemal Memisoglu said 17 had been discharged and 34 were still in hospital, one in intensive care. Yerlikaya said nine people had been arrested in connection with the blaze, updating an earlier figure of four, with investigators looking into the cause of the fire, possible negligence and who was responsible. Among those under investigation was the hotel's owner. - Screaming for help - One survivor, Eylem Senturk, said she and her daughter managed to get out despite the thick black smoke on their landing but her husband was trapped. \"Although he was right behind us, he couldn't get downstairs due to the smoke so he jumped from the window to the porch below,\" she told Anadolu news agency, adding that he had then jumped to safety on a car roof. Story Continues At least three people who tried to climb out of the windows fell to their deaths, NTV said. The fire is thought to have started in the restaurant and quickly spread through the hotel which was covered with wooden cladding. The cause was not immediately clear. Among the dead was a journalist who worked for the Sozcu daily, who perished with his wife and two adult children, the newspaper said in a statement. - 'Great pain' - \"Our pain is great,\" President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, declaring a national day of mourning on Wednesday, and vowing that those responsible would be \"held to account\". Tourism Minister Nuri Ersoy said the hotel had two fire escapes and had passed a fire inspection \"in 2024\" but some survivors said there appeared to be no safety mechanisms in place. \"There was no alarm, no smoke detector and no fire escape, even though there was smoke all the way up to the 10th floor,\" said a tearful man who had been at the hotel since Sunday and was interviewed by several TV channels. And Yelkovan, who escaped from the third floor, told IHA: \"No fire alarm went off.. and there was no fire escape,\" adding that it had taken \"between an hour and an hour-and-a-half\" for the firefighters to arrive. After the flames were finally doused, footage from inside showed the blackened lobby filled with charred wooden furniture and shattered glass. As Turkey counted the dead, condolences poured in from leaders such as EU chief Ursula von der Leyen, Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky, Russia's Vladimir Putin, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Greek premier Kyriakos Mitsotakis. fo-hmw/rlp View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard Recommended Stories", "symbol": "GUTS", "date":

Sergio Conceicao is trying to put some bite into his AC Milan players' performances (Piero CRUCIATTI) Sergio Conceicao has been in charge of AC Milan for less than a month but has already diagnosed a lack of hunger as the source of his new team's woes, as the seven-time kings of Europe host Girona on Wednesday with the last 16 of the Champions League firmly in their sights. Milan could yet obtain direct qualification as they sit a point away from the top eight positions and have two winnable final fixtures in the league phase, first their lowly Spanish opponents at the San Siro and then at Dinamo Zagreb next week. But Saturday's 2-0 defeat at Juventus highlighted the same issues of quality and character that have become increasingly evident with each season that has passed since their dramatic league title win in 2022. Milan are a whopping 19 points behind Serie A leaders Napoli but more importantly sit eight points from Italy's top four, making the club's minimum requirement of qualification for next season's edition of Europe's elite competition a difficult task. \"The first step to winning a match is wanting to win it,\" said Conceicao after his team's fully deserved loss in Turin. \"I don't want to hear anything about tiredness or lack of energy, it's only January for goodness sake. The players have everything they need to recover in time to play every three days. What we need is an empty fridge at home, more hunger.\" Charismatic Conceicao was hired to shake up a Milan team long been considered to be lacking fight, and the Portuguese was visibly displeased at his players after they crumbled to their first defeat since he replaced Paulo Fonseca in the dugout last month. The 50-year-old had already publicly blasted his team when he described Milan's first-half display against relegation-threatened Cagliari, a match which finished 1-1, the worst he'd ever seen as a coach. But the vehemence with which he called out his players for lacking guts was surprising even if it earned him praise from pundits and disgruntled fans alike. \"I started coaching 13 years ago I was in charge of smaller teams, teams that in terms of talent weren't all that but had an incredible level of desire,\" said Conceicao. \"In life you need to grow, have goals, even more so when you play for Milan. You have to maintain that hunger, that desire and maintain your own personal goals as a player so that when you get to the end of your career you're proud of what you've done. \"What I'm seeing here isn't new to me, I've watched almost all of Milan's matches (this season). It's down to me to change the attitude of the players. It's my responsibility.\" Story Continues Conceicao has some credit in the bank both for guiding Milan to the Italian Super Cup earlier this month and the way they won the final, coming back from two goals down to beat local rivals Inter Milan 3-2. Milan have also had to deal with absences to key players -- Christian Pulisic and Alvaro Morata the latest big-name casualties -- but failure to beat a Girona team on just three points would only further darken the mood among fans who have been calling for American owners RedBird to sell the club. td/jc View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard Recommended Stories", "symbol":

Szu Ping Chan Mon, Jan 20, 2025, 9:00 AM 6 min read Madeleine Alexander-Grout says she has received tens of thousands of pounds from the Access to Work scheme - TikTok/Madaboutmoneyofficial Thousands of people with self-diagnosed mental health conditions are using a \u00a369,000-a-year disability benefits scheme following a rise in advice from ADHD \u201csickfluencers\u201d on social media. Spending on the Access to Work scheme \u2013 which can hand claimants nearly \u00a370,000 a year for equipment and support, including work coaches, noise-cancelling headphones and Apple smartwatches \u2013 surged to \u00a3258m in the last financial year, up 40pc from 2022-23. The Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) is increasingly alarmed at the spiralling cost of the scheme, with around a third of all demand now driven by people claiming financial support for mental health conditions, up from just 5pc a decade ago. A search on social media reveals dozens of users highlighting the benefits of Access to Work, which was initially launched to help deaf and blind people. One user, Madeleine Alexander-Grout, claims to have received tens of thousands of pounds from the scheme in the last two years to help run her businesses, which provide financial advice and coaching to people with ADHD. Many claimants get less than the full annual amount from the scheme, and no one with a mental health or behavioural condition is known to have claimed \u00a369,000 in a single year. Ms Alexander-Grout, who has almost 70,000 followers on TikTok and has previously discussed her medical diagnosis for ADHD, said she had claimed \u00a313,000 in one year and \u00a356,000 in another. She has since promoted walk-through guides on social media to help others claim benefits, has offered coaching services and is releasing a book about money and ADHD. In one post, she said: \u201cIn my first year, I got \u00a313,000 but I realised I needed more support workers because I have got two businesses. Both of them are really busy and there is stuff I just can\u2019t manage to do. \u201cAnd before you all kick off and say \u2018you don\u2019t look disabled\u2019, I have multiple hidden disabilities and neurodivergent conditions.\u201d Ms Alexander-Grout did not respond to requests for comment. Spiralling costs relating to Access to Work have led officials in the Department of Work and Pensions (DW) to raise concerns with Secretary of State Liz Kendall, as they fear it is eating up a growing share of day-to-day spending. A long-running battle with the Treasury over funding is also intensifying ahead of a three-year spending review, with DWP officials demanding the scheme be moved into the broader welfare budget that is used to fund Universal Credit. Access to Work was first introduced in 1994 to make working life easier for disabled people. People can apply for a maximum of \u00a369,260 each year \u2013 twice the average wage \u2013 to help pay for adjustments, and do not have to be medically diagnosed with a health condition or disability to be eligible for support. Story Continues Grants were initially used to help deaf and blind people start work by providing special equipment, as well as practical support including sign language interpreters. However, analysis of DWP figures shows that \u201cmental health condition\u201d is now the most cited primary reason for a claim, overtaking people granted support because they are deaf or hard of hearing in 2018. Mental health was cited as the primary reason behind 22,000 of the 67,000 payment approvals in the last financial year, with learning difficulties now the second most common condition. A decade ago, just 1,000 out of 24,000 claims were associated with people claiming for mental health. The rise in claims associated with mental health has also pushed up the cost of support, which has doubled in real terms in just seven years. This included \u00a321m for \u201cspecial aids and equipment\u201d, including smartwatches, fidget toys, noise-cancelling headphones and wobble boards \u2013 almost double the previous year. Spending on support workers jumped 40pc to \u00a3178m. Whitehall sources said the rise in spending on support workers, including interpreters and specialist coaches to help people with ADHD, was of particular concern. \u201cIt\u2019s a mess,\u201d said one source. \u201cAnd it means the scheme will cost much more than was allocated at the last spending review \u2013 probably double.\u201d Fears are mounting as the scheme gains prominence on social media and online, as disabled and chronically ill users encourage people to apply. Social media users who highlight available benefits were dubbed \u201csickfluencers\u201d in a Channel 4 documentary last year. Deepwrk, a company that provides time management services for people with ADHD, claims an application can be \u201cas quick as 20 minutes\u201d. Its website lists all of the equipment available to users if they successfully apply to Access to Work, ranging from weighted blankets for stress, an Apple Watch for time management and an under-desk treadmill for hyperactivity. Other benefits include sophisticated desk chairs and noise-cancelling headphones, with the Government also providing support workers, ADHD coaching and therapy. Government guidance says applicants must have a disability, illness or health condition that means they need support to do their job, with ADHD, autism and dyslexia listed as examples alongside wheelchair use and Down\u2019s syndrome. Claimants must work more than one hour a week and are required to fill in their employer\u2019s contact details. The guidance adds: \u201cYou do not need to be diagnosed with a condition to apply.\u201d DWP has already made attempts to crack down on a rise in claims related to support workers \u2013 including ADHD coaching \u2013 reducing the hourly costs that can be reimbursed under the scheme from \u00a3450 to \u00a3205. A DWP spokesman said they did not comment on specific cases, but insisted that \u201cany support provided is vetted by trained staff to ensure it is appropriate and proportionate\u201d. Labour pledged to overhaul the scheme in its manifesto, including reducing a growing backlog of applications that threatens to pile further financial pressure on the Government. It came as a separate Lords report warned the current health benefits system was not fit for purpose, adding that Labour\u2019s drive to get NHS waiting lists down would do little to reduce economic inactivity. A cross-party House of Lords committee called for urgent reform of the system, warning that perverse incentives to claim health-related benefits instead of unemployment benefits were helping to drive Britain\u2019s worklessness crisis . The report said: \u201cOnce in receipt of them they have neither the incentive nor support to find and accept a job. Work doesn\u2019t pay.\u201d Lord Bridges, the chairman of the committee, added: \u201cIt needs to be overhauled, and urgently,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work for anybody, and it\u2019s obvious that it\u2019s not financially sustainable. It\u2019s failing both in terms of the fiscal position and in social terms. We can\u2019t keep kicking the can down the road.\u201d Separate research found that British workers took an average of nine days off for poor mental health last year compared with just four for general health issues. The study was carried out by employee benefits provider, Unum UK, which also warned that a third of employees across Britain had suffered mental health problems last year, suggesting a widespread challenge across the workforce. A DWP spokesman said: \u201cAccess to Work is aimed at helping disabled people overcome barriers within the workplace. \u201cWe recognise that the benefits system needs reform which is why we are expecting to publish major proposals to reform health and disability benefits this spring, so those who can work, do work, and those who need support get it in a way that\u2019s fair on the taxpayer.\u201d Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.
