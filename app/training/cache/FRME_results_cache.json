Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once. First Western , which belongs to the Zacks Banks - Midwest industry, posted revenues of $23.37 million for the quarter ended December 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.90%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $22.41 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. First Western shares have lost about 7.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 3.5%. What's Next for First Western? While First Western has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

"Old Second Bancorp, Inc. Reports Fourth Quarter 2024 Net Income of $19.1 Million, or $0.42 per Diluted Share Old Second Bancorp Inc. Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 12:35 AM 15 min read In This Article: OSBC -0.69% AURORA, IL / ACCESS Newswire / January 22, 2025 / Old Second Bancorp, Inc. (the \"Company,\" \"Old Second,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" and \"our\") (NASDAQ:OSBC), the parent company of Old Second National Bank (the \"Bank\"), today announced financial results for the fourth quarter of 2024. Our net income was $19.1 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to net income of $23.0 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024, and net income of $18.2 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted net income, a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes certain nonrecurring items, as applicable, was $20.3 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $23.3 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024, and $19.1 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2023. The adjusting item impacting the fourth quarter of 2024 included $1.5 million of transaction-related expenses due to the early December 2024 purchase of five branches from First Merchants Bank (\"FRME\"). The adjusting items impacting the third quarter of 2024 included $471,000 of FRME transaction-related expenses; the adjusting items impacting the fourth quarter of 2023 results included $1.2 million of nonrecurring litigation expense. See the discussion entitled \"Non-GAAP Presentations\" below and in the full release found at www.oldsecond.com , under the investor relations tab; the tables beginning on page 17 provide a reconciliation of each non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP equivalent. Net income decreased $3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.5 million increase in provision for credit losses, as well as a $5.0 million increase in noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to the prior linked quarter. These reductions to the current quarter's net income were partially offset by a $1.0 million increase in net interest and dividend income and a $1.0 million increase in noninterest income. Net income increased $885,000 in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily due to a decrease of $4.5 million in provision for credit losses, an increase in noninterest income of $2.9 million, and an increase in net interest income of $349,000. The year over year fourth quarter increase is partially offset by a $7.3 million increase in noninterest expenses. Story Continues Operating Results Fourth quarter 2024 net income was $19.1 million, reflecting a $3.8 million decrease from the third quarter of 2024, and an increase of $885,000 from the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted net income, as defined above, was $20.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, a decrease of $3.0 million from adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2024, and an increase of $1.2 million from adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2023. Net interest and dividend income was $61.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, reflecting an increase of $1.0 million, or 1.7%, from the third quarter of 2024, and an increase of $349,000, or 0.6%, from the fourth quarter of 2023. We recorded a net provision for credit losses of $3.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to a net provision for credit losses of $2.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, and a net provision for credit losses of $8.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Noninterest income was $11.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.0 million, or 9.7%, compared to $10.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, and an increase of $2.9 million, or 33.0%, compared to $8.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Noninterest expense was $44.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, an increase of $5.0 million, or 12.8%, compared to $39.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, and an increase of $7.3 million, or 19.7%, compared to $37.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. We had a provision for income tax of $6.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to a provision for income tax of $6.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 and a provision for income tax of $6.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate for each of the periods presented was 24.7%, 23.1%, and 26.9%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate in the third and fourth quarters of 2024, compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, reflects the new state ruling regarding tax rate apportionment factors related to income generated from securities or loans originated in other states. On January 21, 2025, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.06 per share of common stock, payable on February 10, 2025, to stockholders of record as of January 31, 2025.

Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Jim Eccher said \"Old Second reported strong results in the fourth quarter of 2024 with exceptional profitability and positive trends in a number of verticals. Tangible book value per share increased by more than fifteen percent on a year over year basis inclusive of the dilution associated with a branch purchase transaction in the fourth quarter. We believe we are being proactive in addressing commercial loans facing deterioration from higher interest rates, declining appraisal values and cash flow pressures. Importantly, classified and criticized loans have declined meaningfully both year over year and linked quarter and are now at their lowest levels since June 2022. We have seen previously identified loans work toward resolution and the pace of upgrades relative to downgrades has improved dramatically. Losses realized in the fourth quarter in both the loan portfolio and in OREO write downs drive the expectation of further meaningful reduction in nonperforming assets early in 2025. Exceptional profitability has afforded Old Second the opportunity to aggressively address problem acquired credits and position us to deliver improved performance in 2025. Fourth quarter return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity were 1.34% and 13.79%, respectively, the tax equivalent net interest margin was stable at 4.68% and the efficiency ratio is a very healthy 57.12%. This strong bottom-line performance and a well-positioned balance sheet drove an increase in the tangible common equity capital ratio to 10.04% from 8.53% last year end, in light of the strength of the balance sheet and resilient income statement and margin trends. In summary, we are proud of the sustainability of our performance this year and believe we are well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities that we believe will come our way in the near future.\" Asset Quality & Earning Assets Nonperforming loans, comprised of nonaccrual loans plus loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing, totaled $30.3 million at December 31, 2024, $52.3 million at September 30, 2024, and $68.8 million at December 31, 2023. Nonperforming loans, as a percent of total loans, were 0.8% at December 31, 2024, 1.3% at September 30, 2024, and 1.7% at December 31, 2023. The decrease in the fourth quarter of 2024 for nonperforming loans is driven by net nonaccrual loans outflows of $23.3 million, partially offset by $1.3 million of net inflows of loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing. Nonaccrual loan outflows consist of $8.9 million paid off, largely driven by one commercial real estate - investor loan of $6.6 million, a $13.0 million commercial real estate - owner occupied relationship transferred to OREO, $8.3 million of partial principal reductions from payments, and $3.2 million of upgrades. The nonaccrual outflows were partially offset by additions of $10.0 million, primarily driven by one large commercial real estate - owner occupied relationship. Total loans were $3.98 billion at December 31, 2024, reflecting a decrease of $9.7 million compared to September 30, 2024, and a decrease of $61.6 million compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease year over year was largely driven by the declines in commercial, commercial real estate-owner occupied and multifamily portfolios. Average loans (including loans held-for-sale) for the fourth quarter of 2024 totaled $4.00 billion, reflecting an increase of $36.3 million from the third quarter of 2024, and a decrease of $13.4 million from the fourth quarter of 2023. Available-for-sale securities totaled $1.16 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to $1.19 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The unrealized mark to market loss on securities totaled $68.6 million as of December 31, 2024, compared to $56.2 million as of September 30, 2024, and $84.2 million as of December 31, 2023, due to market interest rate fluctuations as well as changes year over year in the composition of the securities portfolio. During the quarter ended December 31, 2024, we had security purchases of $84.9 million, and security maturities, calls and paydowns of $101.2 million, compared to security purchases of $22.7 million and security calls and paydowns of $31.3 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, we had security purchases of $9.2 million and $81.6 million of maturities, calls, and paydowns, which resulted in net realized losses of $2,000. We may continue to buy and sell strategically identified securities as opportunities arise. Non-GAAP Presentations Management has disclosed in this earnings release certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and measure our performance, including the presentation of adjusted net income, net interest income and net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis, and our efficiency ratio calculations on a taxable equivalent basis. The net interest margin fully taxable equivalent is calculated by dividing net interest income on a tax equivalent basis by average earning assets for the period. Consistent with industry practice, management has disclosed the efficiency ratio including and excluding certain items, which is discussed in the noninterest expense presentation on page 7 of the full earnings release, found at www.oldsecond.com , under the investor relations tab. We consider the use of select non-GAAP financial measures and ratios to be useful for financial and operational decision making and useful in evaluating period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenditures or assets that we believe are not indicative of our primary business operating results or by presenting certain metrics on a fully taxable equivalent basis. We believe these measures provide investors with information regarding balance sheet profitability, and we believe that management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, analyzing, and comparing past, present and future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, and we strongly encourage investors to review the GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release and not to place undue reliance upon any single financial measure. In addition, because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. The tables are found in the full earnings release at www.oldsecond.com , under the investor relations tab, beginning on page 17, which provide a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP equivalent.

The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements, (1) the strength of the United States economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which we conduct our operations may be different than expected; (2) the rate of delinquencies and amounts of charge-offs, the level of allowance for credit loss, the rates of loan growth, or adverse changes in asset quality in our loan portfolio, which may result in increased credit risk-related losses and expenses; (3) changes in legislation, regulation, policies, or administrative practices, whether by judicial, governmental, or legislative action; (4) risks related to pending or future acquisitions, if any, including execution and integration risks; (5) adverse conditions in the stock market, the public debt market and other capital markets (including changes in interest rate conditions) could have a negative impact on us; (6) changes in interest rates, which has and may continue to affect our deposit and funding costs, net income, prepayment penalty income, mortgage banking income, and other future cash flows, or the market value of our assets, including our investment securities; (7) elevated inflation which causes adverse risk to the overall economy, and could indirectly pose challenges to our clients and to our business; and (8) the adverse effects of events beyond our control that may have a destabilizing effect on financial markets and the economy, such as epidemics and pandemics, war or terrorist activities, essential utility outages, deterioration in the global economy, instability in the credit markets, disruptions in our customers' supply chains or disruption in transportation, and disruptions caused from widespread cybersecurity incidents.

Estimates Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 3:10 PM 3 min read In This Article: CBSH -1.39% Commerce Bancshares (CBSH) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.01 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.94 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.84 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 7.45%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this bank holding company would post earnings of $1 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.07, delivering a surprise of 7%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times. Commerce , which belongs to the Zacks Banks - Midwest industry, posted revenues of $422.08 million for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.68%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $393.3 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Commerce shares have added about 5.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.9%. What's Next for Commerce? While Commerce has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Commerce: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Upgraded to Buy: Here's What You Should Know Zacks Equity Research Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 8:00 PM 3 min read In This Article: FRME -0.77% First Merchants (FRME) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices. The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system. Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements. As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for First Merchants is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price. Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock. Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for First Merchants imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher. Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>. Story Continues Earnings Estimate Revisions for First Merchants For the fiscal year ending December 2024, this bank is expected to earn $3.38 per share, which is a change of -13.1% from the year-ago reported number. Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for First Merchants. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0.1%. Bottom Line Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term. You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>> The upgrade of First Merchants to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.
