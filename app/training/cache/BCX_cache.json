[{"text": "LIVE The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs Certain BlackRock Closed-End Funds Announce Tender Offer in Conjunction with Results of the Quarterly Measurement Period of their Discount Management Programs Business Wire Fri, Jan 3, 2025, 12:30 AM 8 min read In This Article: BCX BGY BME BDJ BGR NEW YORK, January 02, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--The BlackRock closed-end funds (the \"Funds\") listed below announced today the results of the Quarterly Measurement Period (as defined below) under their previously announced discount management programs (the \"Programs\"). Funds with a Trigger Event (as defined below) at the end of the Quarterly Measurement Period also announced the dates of tender offers. The Programs are part of the Funds\u2019 ongoing efforts to manage discounts and enhance long-term shareholder value and provide liquidity to the market for their common shareholders. There can be no assurances as to the effect that a Program will have on the market for a Fund\u2019s shares or the discount at which a Fund\u2019s shares may trade relative to its NAV. As previously announced, under the Programs, each Fund intends to offer to repurchase a portion of its outstanding common shares based on 3-month measurement periods (each a \"Measurement Period\") if the Fund's common shares trade at an average daily discount to net asset value (\"NAV\") of greater than 7.50% during a Measurement Period (a \"Trigger Event\"). The Funds\u2019 Measurement Period commenced on October 1, 2024 and ended on December 31, 2024 (the \"Quarterly Measurement Period\"). The average daily discount to NAV for each of the Funds during the Quarterly Measurement Period is summarized below. Quarterly Measurement Period Discount Results for the Funds in the Program Fund Name Ticker Average Daily Discount for the Measurement Period ended December 31, 2024 BlackRock Capital Allocation Term Trust BCAT -5.19% BlackRock ESG Capital Allocation Term Trust ECAT -4.71% BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust BIGZ -10.52% BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust BMEZ -10.91% BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust BSTZ -9.58% BlackRock Enhanced Global Dividend Trust BOE -10.36% BlackRock Energy and Resources Trust BGR -8.74% BlackRock Enhanced International Dividend Trust BGY -10.08% BlackRock Enhanced Large Cap Core Fund, Inc.

MVF -8.28% BlackRock Utilities, Infrastructure, & Power Opportunities Trust BUI -1.35% The Funds\u2019 Boards of Directors/Trustees (the \"Boards\") determined that if a Trigger Event occurred during the Quarterly Measurement Period with respect to a Fund, the Fund would offer to repurchase a portion of its outstanding common shares by conducting a tender offer for 2.5% of its outstanding common shares at a price equal to 98% of the Fund\u2019s NAV per share as determined as of the close of the regular trading session of the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") on the next day the NAV is calculated after the expiration date of the tender offer or, if the offer is extended, on the next day the NAV is calculated after the day to which the offer is extended. As a result of the occurrence of a Trigger Event during the Quarterly Measurement Period with respect to each of the following Funds, the Board of each such Fund has authorized the Fund\u2019s tender offer with the anticipated commencement and expiration dates outlined below. Story Continues Event MVF, BME BGR, BIGZ, BMEZ, CII BGY, BSTZ, BOE, BCX Tender Offer Commencement Date Tuesday, January 21, 2025 Wednesday, January 22, 2025 Thursday, January 23, 2025 Tender Offer Expiration Date and Time Thursday, February 20, 2025 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, unless otherwise extended Friday, February 21, 2025 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, unless otherwise extended Monday, February 24, 2025 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, unless otherwise extended If more than 2.5% of a Fund's outstanding common shares are tendered, the Fund will purchase its shares from tendering shareholders on a pro rata basis at a price equal to 98% of the Fund's NAV per share as determined as of the close of the regular trading session of the NYSE on the next day the NAV is calculated after the expiration date of the tender offer (or, if the offer is extended, on the next day the NAV is calculated after the day to which the offer is extended). Accordingly, there is no assurance that a Fund will purchase all of a shareholder\u2019s common shares tendered in the tender offer. Payments for shares tendered and accepted are expected to be made within approximately five business days after the expiration date. The terms and conditions of each Fund\u2019s tender offer will be set forth in an Offer to Purchase, a related Letter of Transmittal, and related documents, which will be distributed to the respective Fund's common shareholders. As soon as its tender offer commences, each Fund will file a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), which will include an Offer to Purchase and related Letter of Transmittal.

A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the shareholder\u2019s investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with \u2018yield\u2019 or \u2018income\u2019. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund\u2019s net asset value per share. The amounts and sources of distributions reported are only estimates and are being provided to you pursuant to regulatory requirements and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon each Fund\u2019s investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.

The amount distributed per share under a Plan is subject to change at the discretion each Fund\u2019s Board. Each Plan will be subject to ongoing review by the Board to determine whether the Plan should be continued, modified or terminated. The Board may amend the terms of a Plan or suspend or terminate a Plan at any time without prior notice to the Fund\u2019s shareholders if it deems such actions to be in the best interest of the Fund or its shareholders. The amendment or termination of a Plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares.

Negative Points The administrative process for the Swiftnet exit is delayed, awaiting ICASA's approval, which could impact future plans. Despite improvements, the company still faces challenges with legacy revenue streams, which are declining. There is ongoing restructuring within BCX, including a Section 189 process, indicating internal challenges. The company has not seen a significant increase in device sales despite market changes, which could impact revenue growth. Roaming costs, although reduced, remain a factor, and the company acknowledges it will never be completely roaming-free. Q & A Highlights Q : Can you provide an update on the capacity of the mobile network given the strong growth in mobile broadband subscribers? Also, there was a payment to Google of about ZAR1 billion. Is this a one-time payment or should it be expected to continue? A : The key driver behind mobile growth is our spectrum and the fact that over 75% of our towers are on fiber. We will continue to invest in core capacity. The Google payment was a one-time payment, but we have a long-term arrangement with Google that involves back-to-back agreements. Q : Are you expecting accelerating operational trends in the next few quarters, and how do you see the demand for consumer and IT services in South Africa? A : We are maintaining a positive outlook and expect operational trends to continue positively. There is an increasing demand for consumer services, particularly in the SME segment, where we are focusing our efforts. Story Continues Q : How does the Competition Tribunal's decision to block the Vodacom and Maziv merger affect your pursuit of investors for Openserve? A : The decision has no impact on our Openserve strategy. We have suspended discussions on partnerships for Openserve and remain focused on our InfraCo strategy, which is yielding positive results. Q : What drove the substantial margin improvement in Mobile, and when do you expect top-line growth to accelerate? A : The margin improvement in Mobile is due to a combination of revenue growth and cost efficiencies, including reduced roaming costs. We expect top-line growth to accelerate as next-generation revenue becomes a larger portion of our total revenue. Q : Can you clarify if there will be any cash outflow from moving from a defined benefit to a defined contribution plan, and are there any more liability payments related to Google? A : There is no cash impact on Telkom's free cash flow from the retirement fund transition. The Google transaction involves back-to-back contracts with both revenue and payment elements, but the initial payments were once-off.
