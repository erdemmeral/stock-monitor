4:37 PM 2 min read In This Article: ARMK TORONTO , Jan. 23, 2025 /CNW/ - Aramark\u00a0Canada , one of the country's largest food service providers, announced today\u00a0its pioneering step as the first Canadian contract catering company to commit to the Coolfood Pledge , a science-based target to reduce food-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 25 percent by 2030. The move represents a deeper involvement with the World Resources Institute's Coolfood initiative, which helps the food industry slash GHG emissions in line with cutting edge climate science. aramark Logo (CNW Group/Aramark Canada Ltd.) This initiative is a cornerstone of Aramark's sustainability strategy, \" Be Well. Do Well .,\" aimed at creating a positive impact on both people and the planet. The move bolsters Aramark's global sustainability efforts and advances its commitment to setting science-based targets, including its path to net-zero emissions by 2050; since nearly half of the company's greenhouse gas emissions come from the food it purchases and serves. \"Since we introduced WRI's Coolfood Meals program to our Higher Education partners three years ago, we have seen the demand for climate-friendly and plant-forward meal choices continue to grow across multiple business segments,\" said Michael Yarymowich , Director of Sustainability at Aramark Canada. \"Signing the Coolfood Pledge is the next step in our collaborative partnership with WRI to significantly reduce GHG emissions, providing our teams with a clearly defined goal, while at the same time underlining our commitment to fighting climate change.\" Aramark Canada has been serving low carbon certified Coolfood meals in select universities since 2022. These low carbon meals are third party verified by\u00a0WRI's experts and allow diners to quickly identify options that are delicious and better for the planet. The success of these offerings has paved the way for introducing Coolfood Meals to hundreds of additional Canadian locations, making it even more convenient for guests to make climate-friendly food choices in Higher Education, Business Dining, and Healthcare dining facilities across Canada through 2025 and beyond. Today's announcement builds on Aramark's existing Coolfood program and partnership with WRI. The company currently offers more than 3000\u00a0Coolfood meals across more than 1000 accounts in the United States and in 2022 became the first contract caterer in the US to sign the Coolfood Pledge, thereby establishing a bold standard for reducing food-related emissions within the industry. \"With its enormous reach, Aramark's commitment to cut food's climate impact sends a message to the entire industry that this is the future of dining,\" said Jenny Arthur , Head of Coolfood at World Resources Institute. \"We're excited about the positive feedback from Aramark's consumers, too. It goes to show that sustainable menu offerings can be as delicious and exciting as many classic dishes.\" Story Continues For more information on Aramark Canada's sustainability initiatives and to explore their ongoing environmental efforts, visit Aramark Canada's Environmental, Social, and Governance page .

Solicit Alternative Bids and Sell the Company CLEVELAND, January 27, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Ancora Holdings Group, LLC (collectively with its affiliates, \"Ancora\" or \"we\"), a diversified investment firm that oversees approximately $10 billion in assets, today issued the below open letter to the Board of Directors (the \"Board\") of United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) (\"U.S. Steel\" or the \"Company\") regarding a variety of issues, including the Company\u2019s recently blocked sale to Nippon Steel Corporation (\"Nippon\"). To receive important updates, visit www.MakeUSSteelGreatAgain.com . *** January 27, 2025 United States Steel Corporation 600 Grant Street Pittsburgh, PA 15219 Attn: The Board Dear Members of the Board, Ancora is a growing shareholder of U.S. Steel. As an investment firm with deep roots in the Midwest, we have an affinity for the industrial and logistics companies that collectively form the backbone of America\u2019s economy. We are proud to be investors in companies such as Berry Global Group, Inc., Norfolk Southern Corporation, RB Global, Inc. and now U.S. Steel. Owning these types of businesses enables us to pursue strong risk-adjusted returns while helping support American competitiveness, job creation and wage growth. Although we understand why the Board explored strategic alternatives in 2023, its ultimate decision to ignore national security and pursue a risky sale to Nippon \u2013 an overseas bidder that came in just $1 per share higher than a competing domestic bidder \u2013 has led to a dead end. There appears to be no legal basis and no precedent for U.S. Steel\u2019s costly litigation over the Presidential Executive Order blocking the transaction. Moreover, President Donald Trump is a vocal opponent of the deal and long-term proponent of strengthening America\u2019s domestic manufacturing base. He also has long-held skepticism about foreign direct investment from Japan based on his own business dealings dating back to the 1980s. We see no reason to believe that President Trump, a high-conviction businessman who was elected by middle-class and working-class voters, is going to contradict his self-described \"America First\" agenda and disregard the opposition of the United Steelworkers. Story Continues The Board\u2019s choice to double down on its extremely poor decision to pursue a sale to Nippon has also kept U.S. Steel in a corroded state. Chief Executive Officer David Burritt, who stood to rake in more than $70 million himself if the sale had been consummated, has been allowed to misallocate capital, issue unreliable and overoptimistic forecasts, and repeatedly miss financial targets. It seems the Board failed to keep Mr. Burritt\u2019s attention on efficiency, execution and risk management as steel prices remained depressed over the past year. Rather than finally acknowledge the Company\u2019s perilous trajectory and try to course correct, the Board remains steadfastly committed to an underperforming leader who apparently lacks the ability and vision to bring U.S. Steel back from a busted transaction. In light of these alarming decisions and the unjustifiable deference to Mr. Burritt, who has made clear through outlandish rhetoric that he is self-interested and unfit for leadership, Ancora has nominated nine highly qualified, independent candidates for election to the Board at U.S. Steel\u2019s 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Our slate includes individuals with corporate governance experience, finance expertise, industrials and manufacturing backgrounds, public policy acumen and other qualifications critical to turning around a standalone U.S. Steel. The slate\u2019s plan includes installing Alan Kestenbaum, a steel industry legend who delivered total shareholder returns of more than 450% at Stelco Holdings Inc., as a replacement for Mr. Burritt. We expect the investment community will agree that any steel company would be fortunate to have Mr. Kestenbaum assume such a role. Our slate and Mr. Kestenbaum look forward to ultimately releasing their full plan for enhancing U.S. Steel\u2019s corporate governance, cost structure, labor relations, margins, operations and long-term viability as a force within the American economy. With the tailwind of President Trump\u2019s agenda, including steel tariffs, our nominees are confident they will shift the Company\u2019s strategy from hoping to be saved to implementing a multi-year plan that targets meaningful share price appreciation. The Case for Wholesale Change: The Board Has Doubled Down on its Bad Decision to Pursue a Risky Sale \u2013 Even After the Sale was Blocked by Executive Order We want to take this opportunity to share a few key facts. First and foremost, no transaction blocked by Presidential Executive Order after a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has ever gone through. This means there is no legal precedent for the litigation brought by U.S. Steel and Nippon earlier this month. Although U.S. Steel seems to be holding out hope that it can convince President Trump to approve the deal, the facts indicate that this is a pipe dream. President Trump has repeatedly voiced opposition to the transaction and has long been skeptical of deals with Japanese businesses. 1 In fact, just last month he stated \"I am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company, in this case Nippon Steel of Japan [\u2026] As President, I will block this deal from happening.\" 2 Nothing he has said since former President Joseph Biden\u2019s Executive Order indicates a change of heart. In addition to the aforementioned headwinds, the blocked deal also faced opposition from Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a bipartisan contingent of high-profile lawmakers and the United Steelworkers. When they were in the Senate, Messrs. Vance and Rubio previously co-authored a letter to then-Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen to stress that \"[t]he transaction was not entered into with U.S. national security in mind.\" 3 It should be clear as day that U.S. Steel is now fighting a binding Executive Order, the Trump administration, an array of senators and representatives, and a multitude of third parties that do not buy into Mr. Burritt\u2019s self-serving arguments. The Board should also be aware of what independent and objective legal experts have to say: \"Unfortunately for Nippon Steel, their argument is not particularly strong. The president's action in this case is explicitly excluded from judicial review under U.S. law.\" - Akira Inoue, partner, Baker & McKenzie 4 \"The D.C. Circuit is unlikely to overturn the blocking order based solely on allegations of pre-determination or the appearance of a sham process. Substantial evidence of constitutional violations or procedural defects is normally required. In addition, there does not appear to be a process for taking evidence, so the sham argument cannot be developed beyond what is in the public record.\" - Ken Nunnenkamp, partner, Morgan Lewis 5 \"Nippon and U.S. Steel face a formidable uphill battle in challenging CFIUS' referral and the president's exercise of authority to block the deal on national security grounds. Congress intended to shield CFIUS' decisions, and the president's conclusions under the CFIUS regime, from virtually all judicial review, an approach that is consistent with broad judicial deference to the executive branch on national security matters.\" - Mario Mancuso, George W. Hicks Jr. and Lucille Hague, partners, Kirkland & Ellis 6 It borders on delusional to think that the Trump administration would use precious political capital at the start of its term to reverse its public position on the transaction, not to mention undermine its clearly articulated focus on revitalizing American manufacturing and insourcing. The Case for Wholesale Change: The Board Has Allowed a Conflicted, Underperforming CEO to Hinder U.S. Steel\u2019s Credibility and Undermine the Company\u2019s Future Ancora has a proven track record of correctly identifying companies that are held back by conflicted or unfit CEOs. Before we seek the removal of a CEO, we typically try to work with a board of directors to address and course correct the executive\u2019s shortcomings. In this case, however, we see no future with Mr. Burritt. In our view, Mr. Burritt exhibited disqualifying behavior on January 3 rd , when he issued a statement that called former President Biden\u2019s decision \"shameful and corrupt . \" He continued what appeared to be a tirade by calling highly respected United Steelworkers President David McCall a \" union boss,\" effectively questioning his integrity. 7 We also need to scrutinize the Board\u2019s oversight of Mr. Burritt in light of his public accusation that the prior administration made a decision that supports the Chinese Communist Party. It runs counter to the interests of shareholders, to which Mr. Burritt owes a fiduciary duty, to make seemingly unhinged and retaliatory statements about plans \"to fight President Biden\u2019s political corruption.\" 8 Regardless of political leanings, this is not how standard public company executives act. Perhaps this is why Jeh Johnson, former Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, abruptly resigned from the Board in recent weeks. Since before the sale to Nippon was announced, Mr. Burritt also appears to have diverted his focus from U.S. Steel\u2019s operations. For example, on the conference call for the Nippon sale announcement, analysts noted that Big River\u2019s EBITDA per ton was down roughly 59% and the mini-mill cost per ton was up roughly 23% following the 2021 Big River acquisition. 9 Mr. Burritt\u2019s response to this was tone deaf: \"we feel absolutely wonderful about this Big River facility. And with Big River 2, it's going to be even more remarkable.\" 10 When U.S. Steel reported fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings only six weeks later, it revealed $12 million of costs related to Big River, which had the effect of reducing the mini-mill segment\u2019s EBITDA to just $74 million. 11 Unfortunately for shareholders, the trend of excess costs at Big River has continued unabated. On September 19, 2024, the Company disclosed that the mini-mill segment\u2019s adjusted EBITDA would be lower than the previous quarter, impacted by $40 million of costs from the Big River 2 mini-mill. 12 The Company followed this with a vague cautionary note on December 19, 2024, stating Big River 2 \"ramp-related costs exert pressure on the quarter.\" 13 In addition to unrelenting Big River cost overruns, U.S. Steel has consistently missed earnings estimates over the past year and a half while lagging its peers. Notably, during Mr. Burritt\u2019s tenure, the Company\u2019s total shareholder returns have underperformed peers by a staggering 227.7%. Total Shareholder Returns* 1-year 5-year Burritt CEO Tenure U.S. Steel -7.7% -21.3% 13.5% Peer Median 24.9% 180.6% 241.2% Relative Performance -32.2% -201.9% -227.7% Source: FactSet and Bloomberg. Peers include Commercial Metals Company, Cleveland-Cliffs Inc., Reliance, Inc., Steel Dynamics, Inc. and Nucor Corporation. *Total shareholder returns as of market close August 11, 2023, the last trading day prior to the Company\u2019s disclosure of initiating a strategic alternatives process. Mr. Burritt\u2019s election by the Board to assume the CEO role was announced May 10, 2017. Key Performance Metrics** Revenue Growth Adjusted EBITDA Growth CapEx Growth Free Cash Flow Growth U.S. Steel 19.7% -25.6% 336.6%*** -225.7% Peer Median 38.3% 15.5% 79.2% 55.0% Relative Performance -18.6% -41.1% 257.4% -280.7% **Key performance metrics measured from figures reported by U.S. Steel and peers from Q2 2021 to Q3 2024. These dates reflect the start of the economic recovery from COVID and the most recently reported quarter. ***CapEx Growth is based on incurred expenses and likely does not yet reflect U.S. Steel's $600 million budget expansion for Big River 2. U.S. Steel is now in a dire state due to its excessive capital spending, high debt, soft earnings and nonexistent contingency plan. While Mr. Burritt may not care due to what seem to be his jet-setting ways, we believe the city of Pittsburgh and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have been put at economic risk by his sale aspirations and mismanagement of the Company. There are consequences associated with having out-of-touch leadership with weak involvement in local communities. Absent a miracle, Ancora believes a substantial and urgent reconstitution of the Company\u2019s leadership is necessary. An Alternative Path Forward: Our Slate and Mr. Kestenbaum Want to Make U.S. Steel Great Again in the Public Market Ancora has nominated a fit-for-purpose slate with nine highly qualified individuals, whose complementary skills make them greater than the sum of their parts. Each is a leader in his or her respective field and is able to draw on prior public company experience to help set a viable go-forward strategy. Our nominees include individuals with experience in corporate governance, executive leadership, finance, logistics, manufacturing, regulatory affairs and strategic transactions. They come to the Board free of the incumbents\u2019 past mistakes, open-minded, and committed to producing enduring value for shareholders and stakeholders. Importantly, the slate includes industry heavyweight Alan Kestenbaum, the former Chairman and CEO of Stelco, as a CEO candidate for U.S. Steel. If our slate\u2019s campaign is successful, Mr. Kestenbaum will bring to the role a uniquely close relationship with the United Steelworkers, expertise in identifying and operating undervalued assets, and an unrelenting commitment to delivering the best possible results. Most notably, Mr. Kestenbaum has a history of turning U.S. Steel\u2019s failed endeavors into home runs. Look no further than what he accomplished at Stelco, a company U.S. Steel put into bankruptcy. Mr. Kestenbaum acquired Stelco for approximately $53 million, only to later sell it for more than $2 billion. 14 In the process, he enriched his shareholders through the success of a turnaround, whereas U.S. Steel\u2019s investors received virtually nothing for the asset. Considering the significant underperformance of U.S. Steel\u2019s operations and Mr. Burritt\u2019s underwhelming results as a leader, Mr. Kestenbaum represents a massive upgrade on all fronts. If elected, our slate and its CEO candidate are committed to the following: Pursuing the $565 million breakup fee that U.S. Steel needs based on Mr. Burritt\u2019s own statements regarding the prospect of potential facility closures and layoffs. Immediately ending the current Board\u2019s spending spree on Wall Street advisors, which we estimate to be a nine-figure sum over the past 18 months. Revamping the executive leadership team to be full of operators residing near facilities and plants. Restoring relations with labor union members and leaders, community organizations and elected officials. Releasing a clear standalone strategy so investors have transparency about priorities for capital allocation, operations and production, and other commercial initiatives. Protecting Mon Valley Works and other facilities Mr. Burritt has threatened to close. It\u2019s important to highlight that Mr. Kestenbaum\u2019s track record as a CEO includes increasing employment everywhere he has been. Not soliciting acquisition proposals from Cleveland-Cliffs, Inc. or any other partner (domestic or foreign). Please note that despite the sale to Nippon being blocked this month, you \u2013 the Board \u2013 decided to keep a January deadline for director candidate nominations in an apparent effort to insulate yourselves. We complied with your deadline despite being in the process of amassing a meaningful stake that will be disclosed in due course. Make no mistake, Ancora, as well as Mr. Kestenbaum, intend to build meaningful positions as sale pipe dreams fade and the Company\u2019s share price continues resetting from what have been artificially inflated levels. In closing, our goal here is straightforward: make U.S. Steel great again for the benefit of employees, customers, shareholders and all other stakeholders who want a bright future for this American icon. Only under a new Board and management team do we believe this is possible. Regards, Fredrick D.

Troy Set to Release Q3 Earnings: Should You Expect a Beat? 1 / 2 NUS Q4 Preliminary Revenues Reach Top End of Outlook, Stock Gains 9.8% Zacks Equity Research Mon, Jan 6, 2025, 4:52 PM 4 min read In This Article: HELE KMB ARMK SMPL Helen of Troy Limited HELE is likely to register a top and bottom-line decline when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings on Jan. 8. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $530.4 million, implying a 3.5% decrease from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings has remained unchanged in the past 30 days at $2.61 per share, indicating a 6.5% fall from the figure reported in the year-ago period. HELE has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 4.6%, on average. Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar. Helen of Troy Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Helen of Troy Limited price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Helen of Troy Limited Quote Factors Likely to Influence HELE\u2019s Upcoming Results Helen of Troy is navigating a challenging macroeconomic environment characterized by reduced consumer and retailer demand. Consumers are facing financial constraints and prioritizing essential purchases over discretionary items. This has been impacting the company\u2019s sales. We expect a 4% drop in organic volumes in the third quarter. Helen of Troy has also been grappling with rising SG&A expenses. In the second quarter, the rise in the consolidated SG&A ratio was mainly due to elevated marketing expenses, increased distribution center costs linked to automation issues at the Tennessee facility and unfavorable operating leverage. The persistence of any of these factors is a concern. Our model suggests a 90-basis point expansion in adjusted SG&A (as a percentage of sales) to 32.8% for the quarter under review. Due to external headwinds, including increased promotional activity, softer and more variable retail replenishment and ongoing macroeconomic pressures and uncertainty, management revised parts of its fiscal 2025 forecast in the second-quarter earnings release. This also raises concerns for the third quarter. For the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the company expects a decline in sales of 1-4.5%, while the adjusted EPS is likely to decrease 3-10%. However, strength in the Leadership Brands has been working well for Helen of Troy. The company\u2019s strategic initiatives, focusing on strengthening core operations and refining its growth portfolio, have also been offering respite. By leveraging a data-driven approach, the company is improving brand fundamentals. Expansion efforts in key international markets and the optimization of distribution networks are expected to have aided sales performance. Apart from this, HELE\u2019s global restructuring plan, Project Pegasus, is likely to have generated savings.

news and updates on Trump's tariffs Investors in Aramark (NYSE:ARMK) have seen respectable returns of 33% over the past year editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 9:53 PM 3 min read In This Article: ARMK The simplest way to invest in stocks is to buy exchange traded funds. But one can do better than that by picking better than average stocks (as part of a diversified portfolio). To wit, the Aramark ( NYSE:ARMK ) share price is 31% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market return of around 22% (not including dividends) in the same period. That's a solid performance by our standards! The longer term returns have not been as good, with the stock price only 3.3% higher than it was three years ago. So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 1 year and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Aramark In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price. During the last year, Aramark actually saw its earnings per share drop 42%. Given the share price gain, we doubt the market is measuring progress with EPS. Therefore, it seems likely that investors are putting more weight on metrics other than EPS, at the moment. We doubt the modest 1.1% dividend yield is doing much to support the share price. However the year on year revenue growth of 8.2% would help. Many businesses do go through a phase where they have to forgo some profits to drive business development, and sometimes its for the best. The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail). NYSE:ARMK Earnings and Revenue Growth January 14th 2025 Aramark is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. If you are thinking of buying or selling Aramark stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst consensus estimates for future profits . A Different Perspective It's good to see that Aramark has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 33% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 4%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Aramark better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should learn about the 2 warning signs we've spotted with Aramark (including 1 which is a bit unpleasant) .

2024, 3:16 PM 3 min read In this article: ARMK While Aramark ( NYSE:ARMK ) might not have the largest market cap around , it saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$42.22 and falling to the lows of US$36.96. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Aramark's current trading price of US$37.67 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Aramark\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Aramark What Is Aramark Worth? According to our valuation model, Aramark seems to be fairly priced at around 13.04% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Aramark today, you\u2019d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $33.32, then there isn\u2019t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it\u2019s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Aramark\u2019s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company\u2019s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity. Can we expect growth from Aramark? NYSE:ARMK Earnings and Revenue Growth December 25th 2024 Future outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Aramark's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value. What This Means For You Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in ARMK\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value? Are you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on ARMK, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.
