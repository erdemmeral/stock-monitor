(GGG) Misses Q4 Earnings and Revenue Estimates Zacks Equity Research Tue, Jan 28, 2025, 1:20 AM 3 min read In This Article: GGG -1.02% Graco Inc. (GGG) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.64 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.76 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.80 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -15.79%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $0.76 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.71, delivering a surprise of -6.58%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once. Graco , which belongs to the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry, posted revenues of $548.67 million for the quarter ended December 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.99%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $566.64 million. The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Graco shares have added about 1.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 3.7%. What's Next for Graco? While Graco has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Graco: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.67 on $524.9 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.05 on $2.24 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Reports Sales Below Analyst Estimates In Q4 Earnings, Stock Drops Kayode Omotosho Tue, Jan 28, 2025, 12:17 AM 6 min read In This Article: GGG -1.02% Graco (NYSE:GGG) Reports Sales Below Analyst Estimates In Q4 Earnings, Stock Drops Fluid and coating equipment company Graco (NYSE:GGG) missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q4 CY2024, with sales falling 3.2% year on year to $548.7 million. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.64 per share was 15.8% below analysts\u2019 consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Graco? Find out in our full research report . Graco (GGG) Q4 CY2024 Highlights: \u201cWe continued to experience slower demand across many end markets in the fourth quarter\u201d Revenue: $548.7 million vs analyst estimates of $556.8 million (3.2% year-on-year decline, 1.5% miss) Adjusted EPS: $0.64 vs analyst expectations of $0.76 (15.8% miss) Operating Margin: 23.7%, down from 30% in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $14.5 billion \u201cWe continued to experience slower demand across many end markets in the fourth quarter,\" said Mark Sheahan, Graco's President and CEO. Company Overview Founded in 1926, Graco (NYSE:GGG) is an industrial company specializing in the development and manufacturing of fluid-handling systems and products. Gas and Liquid Handling Gas and liquid handling companies possess the technical know-how and specialized equipment to handle valuable (and sometimes dangerous) substances. Lately, water conservation and carbon capture\u2013which requires hydrogen and other gasses as well as specialized infrastructure\u2013have been trending up, creating new demand for products such as filters, pumps, and valves. On the other hand, gas and liquid handling companies are at the whim of economic cycles. Consumer spending and interest rates, for example, can greatly impact the industrial production that drives demand for these companies\u2019 offerings. Sales Growth A company\u2019s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. While any business can experience short-term success, top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Regrettably, Graco\u2019s sales grew at a tepid 5.1% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This fell short of our benchmark for the industrials sector and is a rough starting point for our analysis. Graco Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss cycles, industry trends, or a company capitalizing on catalysts such as a new contract win or a successful product line. Graco\u2019s recent history shows its demand slowed as its revenue was flat over the last two years. We also note many other Gas and Liquid Handling businesses have faced declining sales because of cyclical headwinds. While Graco\u2019s growth wasn\u2019t the best, it did perform better than its peers. Story Continues Graco Year-On-Year Revenue Growth We can dig further into the company\u2019s revenue dynamics by analyzing its most important segments, Contractor and Process, which are 45% and 24.8% of revenue. Over the last two years, Graco\u2019s Contractor revenue () was flat while its Process revenue (pumps, valves, hoses) averaged 1.5% year-on-year growth. This quarter, Graco missed Wall Street\u2019s estimates and reported a rather uninspiring 3.2% year-on-year revenue decline, generating $548.7 million of revenue. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 7.6% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus the last two years. This projection is above average for the sector and implies its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance. Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefiting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link . Operating Margin Operating margin is a key measure of profitability. Think of it as net income - the bottom line - excluding the impact of taxes and interest on debt, which are less connected to business fundamentals. Graco has been a well-oiled machine over the last five years. It demonstrated elite profitability for an industrials business, boasting an average operating margin of 26.9%. This result isn\u2019t surprising as its high gross margin gives it a favorable starting point. Looking at the trend in its profitability, Graco\u2019s operating margin rose by 3.2 percentage points over the last five years, showing its efficiency has improved. Graco Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP) In Q4, Graco generated an operating profit margin of 23.7%, down 6.3 percentage points year on year. Since Graco\u2019s operating margin decreased more than its gross margin, we can assume it was recently less efficient because expenses such as marketing, R&D, and administrative overhead increased. Earnings Per Share Revenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions. Graco\u2019s EPS grew at an unimpressive 7.9% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. On the bright side, this performance was better than its 5.1% annualized revenue growth and tells us the company became more profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded. Graco Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) We can take a deeper look into Graco\u2019s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Graco\u2019s operating margin declined this quarter but expanded by 3.2 percentage points over the last five years. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its higher earnings; taxes and interest expenses can also affect EPS but don\u2019t tell us as much about a company\u2019s fundamentals. Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business. For Graco, its two-year annual EPS growth of 2.5% was lower than its five-year trend. We hope its growth can accelerate in the future. In Q4, Graco reported EPS at $0.64, down from $0.80 in the same quarter last year. This print missed analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Graco\u2019s full-year EPS of $2.77 to grow 11.2%. Key Takeaways from Graco\u2019s Q4 Results Graco's revenue and EPS both fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Management simply stated that the company \u201c...continued to experience slower demand across many end markets in the fourth quarter\u201d. Overall, this was a weaker quarter. The stock traded down 6.4% to $80.51 immediately following the results. Graco\u2019s latest earnings report disappointed. One quarter doesn\u2019t define a company\u2019s quality, so let\u2019s explore whether the stock is a buy at the current price. What happened in the latest quarter matters, but not as much as longer-term business quality and valuation, when deciding whether to invest in this stock.

2025, 12:10 AM 11 min read In This Article: GGG -1.02% MINNEAPOLIS, January 27, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Graco Inc. (NYSE: GGG) today announced results for the fourth quarter ended December 27, 2024. Summary $ in millions except per share amounts Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Dec 27, 2024 Dec 29, 2023 % Change Dec 27, 2024 Dec 29, 2023 % Change Net Sales $ 548.7 $ 566.6 (3 )% $ 2,113.3 $ 2,195.6 (4 )% Operating Earnings 130.0 169.9 (23 )% 570.1 646.8 (12 )% Net Earnings 108.7 110.0 (1 )% 486.1 506.5 (4 )% Diluted Net Earnings per Common Share $ 0.63 $ 0.64 (2 )% $ 2.82 $ 2.94 (4 )% Adjusted (non-GAAP): (1) Operating Earnings, adjusted $ 137.7 $ 169.9 (19 )% $ 577.8 $ 646.0 (11 )% Net Earnings, adjusted $ 110.1 $ 137.1 (20 )% $ 477.1 $ 523.9 (9 )% Diluted Net Earnings per Common Share, adjusted $ 0.64 $ 0.80 (20 )% $ 2.77 $ 3.04 (9 )% (1) Excludes impacts of business reorganization charges, excess tax benefits from stock option exercises, impairment charges, contingent consideration fair value adjustments, pension settlement losses and certain non-recurring tax provision adjustments. See Financial Results Adjusted for Comparability below for a reconciliation of adjusted non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. Net sales for the fourth quarter decreased 3 percent, with decreases in all regions. Incremental sales from acquired operations partially offset the decrease and contributed 3 percentage points of growth for the quarter. The gross profit margin rate declined approximately 2 percentage points for the fourth quarter, including approximately a 1 percentage point impact from the unfavorable effects of lower margin rates from acquired operations. Lower sales volume and higher product costs more than offset realized pricing and further reduced the gross margin rate. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter increased $19 million, and included $7 million of incremental litigation costs in the Contractor segment associated with a trial that concluded in December of 2024, $7 million of business reorganization costs and $7 million of expenses from acquired operations. Operating earnings decreased 23 percent for the fourth quarter as lower sales volume and higher operating expenses drove the decline in operating earnings. Adjusted to exclude the effects of the business reorganization and other prior year items, operating earnings decreased 19 percent. Net earnings decreased 1 percent for the fourth quarter. Adjusted net earnings decreased 20 percent due to lower operating earnings and a higher effective income tax rate. Story Continues \"We continued to experience slower demand across many end markets in the fourth quarter,\" said Mark Sheahan, Graco's President and CEO. \"Soft demand for Industrial products in China, lower sales of semiconductor equipment and the timing of projects in the powder coatings equipment business were notable headwinds. We completed the Corob acquisition in November that contributed 3 percent of sales growth in the quarter. The strategic fit between Corob and our Contractor Division will serve us well in the future, and we welcome this business, and its dedicated employees into the Graco family. While 2024 has been challenging from a growth standpoint, I would like to thank our employees, suppliers, and distributors for their continued dedication and hard work.\" Consolidated Results Net sales for the fourth quarter decreased 3 percent from the comparable period last year. Fourth quarter net sales decreased 1 percent in the Americas, decreased 2 percent in EMEA, and decreased 10 percent in Asia Pacific (9 percent at consistent translation rates). Net sales for the year decreased 4 percent compared to last year (3 percent at consistent translation rates). Net sales for the year decreased 1 percent in the Americas, decreased 2 percent in EMEA (3 percent at consistent translation rates) and decreased 16 percent in Asia Pacific (15 percent at consistent translation rates). For the quarter, changes in currency translation rates decreased net sales by approximately $2 million. For the year, changes in currency translation rates decreased net sales by approximately $6 million (1 percentage point). Acquired operations contributed approximately 3 percentage points of sales growth for the quarter and 1 percentage point for the year. The gross profit margin rate declined approximately 2 percentage points for the fourth quarter, including approximately a 1 percentage point impact from the unfavorable effects of lower margin rates from acquired operations. Lower sales volume and higher product costs more than offset realized pricing and further reduced the gross margin rate. For the year, the gross profit margin rate increased slightly as the favorable effects of realized pricing more than offset unfavorable product and channel mix and higher product costs. Total operating expenses increased $19 million (15 percent) for the fourth quarter and $38 million (7 percent) for the year, respectively, compared to last year. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter included $7 million of incremental litigation costs in the Contractor segment associated with a trial that concluded in December of 2024, $7 million of business reorganization costs and $7 million of expenses from acquired operations. Operating expenses for the year included $13 million of incremental litigation costs associated with the aforementioned trial, $7 million of business reorganization costs, $7 million of expenses from acquired operations and $13 million of investments in new product development and other growth initiatives, including the relocation to a new distribution center. Reductions in volume and earnings-based expenses of $6 million for the quarter and $14 million for the year partially offset the increase in operating expenses. Interest expense was flat for the fourth quarter and $2 million lower for the year compared to the same periods last year as private placement debt was repaid in the third quarter of 2023. Excluding a prior year pension settlement loss of $42 million, other income increased $3 million for the fourth quarter and $13 million for the year, largely due to increased interest income. The effective income tax rate was 18 percent for both the quarter and year. Adjusted to exclude certain non-recurring items (see Financial Results Adjusted for Comparability below), the adjusted effective income tax rate was 22 percent for the quarter and 20 percent for the year, up approximately 2 percentage points and 1 percentage point, respectively, from the same periods last year largely due to the unfavorable effects of foreign earnings taxed at higher rates than the U.S. Segment Results Management assesses performance of segments by reference to operating earnings excluding unallocated corporate expenses. For a reconciliation of segment operating earnings to consolidated operating earnings, refer to the segment information table included in the financial statement section of this release. Certain measurements of segment operations are summarized below: Three Months Twelve Months Contractor Industrial Process Contractor Industrial Process Net Sales (in millions) $ 246.9 $ 165.7 $ 136.1 $ 988.9 $ 619.7 $ 504.8 Percentage change from last year Sales 3 % (14 )% 0 % 0 % (7 )% (8 )% Operating earnings (30 )% (27 )% (3 )% (5 )% (14 )% (14 )% Operating earnings as a percentage of sales 2024 20 % 31 % 27 % 27 % 33 % 28 % 2023 29 % 37 % 28 % 29 % 35 % 30 % Components of net sales change by geographic region for the Contractor segment were as follows: Three Months Twelve Months Volume and Price Acquisitions Currency Total Volume and Price Acquisitions Currency Total Americas (5)% 3% 0% (2)% (2)% 1% 0% (1)% EMEA (3)% 13% 0% 10% (1)% 3% 0% 2% Asia Pacific 10% 25% (1)% 34% 6% 6% (2)% 10% Consolidated (3)% 7% (1)% 3% (1)% 2% (1)% 0% Sales from acquired operations more than offset continued weakness in North American construction markets and led to a 3 percent increase in sales in the Contractor segment for the fourth quarter. The operating margin rate in the fourth quarter and year was 9 percentage points and 2 percentage points lower, respectively, than the same periods last year due to higher product costs on lower sales volumes, the unfavorable effects of lower margin rates of acquired operations, and litigation costs associated with a trial that concluded in December of 2024. Components of net sales change by geographic region for the Industrial segment were as follows: Three Months Twelve Months Volume and Price Acquisitions Currency Total Volume and Price Acquisitions Currency Total Americas (8)% 0% (1)% (9)% 4% 0% 0% 4% EMEA (10)% 0% 0% (10)% (4)% 0% 0% (4)% Asia Pacific (24)% 0% (1)% (25)% (22)% 0% (2)% (24)% Consolidated (13)% 0% (1)% (14)% (6)% 0% (1)% (7)% Industrial segment sales decreased in all applications for the quarter and year due to weakened global industrial economic activity and the timing of powder finishing system sales. The operating margin rate for this segment decreased 6 percentage points and 2 percentage points, respectively, for the fourth quarter and year due to higher product costs, business reorganization expenses and the unfavorable effects of product and channel mix. Components of net sales change by geographic region for the Process segment were as follows: Three Months Twelve Months Volume and Price Acquisitions Currency Total Volume and Price Acquisitions Currency Total Americas 7% 0% 0% 7% (3)% 0% 0% (3)% EMEA (7)% 0% 1% (6)% (10)% 0% 1% (9)% Asia Pacific (12)% 0% 0% (12)% (20)% 0% (1)% (21)% Consolidated 0% 0% 0% 0% (8)% 0% 0% (8)% Process segment sales were flat in the fourth quarter as sales growth in the Americas from all product applications offset declines in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Although the rate of decline slowed in the fourth quarter, sales decreased in all regions and most product applications for the year. The operating margin rate for this segment decreased approximately 1 percentage point for the quarter and 2 percentage points for the year as price realization was more than offset by unfavorable expense leverage on lower sales volume. Outlook \"We are initiating a full year outlook for 2025 of low single-digit sales growth on an organic, constant currency basis,\" said Sheahan. \"Incoming orders were consistent through much of the year, including the fourth quarter. Demand in China and for semiconductor products appear to have stabilized, and we are expecting growth in these areas in 2025. Our reorganization into global businesses, centered around common customers and distributors, has been completed and our teams are positioned to drive incremental profitable growth as a result. Our acquisition pipeline is solid and we are hopeful that we will see actionable opportunities in the coming year. Graco remains strong with excellent employees who remain committed to our core growth strategies of developing new products, expanding distribution, seeking adjacent markets and new geographies, and pursuing strategic acquisitions.\" 2025 Change in Organizational Structure As previously announced, effective January 1, 2025, the Company has classified its business into three reportable segments: Contractor, Industrial and Expansion Markets. The Industrial segment consists of the newly formed Industrial Division and the Powder Division. The Company\u2019s former Industrial and Lubrication Equipment Divisions, along with the Process Transfer Equipment business that was part of the Company\u2019s former Process Division, were combined to form the new global Industrial Division. The Powder Division remains unchanged. The Expansion Markets segment consists of the Expansion Markets Division and will focus on driving inorganic growth in new and adjacent markets. The Company\u2019s environmental, semiconductor, high-pressure valves and electric motors businesses, together with select future ventures and acquisitions, reside within this division. The Contractor segment, consisting of the Contractor Division, remains unchanged as a reporting segment relative to prior periods. Segment operating results will be reported under the new organizational structure for the first quarter of 2025. Segment information recast to conform to the new organizational structure is available as unaudited supplemental financial information on the Company\u2019s website at www.graco.com . Financial Results Adjusted for Comparability Excluding the impacts of business reorganization charges, excess tax benefits from stock option exercises, impairment charges, contingent consideration fair value adjustments, pension settlement losses and certain non-recurring tax provision adjustments presents a more consistent basis for comparison of financial results.

What to Know Ahead of Q4 Release Zacks Equity Research Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 6:00 PM 5 min read In This Article: DOV -0.69% GGG -1.02% The market expects Dover Corporation (DOV) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates. The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 30, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.08 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -15.1%. Revenues are expected to be $1.98 billion, down 6.2% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.25% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change. Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Story Continues Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Dover? For Dover, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.10%. On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3. So, this combination indicates that Dover will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue? Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Dover would post earnings of $2.16 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.27, delivering a surprise of +5.09%. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times. Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Dover appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release. An Industry Player's Expected Results Another stock from the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry, Graco Inc. (GGG), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.76 per share for the quarter ended December 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -5%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $552.15 million, down 2.6% from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Graco has been revised 0.4% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 1.32%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 5 Quality Compounder Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

week as one-year returns increased after a 3.6% gain last week editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 1:51 PM 4 min read In This Article: GGG -1.02% Key Insights Institutions' substantial holdings in Graco implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price A total of 18 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a business Every investor in Graco Inc. ( NYSE:GGG ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 88% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. Last week\u2019s 3.6% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The one-year return on investment is currently 2.6% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed. In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Graco. See our latest analysis for Graco NYSE:GGG Ownership Breakdown January 22nd 2025 What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Graco? Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. Graco already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Graco's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. NYSE:GGG Earnings and Revenue Growth January 22nd 2025 Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Graco. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 10% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.4% by the third-largest shareholder. Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 18 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. Story Continues Insider Ownership Of Graco While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Graco Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$141m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public Ownership The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 11% stake in Graco. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders. Next Steps: I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.
