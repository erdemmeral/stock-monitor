shrugged off Trump\u2019s \u2018trade war\u2019 \u2212 there\u2019s no reason it won\u2019t do the same with new tariffs Yu Zhou, Vassar College Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 5:10 PM 7 min read When it comes to slowing down China's tech rise, tariffs won't do the trick. Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images When Donald Trump returns to the White House, he\u2019ll be accompanied by a coterie of China hawks , all vowing to use tariffs and export bans to stop Beijing from challenging the United States\u2019 supremacy in technology. This isn\u2019t entirely new; China has faced such trade pressure since Trump first became president in 2017 , and it has continued through the Biden administration . But the scale of what Trump now proposes \u2013 he has mentioned tariffs of up to 60% on goods from China \u2013 has some commentators suggesting that it could, in the words of one analyst, \u201ckeep Beijing on the defensive and permanently transform the rivalry in America\u2019s favor.\u201d Such a view is premised on the belief that China\u2019s outdated, state-subsidized, manufacturing-for-export model is ripe for disruption by U.S. tariffs. But as someone who has studied China\u2019s technology since the early 2000s and written and edited two books on China and innovation , I believe this portrayal of China\u2019s economy is at least two decades out of date. China\u2019s technological sectors have grown rapidly after 2016 by adapting to the imposition of American tariffs. Indeed, since the \u201c trade war\u201d launched by Trump in 2017, Chinese technology has actually emerged as a world leader. China\u2019s tech ascent Thirty years ago, China barely had internet access , and its best technology company was yet to produce a competitive personal computer domestically. Fifteen years ago, it was the world\u2019s factory \u2013 stuck at the low end of the value chain assembling iPhones and other tech gadgets, but not able to make any high-tech parts itself. Even with the best crystal ball in the mid-2000s, no Chinese planners could have predicted the pathways to China\u2019s technological standing today. Fast-forward to today: China is now ahead of rival economies across broad technological fields. The think tank Information Technology and Innovation Foundation found in a 2024 report that China is leading or globally competitive in five out of nine high-tech sectors \u2013 robotics, nuclear power, electric vehicles, artificial intelligence and quantum computing \u2013 and rapidly catching up in four others: chemicals, machine tools, biopharmaceuticals and semiconductors. A Bloomberg analysis similarly identified China as leading or globally competitive in 12 out of 13 technology-intensive industries. And the Australian Strategic Policy Institute found China leading in 37 of 44 critical technologies it tracked. Why has the Chinese tech industry advanced so quickly? Many in Washington believe it\u2019s the result of decades of careful government planning to dominate global high-tech industries. But this, I believe, vastly overestimates Beijing\u2019s foresight and control. The Chinese government has indeed maintained the lofty goal of catching up with the West since the 1980s, but having goals isn\u2019t the same as being able to execute them. Story Continues An employee produces semiconductor chips at a factory in China\u2019s Shandong province on Jan. 15, 2025. STR/AFP via Getty Images Many in the West also point at Chinese state subsidies propping up domestic tech firms. While subsidies have played a role in some tech successes, the Chinese government has also funded plenty of failures. Take semiconductors, for example: Despite enormous Chinese government investments since the 1990s, China still lags in producing cutting-edge chips and is reliant on imports. Dare to D.R.E.A.M. In my view, China\u2019s technological dynamism didn\u2019t come from the magic of central planning, but through five key elements I call D.R.E.A.M. . D denotes the dialogue between state and market. While China\u2019s government wields significant power, the country\u2019s private sector is neither submissive nor powerless. In 2022, firms not owned by the state \u2013 mostly private firms but also offshore firms in which Beijing does not have a controlling share \u2013 accounted for 95% of enterprise R&D spending and 88% of urban employment. While Beijing has cracked down on tech giants \u2013 it banned Alibaba\u2019s Ant Group from listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 2020, and its COVID-19 lockdown hurt its private sector \u2013 the government is not, contrary to how it is seen by many in the West, bound by strict ideology. It has recently started to voice more support for the private sector, even drafting laws to protect private companies . Indeed, it\u2019s more accurate to describe state-market relations in China as dynamic, adaptive interaction \u2013 more dialogue than dictatorship. R refers to the domestic research and development (R&D). Once reliant on imported technology, China has invested heavily in domestic research capacity over the past 20 years. Geopolitical tensions accelerated a shift toward self-reliance, but Chinese scientists and engineers remain deeply engaged in global networks. Further, a nominally anti-espionage program brought in under Trump\u2019s first administration has swelled the number of highly skilled workers in China. The \u201c China initiative \u201d introduced by the U.S. Justice Department in 2018 promoted the suspicion \u2013 often without evidence \u2013 that Chinese and Chinese American scientists might be spying for Beijing, resulting in a flood of leading scientists heading back to China . There they continued to undertake cutting-edge research and educate a new generation of Chinese scientists. E is for the industrial ecosystem China can exploit. China\u2019s vast manufacturing base enables rapid creation and scaling of new technologies. In 2023, China produced 35% of the global gross manufacturing output , being the only country covering all major industrial sectors. China may not have the innovative ecosystem of Silicon Valley, which can draw on deep venture capital and a booming stock market. But it has built comprehensive supply chains over the years, and it\u2019s exceptionally good at repurposing them to rapidly bring new products to market. Take the example of robotics. China took the robotics industry seriously only when labor costs rose sharply. In 2010, China\u2019s manufacturing labor costs were about $2 per hour , similar to the Philippines or Vietnam; by 2022, that figure rose to about $8 per hour \u2013 more than double the average of Southeast Asian countries. China now installs more industrial robots annually than the rest of the world combined, and the quality of its robots has grown by leaps and bounds. A stands for accumulative changes. Rather than aiming for novel breakthroughs, Chinese companies excel at incremental improvements \u2013 and this results in an accumulative transforming effect. The massive manufacturing networks create opportunities to improve upon existing products based on market feedback, rather than a few brilliant ideas from any leader\u2019s creative mind. Analysts in the U.S. have long expected China\u2019s rampant intellectual property violations to doom its innovation drive, the thinking being that it takes away the impetus for individuals to innovate if they believe such innovations will be stolen. Instead, as Taiwanese tech expert and writer Kai-Fu Lee has explained, Chinese enterprises can be dynamic and innovative in an environment with less IP protection. They often rapidly expand their market share and build business ecosystems to prevent followers from catching up. M means the middle market . Chinese firms tend to target middle-income consumers, both domestically and globally. By prioritizing affordability and functionality over cutting-edge innovation, they avoid head-to-head competition with Western giants such as Apple. Chinese smartphone brands such as Xiaomi and Oppo are a third to half the price of an iPhone, but with similar functionalities. Chinese electric vehicles are similarly far less expensive than Tesla but still incorporate leading features. Chinese firms tolerate lower profit margins, as they can rely on the expanded sales in the middle market, both domestically and, increasingly, overseas . A JIDU 07 electric car draws attention at the 2024 China International Auto Show in Tianjin, China, on Oct. 3, 2024. CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images Tariffs as a counterproductive measure The problem for the incoming Trump administration is that while tariffs might alter the global map of China\u2019s manufacturing and exports, they won\u2019t dismantle any of the D.R.E.A.M. elements. In fact, they could have the opposite effect of accelerating China\u2019s push for self-reliance and strengthening its foothold in global middle markets. Part of the problem is that American policymakers often see technological competition with China as a zero-sum contest. But technological competition isn\u2019t like a race with distinct lanes and a finish line. Rather, tech transformation is a complex process in which countries and companies compete, collaborate and build on each other\u2019s work. Ultimately, America\u2019s technological prowess won\u2019t be measured by how much it manages to stop China, but by how successfully American companies can address humanity\u2019s greatest challenges. Attempts to hobble the competition through tariffs and trade wars will do little toward that end.

Security and Diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute (ASPI). A veteran diplomat, he focused on the US' Asian affairs for decades and played a key role in former president Barack Obama's pivot to Asia.

I had 33 years of service to my country. During the last eight years, we worked directly for the wonderful US president Barack Obama, working on the Asia account. When Donald Trump was inaugurated [in 2017], I did stay on for several months to smooth the transition, support the new team and make sure people in the Bureau of East Asia and Pacific Affairs and in our embassies were well looked after. But I had no intention of staying under the Trump administration because it really wasn't an option for me. I felt that the values and principles of US foreign policy that I had served under for decades were being undermined and contravened by many of the policies of the Trump administration. The Chinese government has the ability to set aside sanctions if it feels doing so can serve its interests. However, the choice of figures like Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz as national security adviser signals a very hard line on China, with a greater focus on zero-sum ideological confrontation. Beijing may find it difficult to engage with a team that has shown so much interest in decoupling and containment and so little interest in compromise and engagement. That said, it is unclear how this hawkish perspective will fit with Donald Trump's overall agenda. Beijing's actions - towards its neighbours, minorities and Western countries - along with policies exploiting access to Western intellectual property and technology [and] militarisation of the South China Sea, have fuelled bipartisan mistrust of China in the United States. Figures like Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz don't emerge in isolation; their views align with many of their colleagues in the Senate, the House and the broader policy community. While there are problems and flaws in this hardline approach, it reflects widespread and often legitimate concerns about some of China's behaviours and policies. These concerns are not limited to the United States. Do you expect Trump's second term to differ from his first? Where are US-China relations headed? One thing that complicates the answer to that question is that there were different China policies under president Trump from 2017 to 2021. In 2017, Trump's policy towards China was as friendly and affectionate as one could imagine. Let's not lose sight of the fact that his first administration was not tough on China from the start. It became tough in stages, but didn't begin that way. Story Continues This reflects the inconsistency, or perhaps the impulsive nature, of Donald Trump. Some aspects of his approach remain unchanged from his first term. He is confident in his instincts, highly transactional and strongly committed to the \"America first\" brand of nationalism. Policies like tariffs are examples of this. That said, unlike in 2017 Donald Trump is no longer a beginner as president or commander-in-chief. Over four years he acquired substantial experience in governance and showed tremendous confidence in his instincts. He also appeared to have an aversion to relying on advice from his subordinates, which is a notable change from when he first took office. I suspect that, unlike his first term, Donald Trump is likely in a hurry. The midterm elections in the US are not kind to re-elected presidents. He got narrow majorities in both the House and the Senate, which will help him implement his policies, but the Democrats could flip either or both houses in 2026. That is an incentive to get as much done as quickly as he can. In a way, he has nowhere to go but down in the midterms. Moreover, he is almost 80 years old. It won't be long before much of the political world starts turning its attention to his successor, especially because he's not constitutionally eligible for another term, not to mention his age and other factors. Another difference is that attitudes towards China, both in the United States and in much of the West, have significantly hardened. There have been geopolitical shifts, and now China faces a less forgiving global environment. Additionally, China's problems - the declining economic power, issues with neighbours and challenges with debtor countries throughout the Global South - have magnified. It's also pretty clear that Donald Trump values his personal relationship with [Chinese President] Xi Jinping and seems to have some fondness for President Xi. However, he also remembers that during his first term, many of Beijing's actions - handling of Covid, crackdown on Hong Kong protests and treatment of Uygurs - cemented frustration and mistrust in Washington. It's a very different environment than it was eight years ago. Trump seems to suggest Taiwan should pay more for its defence - or might not even be worth the US defending. What should we make of his comments and his policy towards Taiwan, which has been a thorny issue between Beijing and Washington? Trump wants every US ally and partner to spend more on its own defence. His comments are consistent with what he has said to Nato, South Korea and Taiwan specifically. He seems to be messaging that the United States can't want your security more than you do. The message is clear: the US will not do more to support Taiwan's defence and its right to exist as a democratic community than Taiwan itself is willing to do. This message is not inconsistent with what the Biden, Obama or Bush administrations conveyed to authorities in Taiwan, though they did so privately. It is challenging to convey this publicly without risking the credibility of US commitments, undermining deterrence or opening the door to misinterpretation by decision-makers in Beijing. How Trump himself feels about Taiwan is unclear. However, it is clear that he values his image as a strong leader and America's image as a strong power. My expectation is that he would perceive any aggressive move against Taiwan by Beijing as a direct challenge to him, and he would not simply let it pass. While he might not act on principle, that doesn't mean he wouldn't act. Escalating military pressure by Beijing could make Taiwan's security an issue he cares about, especially if he sees it as a test of not just America's but also his own credibility Washington signed an intelligence-sharing deal with Manila recently and plans to deploy more missiles to Japan. How would these play out in US management of tension in the Taiwan Strait during Trump's second term? All the moves we see in national security by the United States, in cooperation with allies like Japan and the Philippines, are aimed at strengthening deterrence. The issue, however, is that it's difficult for one country to show resolve without potentially signalling to the other side that it has aggressive intentions. This is what experts refer to as a \"security dilemma\". One side feels threatened and defensive, so any defensive measures it takes are perceived by the other side, which also feels threatened, as actions that need to be countered. This leads to mutual suspicion, fear and an escalating cycle of tension - that's the essence of the security dilemma. You can take actions to reassure your own side, but it's very challenging to do so in a way that doesn't make Beijing feel threatened. That being said, if you compare the activities of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in the Taiwan Strait over the years - say, in 2024, compared to 2020, 2016, 2012 or 2008 - you can clearly see a sharp escalation in military threats and pressure. Given this, governments in the United States, Japan and other nations can be forgiven for thinking that Beijing is using the threat of military force to intimidate and eventually coerce or dominate Taiwan. This is unacceptable to the international community and Taiwan's security, for a variety of reasons, has now become a global concern, extending well beyond just the Asia-Pacific region. What risks do you see in the South China Sea in Trump's second term? Is there any way to avoid major conflict? The primary risk isn't necessarily the arrival of another Trump administration but rather the possibility of China testing the limits of what its neighbours and the US are willing to tolerate. There's a significant danger of accidents, miscalculations and a lack of mechanisms to prevent incidents from escalating into crises or outright conflict. Even without direct conflict, instability in the South China Sea - a vital artery for global trade - has severe economic consequences which the world can ill afford. China's use of \"grey zone\" tactics has escalated over the years. These include deploying vessels that appear to be coastguard ships but perform military functions like harassment and intimidation. While the Philippines has been a primary target, Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia have also faced such actions, raising the risk of a broader crisis. Avoiding conflict is possible. Many territorial disputes worldwide have been resolved or shelved. For example, [former Chinese leader] Deng Xiaoping once suggested postponing the resolution of a territorial dispute between China and Japan until a wiser generation could address it. This approach of shelving disputes or resolving them diplomatically remains viable. Moreover, adherence to international law, specifically the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), is crucial. Both China and the Philippines are signatories, and the UNCLOS tribunal has ruled that China's territorial claims in the Philippines' exclusive economic zone are invalid. This ruling undermines the legal basis for China's actions and highlights the need for it to withdraw paramilitary vessels from the area. Vietnam stands out for its resolute defence of sovereignty, showing no signs of submission to Beijing. While Vietnam is unlikely to align as a US treaty ally, it will continue to safeguard its national interests. Increased pressure on countries like Vietnam and the Philippines could lead to greater resistance and potentially stronger regional unity among Southeast Asian nations, particularly those in Asean. Though countries like Laos, Cambodia and Brunei may abstain, others could form a formidable bloc, a prospect likely concerning Beijing. The credit for the \"pivot to Asia\" belongs to Barack Obama. It wasn't an abstract policy experiment but a recognition of the US's vital interests in the Asia-Pacific region. Obama, having spent part of his youth in Southeast Asia and Hawaii, understood the need for a strong US presence in the region. The policy emerged as a response to the overemphasis on Middle East conflicts during the Bush administration, shifting focus to the dynamic and innovative economies of East Asia. The rebalance prioritised strengthening alliances, fostering new partnerships and engaging with China's rise constructively. Obama welcomed a stable and prosperous China, provided it adhered to international norms. However, efforts to engage China were often met with frustration as the country turned increasingly authoritarian. Congress, especially under Republican control, underfunded many initiatives tied to the rebalance. A significant regret was the US' failure to finalise its participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) , which would have cemented American leadership in trade and regional standards. Trump's withdrawal from the TPP and his America first approach further undermined US influence, alienating allies by prioritising unilateralism over shared values. Despite this, Beijing's assertive actions have pushed countries like Japan, South Korea and others in the region closer to the US. The sustainability of US commitments remains a concern, but China's behaviour has encouraged stronger alignment with Washington. The potential of alliances like Aukus and the Quad depends on whether future administrations will invest the effort needed to realise their promise. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said his past negotiations with the US only confirmed that Washington bore \"unchangeable\" hostility towards his country, and said his nuclear build-up was the only way to counter external threats. What might be the bottom line for Kim when it comes to dealing with the US? Well, first of all, North Korea's rhetoric about the US \"hostile policy\" has been something I've heard now for decades, not just from Kim Jong-un, but from [his father and grandfather] Kim Jong-il and Kim Il-sung as well. It's simply an alibi for why North Korea can do whatever it wants, including illegally pursuing weapons of mass destruction. The \"bogeyman\" image of a US hostile policy, this external threat, is a very convenient tool for domestic propaganda. It's an excuse the Kim family uses for why its promises have been broken and why its domestic policies have failed. Everything is blamed on the American hostile policy. Kim's basic bottom line is regime survival, and nuclear weapons are non-negotiable for him. The United States has been very elastic in its approach. Each of the three Kims sought a meeting with the sitting president of the United States because of the status they would gain. At the end of his term, Clinton came close to agreeing to meet Kim Jong-il but a meeting did not take place, although after leaving office he travelled to Pyongyang to gain the release of two American hostages. Kim Jong-un jumped at the opportunity to meet Donald Trump and was ready to make deals, albeit on his terms. The way to think about Kim Jong-un's ambition is that he seeks to develop his nuclear and missile systems through what's called nuclear second-strike capability. Essentially, he wants to make his arsenal large and diversified enough that he feels the US cannot risk retaliating against North Korea for any act of aggression. Even if the US decided to launch a punitive strike against North Korea, it would know that some of Kim's missiles would survive and have the ability to strike the US after Pyongyang is wiped out. That's what second-strike capability is. If Kim can reach a point where he believes he can act with relative impunity, where he feels that the US deterrent has been neutralised, I think, ironically, he'll want to negotiate. But these negotiations will be strictly on his terms. He will want to negotiate the reduction of US forces in Asia, not the reduction of his nuclear stockpile. We've already seen the results of Trump's experiment with diplomacy, and it proved that North Korea is absolutely determined to retain and expand its nuclear programme. What that means for the rest of the world is that the only realistic options are to bolster defence against North Korea and to strengthen deterrence so that North Korea never decides it's safe to commit aggression. As for the possibility of a world war involving Korea, nobody wants a nuclear war. I tend to think the probability of war is low, but it's not zero. There is a significant risk of miscalculation by Kim Jong-un that could lead to a crisis that spirals out of control. There can be no effective restraint on Kim Jong-un without US-China collaboration - absolutely impossible. If the Ukraine war truly could be ended as quickly as Trump says, how would this play out in relation to North Korea and China? That's pretty far out of my area of expertise, but I think Trump's claim that he could end the war in a day, or on his first day, is highly implausible. If he could somehow get President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to surrender, maybe it would happen, but he can't. That said, the withdrawal of US military and financial support to Ukraine would cause a lot more death and suffering for the victims of Russia's aggression. It's conceivable that Trump as the US president could engineer a ceasefire in place, but the concern is that this would only buy time for Russian forces to recover, regroup, and launch a more powerful assault against Ukraine. Putin has made clear that his goal is not just to peel off a few pieces of Ukrainian territory but to dominate and subjugate the entire nation. Right now, the war is not going well for Putin - thousands of Russians are being killed. If you have to turn to North Korea for soldiers to fight your war, it shows that your military is not doing well. Putin's aggression against Ukraine has put Beijing in a terrible position. Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a sovereign nation, a UN member, is a very fundamental principle for the [People's Republic of China], and there's just no way of viewing Putin's attack as anything other than a violation of that principle. From the very beginning, Beijing has been in an impossible situation - unable to really help Moscow, but unwilling to not help. So it's the worst of both worlds, and Beijing has lost immense credibility with Europe. It's hard to see how the Chinese government could use its strategic leverage with Moscow in concert with Europe and the United States to help broker a durable settlement. Unfortunately, I don't think the prospects for a durable resolution of the war in Ukraine look good any time soon. Russia and North Korea are becoming closer allies, with Putin bringing North Koreans in to fight for Moscow in the Ukraine war. How much influence does China still have in the Korean peninsula? How would the changing dynamics affect Japan and South Korea's ties with China? The only two people who benefit from the enhanced relationship between North Korea and Moscow are Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un. Everyone else is a loser, including China, the US and the rest of the world. From my experience, Beijing has always been very reluctant to use its leverage over North Korea, even though it has tremendous leverage. This reluctance has resulted in Beijing having very little influence. You only have influence if the other side believes in you or believes that you're willing to use it. Pyongyang has always tried to play Moscow and Beijing off against each other, but it's never been particularly successful - until now. Now, the situation has changed. First, Russia desperately needs help. Putin isn't paying North Korean mercenaries because the war in Ukraine is going well, but it is because he is desperate. Second, Pyongyang has become more successful because China's relationship with the United States is so poor. The US and China are finding it impossible to coordinate or cooperate, and these two factors have made North Korea much more powerful in terms of its ability to manipulate major powers. There's no question that an empowered North Korea hurts Beijing's interests. It dramatically raises risks, complicates China's foreign policy, and undermines regional stability. It also drives Japan and South Korea closer together and fosters more trilateral security cooperation. Furthermore, it encourages European involvement in the Asia-Pacific region, which is the last thing Beijing wants. The Moscow-Pyongyang connection creates serious complexities for China. It risks dragging China into conflicts that it doesn't want to be involved in and has badly damaged China's relationship with Europe. At a minimum, this association saddles China with reputational costs, without any tangible benefits. Beijing is not profiting in any way. In the end, China seems stuck in this association with Moscow and Pyongyang, but is clearly on the losing end of this equation. How much influence could Elon Musk have on US China policy? Will he help generate new, game-changing momentum in the space race between the two countries? That's an interesting question, and honestly, I'm not sure I'm the right person to answer it. Elon Musk has certainly achieved phenomenal success, especially in space. We have to give him immense credit for his innovation and technological expertise, not just in space but across many fields. His work has been truly impressive. We're in a complicated time because, in some ways, the private sector is outpacing governments in space technology. This is also true for other emerging tech sectors. The old pattern of military inventions flowing to the commercial sector is no longer the case; now, innovation is often coming from private companies and labs. As for how much influence Elon Musk will have, or how he might interact with the Trump administration, it's hard to predict. In US politics, there's a saying: \"The United States only has one president at a time.\" This typically applies to the transition period when the president-elect Donald Trump doesn't take office until January 20, and until then, President Joe Biden is in charge. I think that saying could apply to the relationship between Trump and Musk as well. Both are huge figures, but only one can hold the presidential office. I suspect they both feel equally qualified, and maybe, over time, the pressure will be too much, and Trump and Musk will go their separate ways. But again, it's really anyone's guess.

This compares to an enrichment factor of less than 20 for other laser-based enrichment approaches. - Commissioning of the Silicon-28 and Ytterbium-176 facilities is currently running ahead of schedule with commercial production expected to commence during the first quarter of 2025 versus previous expectations of the first half of 2025. - The first shipment of Carbon-14 feedstock is currently in transit and anticipated to arrive in South Africa in January, with the second shipment expected to arrive in February/March, allowing for expected commercial production of enriched Carbon-14 and sales during the first half of 2025. WASHINGTON, Jan. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ASP Isotopes Inc. NASDAQ: ASPI (\"ASP Isotopes\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), an advanced materials company dedicated to the development of technology and processes for the production of isotopes for use in multiple industries, today welcomes a group of 27 investors from 9 different countries to its facilities in South Africa for a two-day investor access event. The facilities tour will include our Operational Head Office, Research and Development Center, first Quantum Enrichment Laser Isotope Facility (Ytterbium-176), Carbon-14 enrichment facility, multi-isotope enrichment facility (Silicon-28) and PET Labs. Investors will also spend a morning at Pelindaba, the operational base of Necsa (South African Nuclear Engineering Corporation), which is the site where the planned joint venture between ASP Isotopes, Quantum Leap Energy and Necsa expects to construct their first advanced nuclear fuels production facility. The Company will present to investors the enrichment data that has been achieved to date using Quantum Enrichment (QE), the Company\u2019s laser-based approach to isotope enrichment. QE has delivered enrichment factors of up to 678, which have been achieved on four different elements. ASP Isotopes uses QE, not AVLIS as its laser-based enrichment approach. During the investor event, management will present data that it believes demonstrates the distinction between Quantum Enrichment and AVLIS. Published literature suggests that other laser-based approaches for isotope enrichment achieved enrichment factors of less than 20 (1) (2) . The enrichment factor achieved by QE is up to 30-fold greater and Company management believes that this could lead to production efficiencies significantly greater than anything ever achieved with AVLIS. Story continues The Company will also provide updates on the commissioning phase for both the Silicon-28 and the Ytterbium-176 facilities. We expect to commence commercial production of Silicon-28 and Ytterbium-176 during the first quarter of 2025, compared to previous expectations of the first half of 2025. The Company is also pleased to announce that it has been informed by its Canadian customer, RC14, that the first shipment of Carbon-14 feedstock is in transit and should arrive in South Africa in January. Assuming the second batch of feedstock arrives in February/March, the Company expects to produce and sell the first enriched Carbon-14 during the first half of 2025. \u201c The construction and commissioning teams have worked exceptionally hard through December and the holiday period to accelerate the commissioning phase of the Silicon-28 and Ytterbium-176 facilities. Both isotopes are urgently required; Silicon-28 to further advance next generation semiconductors and Yterrbium-176 to further advance oncology treatments that will improve patient outcomes. We look forward to an exciting 2025 with a number of key deliverables anticipated \u201d said Paul Mann, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ASP Isotopes and Quantum Leap Energy.

Isotopes Issues Letter to Shareholders ASP Isotopes Inc. Mon, Dec 16, 2024, 4:00 PM 18 min read In This Article: ASPI ASP Isotopes Inc. WASHINGTON, Dec. 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ASP Isotopes Inc. (NASDAQ: ASPI) (\"ASP Isotopes\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), an advanced materials company dedicated to the development of technology and processes for the production of isotopes for use in multiple industries, today released the following letter to shareholders from its Chairman and CEO, Paul Mann. Dear Fellow Shareholder, As the year comes towards its end, I wanted to personally write to you to summarize some of the more significant milestones the Company has achieved during 2024 and discuss our future goals for 2025. It has been a busy and successful year: The Company completed the construction of two ASP isotope enrichment facilities, with one awaiting the delivery of feedstock (Carbon-14) and the second currently in the commissioning phase (Silicon-28). The Company completed the construction of the first Quantum Enrichment facility, for Ytterbium-176, approximately 9 months ahead of schedule and under budget. This facility is currently in the commissioning phase and has already successfully produced the first semi-finished material of enriched Ytterbium-176, which is a precursor for the production of Lutetium-177, the active component of Novartis\u2019 Pluvicto, a potential blockbuster for the treatment of prostate cancer. The Company signed two contracts with U.S. based customers for the supply of highly enriched Silicon-28 to enable next generation semiconductors for quantum computing, artificial intelligence and large data centers. The Company signed a research contract and a term sheet with TerraPower for the construction of a HALEU production facility. The term sheet anticipates TerraPower providing seed capital for the construction of the facility as well as a long-term supply agreement for the production capacity of the facility. The Company signed an MOU with Nesca (South African Nuclear Engineering Corporation) to develop an advanced nuclear fuel production facility at Pelindaba, South Africa. ASPI scientists have already had \u201c Shovels in the Ground \u201d at Pelindaba and the construction of the first of two HALEU enrichment test facilities has been completed. The Company raised approximately $84 million (before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses) in a combination of debt and equity transactions and finished 3Q 2024 with approximately $51 million of cash on balance sheet. The Company\u2019s balance sheet has never been stronger. During 2024, the Company hosted over 60 investors and corporate clients to its facilities in South Africa. The company looks forward to hosting another Investor Access Event in January 2025. Story Continues The construction of two ASP Enrichment Facilities is now complete with one awaiting feedstock, and one in commissioning phase. During the last 36 months, the Company has constructed two Aerodynamic Separation Process (ASP) enrichment facilities in Pretoria, South Africa. The first is scheduled to enrich Carbon-14 and the second, a multi-isotope facility, is scheduled to enrich Silicon-28. Both of these facilities are expected to enter commercial production during 1H 2025 and the Company has entered into commercial contracts with customers for product from both. Carbon-14: Carbon-14 is used as a tracer during the development of new pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals and the entire world\u2019s supply is currently sourced from Russia. In June 2023, the Company entered into a multi-year Carbon-14 take-or-pay contract with a minimum revenue commitment of $2.5 million per annum. In late 2023, RC-14, which is our North American commercial partner, commenced the processing of the feedstock to produce enriched Carbon-14. Whilst our partner, RC-14, has produced the first batches of feedstock, they have experienced a 6-12 month delay in shipping this feedstock to South Africa. RC-14 has recently confirmed that they expect the feedstock to arrive in South Africa during 1Q 2025, which should allow for our first Carbon-14 revenues during 1H 2025. Silicon-28: Naturally occurring silicon has three isotopes: Si-28, -29 and -30. The presence of Si-29 isotope has a negative impact on the performance of silicon in semiconductor applications. Our enrichment process allows for the removal of Si-29, and production of highly enriched Silicon-28, which can conduct heat 150% more efficiently ( 1 ) than natural silicon. This will potentially allow for computer chips to become smaller, faster, cooler and more energy efficient. Highly-enriched Silicon-28 ( 28 Si) (i.e. enriched to 99.995% in the 28 isotope) is expected to be used in the next-generation of semiconductors which will enable technologies such as quantum computing and artificial intelligence (2) . Our Silicon-28 enrichment facility, located at Koedoespoort, Pretoria, is approximately 40 times the size of the Carbon-14 enrichment facility (measured on a SWU basis). This highly advanced facility utilizes a state-of-the art compression system, as well as proprietary analytical and control systems. During 2024, the Company signed two agreements for the supply of Silicon-28. One of these agreements is with a leading semiconductor company and the other with a leading industrial gas company that has a significant presence in the supply of electronic gases and chemicals. The Company is currently in discussions with multiple potential customers and expects to sign additional supply agreements during the next six months. The construction of our first Quantum Enrichment Facility is now complete and in the commissioning phase having already produced its first enriched Ytterbium-176, semi-finished product. During September 2024, the Company completed the construction of its first Quantum Enrichment Facility for Ytterbium-176 in Pretoria, South Africa. Construction of the Ytterbium-176 plant was originally planned to conclude during mid-2025; however, the team accelerated its construction timeline by approximately nine months. During October 2024, the Company produced the first semi-finished material of enriched Ytterbium-176. The Company believes that this proprietary technology is not only more efficient and scalable than other enrichment technologies, but also has considerable advantages with respect to capital efficiency and industrial pollution. The Company expects to be able to offer Ytterbium-176, enriched to 99.75%, at competitive prices and terms compared to other suppliers, with greater reliability and a significantly improved environmental footprint. Ytterbium-176 ( 176 Yb) is a key stable isotope used in the production of Lutetium-177 ( 177 Lu). Lutetium-177 is an emerging beta emitting radiopharmaceutical used in oncology drugs such as Novartis\u2019 Pluvicto. There are currently two FDA approved drugs and more than 66 ongoing clinical trials for drugs that require Lutetium-177. Consensus forecasts for Novartis\u2019 Pluvicto exceed $4 billion and the beta emitting radiopharmaceutical market is expected to exceed $15 billion per annum in the next decade ( 3 ) . The supply chain for this radioisotope has been particularly challenged with recent industry reports highlighting over two months\u2019 treatment delay due to lack of drug availability ( 4) . Based on the results of the commissioning phase of the Ytterbium-176 plant, the Company is now accelerating plans to construct Nickel-64 and Lithium-6/7 plants in South Africa. There is an urgent need for all three isotopes from Western-based producers. Nickel-64 is currently used to produce Copper-64, in a cyclotron, and based on discussions with potential customers, has significant supply-side challenges. Copper-64 is a positron and beta emitting isotope of copper, with applications for molecular radiotherapy and positron emission tomography. Lithium-7 is currently used as an alkalizing agent for the coolant in Pressure Water Reactors (PWRs) and it is predicted that Lithium-7 will be used as part of the molten lithium fluoride in molten-salt reactors which are expected to become used in the nuclear energy industry next decade. Western supplies of Lithium-7 are currently provided by Russia. It is widely anticipated that Lithium-6 will be required to enable nuclear fusion power plants, which are currently in development. It is widely anticipated that nuclear fusion will be one of the cleanest forms of energy, with potential for low carbon baseload energy with no long-lived radionuclide waste. There is currently no producer of Lithium-6 in commercial quantities, yet most power plant designs need tonnage of Lithium-6 for operations. With 93% of private fusion companies aiming to deliver a fusion prototype device during the 2030s, according to the Fusion Industry Association, this represents a key emerging supply chain for fusion nuclear power. Research contract and Term Sheet for HALEU Production Facility in South Africa with TerraPower. During 2Q 2024 we entered into a research contract with TerraPower, a nuclear innovation company and advanced nuclear energy developer, for the development of nuclear fuels that are expected to be used in next generation nuclear reactors. The contract's $2 million value will be paid to ASP Isotopes in instalments over the course of the research project, subject to the completion of certain deliverables and milestones. The Company invoiced TerraPower for the first instalment during 4Q 2024. We believe that this research collaboration between a U.S. enrichment company and a U.S. nuclear reactor company for the development of enrichment processes for nuclear fuel is the first of its kind. In our view, this validates that ASP Isotopes scientists have developed some of the world\u2019s most advanced isotope enrichment technologies. During 4Q 2024, the Company entered into a non-binding term sheet with TerraPower related to the construction of a uranium enrichment facility capable of producing High Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) and the future supply of HALEU to TerraPower, as a customer of Quantum Leap Energy LLC (QLE). The term sheet contemplates the preparation of definitive agreements pursuant to which TerraPower would provide funding for the construction of a HALEU production facility. In addition, the parties anticipate entering into a long-term supply agreement for the HALEU expected to be produced at this facility pursuant to which the customer would purchase all the HALEU produced at the facility over a 10-year period after the expected completion of the facility. It is anticipated that the definitive agreements will be assigned to ASP Isotopes\u2019 wholly owned subsidiary, QLE, which the Company hopes to spin out as a separate entity in the future. During the next 30 years, global energy consumption will likely double ( 5 ) . To meet 2050 climate goals, set by many governments and organizations, this must occur with a zero increase in carbon emissions. The advanced nuclear fuels required during the next 50 years are expected to differ significantly from those used in the last 50 years. Specifically, many small modular and advanced reactors in the future are expected to require HALEU ( 6) . The Company believes that its enrichment technologies can be deployed in a new HALEU facility for considerably lower capital costs, and in much less time, compared to the construction of an enrichment facility using a traditional centrifuge process of HALEU production. MOU with Necsa (South African Nuclear Engineering Corporation) to develop an advanced nuclear fuel production facility at Pelindaba, South Africa. In November, I was honored to attend a signing ceremony at Pelindaba for a Memorandum of Understanding (\u201cMOU\u201d) between ASP Isotopes and the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation (Necsa) to collaborate on the research, development and construction of an Advanced Nuclear Fuel production facility. Necsa is a state-owned company established by the Republic of South Africa Nuclear Energy Act in 1999 with a mandate to undertake and promote research and development in the field of nuclear energy and radiation sciences. Necsa is also responsible for processing source material, and co-operating with other institutions on nuclear and related matters. The MOU was executed at a signing ceremony that took place at Pelindaba on November 14, 2024. As chairman and CEO of ASP Isotopes, I signed on behalf of ASP Isotopes and Mr Loyiso Tyabashe, Group CEO of Necsa, signed on behalf of Necsa. The signing ceremony was attended by representatives of the South African Government and included the participation of Minister Kgosientsho Ramokgopa, South Africa\u2019s newly appointed Minister of Electricity and Energy. The proposed structure under discussion for the delivery of the objectives of the MOU contemplates the formation of a new entity in South Africa with a board of directors consisting of at least two representatives from each of ASP Isotopes and Necsa. Discussions between the parties during the last three years have focused on advancing new nuclear fuel for small modular reactors and advanced nuclear reactors and eventually the construction of a nuclear fuel facility for the production of HALEU. The Company is happy to share with investors that scientists from ASP Isotopes have already been active at Pelindaba and the construction of the first of two HALEU test facilities has been completed. We anticipate that we will complete the construction of the second test facility during 2025 and this will pave the way to start comprehensive testing of our technologies on the production of HALEU. This partnership with Necsa will enable the Company to accelerate the construction of an advanced nuclear fuel facility. The proposed partnership with Necsa will likely help establish South Africa as a leader in Nuclear Engineering, producing the advanced nuclear fuels that the world requires to help prevent climate change. It will also mobilize hundreds of workers in local regions to build and operate the new manufacturing plant and support thousands of direct and indirect jobs across a nationwide manufacturing supply chain. The global isotopes market is at an inflection point, both in terms of demand and supply. ASP Isotopes and QLE are well positioned as trusted suppliers of both existing and future isotope products. Isotopes have one of the most severely compromised supply chains of any material in the world. Currently, supply is almost entirely controlled by Rosatom State Nuclear Energy Corporation, the Russian state-owned entity, and a few state-owned or controlled enrichers. The US Department of Energy (DOE) and every other major government in the Western World considers isotopes to be critical materials. Isotopes enable everyday activities such as nuclear imaging; they are also essential in the production of advanced electronics and semiconductors. Importantly, they serve as fuels and coolants in nuclear power stations which provide approximately 18% of the total US electricity supply. Global industrial production, electricity generation and Western defense capabilities remain vulnerable to supply chain disruption by geopolitically hostile counterparties. This explains the active interest we receive from a number of companies and governments regarding our longer-term supply capabilities, and we hope to sign additional supply agreements for essential isotopes in the coming months. ASP Isotopes Investor Access Event in South Africa in January 2025 \u2013 already fully booked ASP Isotopes values transparency and open communication with all stakeholders and counterparties. During 2024, the Company welcomed over 60 investors and corporate clients to its facilities in South Africa. The Company recently announced that it will host an Investor Access Event in South Africa from January 14-16, 2025. I would like to take this opportunity to extend my gratitude to all our shareholders and employees at ASP Isotopes. When we started the Company approximately three years ago we had a headcount of just two individuals. We now have a team of over 130 highly skilled and motivated employees across 3 continents, all of whom are highly motivated to innovate new technologies that can help solve some of today\u2019s most pressing challenges such as advanced computing, global warming, and cutting-edge healthcare solutions. It has clearly been a busy year for the Company, and in hitting such an impressive list of milestones, our scientists and engineers have done an amazing job. I\u2019m proud of our entire team, for the work done to date and for the work I expect we will together continue to do going forward. Thank you for your dedication and hard work.

ASP is an advanced materials company dedicated to developing technology and processes to produce isotopes in multiple industries. The Company employs proprietary technology, the Aerodynamic Separation Process (\u201cASP technology\u201d), for the production, distribution, marketing, and sale of all isotopes. The Company\u2019s initial focus is on producing and commercializing highly enriched isotopes for the healthcare and technology industries. With time, it also plans to enrich isotopes for the green energy sector. The Company has two isotope enrichment facilities in Pretoria, South Africa. The first is a facility dedicated to the enrichment of isotopes of elements with a low atomic mass (light isotopes) and will initially produce Carbon-14. The ASP plans to use the second, larger facility for the production of multiple different isotopes. There is a growing demand for isotopes such as Silicon-28, which will enable quantum computing, and Molybdenum-100, Molybdenum-98, Zinc-68, Ytterbium-176, and Nickel-64 for new, emerging healthcare applications, as well as Chlorine-37, Lithium-6, and Uranium-235 for green energy applications. The ASP Technology (Aerodynamic Separation Process) is ideal for enriching low and heavy atomic mass molecules. For more information, please visit www.aspisotopes.com .

Responds To Short Seller \u201cReport\u201d ASP Isotopes Inc. Fri, Dec 13, 2024, 4:00 PM 15 min de lectura En este art\u00edculo: ASPI ASP Isotopes Inc. WASHINGTON, Dec. 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ASP Isotopes Inc. NASDAQ: ASPI (\u201cASP Isotopes\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), an advanced materials company dedicated to the development of technology and processes for the production of isotopes for use in multiple industries, today issued the following statement in response to short seller Fuzzy Panda\u2019s purported \u201creport\u201d published on November 26, 2024. Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Paul Mann, stated: \u201c Fuzzy Panda is known for these types of short attacks, which are designed to allow short sellers to profit from a declined stock price. Tellingly, as the so-called \u201cresearch report\u201d states in its \u201cdisclaimer,\u201d Fuzzy Panda and affiliates are short the Company\u2019s stock and \u201ctherefore stand to realize significant gains in the event\u201d the Company\u2019s stock price declines, while also disclaiming that \u201cthe information it has relied upon\u201d may be inaccurate. The Company\u2019s management believes this short seller\u2019s report contains incomplete and inaccurate information, distortions of facts, flawed analyses, and misleading conclusions. By way of one of many examples, Fuzzy Panda purports to summarize the Company\u2019s \u201ckey technology,\u201d but omits any mention of the Company\u2019s aerodynamic separation process technology, which is currently deployed at the Company\u2019s Silicon-28 and Carbon-14 enrichment facilities in Pretoria, South Africa. In addition, we believe Fuzzy Panda\u2019s criticisms of the Company\u2019s laser-based quantum enrichment technology is based upon a comparison to outdated AVLIS technology from the 1990s, which we view to be, at best, misleading. The Company announced recently that it had demonstrated proof of concept using quantum enrichment technology to enrich Ytterbium-176. Once further refinement has been completed, the Company expects to supply enriched Ytterbium-176 to customers from a facility being commissioned in Pretoria, South Africa (anticipated during the course of 2025). Following the signing of an agreement with NECSA (Nuclear Energy Corporation of South Africa) we plan to apply quantum enrichment technology to the enrichment of uranium at Pelindaba in Pretoria, South Africa. We believe the Company\u2019s significant progress in these and other respects is a more reliable indicator of the Company\u2019s prospects than the \u201cinferences and deductions\u201d upon which Fuzzy Panda\u2019s report is based. ASP Isotopes is exploring its options in response to this attack while continuing to focus on our business, growing revenues and executing on our strategic plan. \u201d The Company provides this statement to address certain areas of confusion among investors and customers arising from the Fuzzy Panda report and does not purport to respond to all of Fuzzy Panda\u2019s assertions. Leer m\u00e1s The Company\u2019s Quantum Enrichment Technology and ASP Technology Fuzzy Panda states that \u201cASPI Tech is Failed 1990s Tech,\u201d claiming \u201cthis is the key technology ASPI is hyping.\u201d In support, Fuzzy Panda asserts that the Company uses outdated AVLIS laser enrichment technology to enrich its isotopes. The Company\u2019s quantum enrichment technology is substantially different from AVLIS, a laser enrichment technique that has been experimented with over the past 40 years. Key differences between the Company\u2019s quantum enrichment technology and AVLIS include a more advanced spectroscopy, different lasers and more advanced beam shaping. The Company is developing quantum enrichment technology to produce enriched Ytterbium-176 (\u201cYb-176\u201d), Nickel-64, Lithium\u00a06, Lithium-7 and Uranium-235 (\u201cU-235\u201d). The construction of the Company\u2019s first quantum enrichment facility was completed in August 2024, and the Company produced the first semi-finished material of enriched Yb-176 during the commissioning phase of the plant in October 2024. The Company expects to be able to achieve a 99.75% enrichment for Yb-176 and offer highly enriched Yb-176 for commercial sale during 2025. Appendix B of the Fuzzy Panda \u201creport\u201d includes some basic laser mathematics, suggesting that the lasers that the Company will be using in its quantum enrichment technology as applied to the enrichment of uranium are not powerful enough. First, assuming the Company did intend to use this technology (AVLIS), the analysis in Appendix B is wrong because the excitation of an atom is driven by the difference in energies of a number of photons applied in series, not a single difference in energy. Second, the author of the report has incorrectly deduced that the lasers the Company is currently using for Ytterbium enrichment will also be used for uranium enrichment and will therefore not be capable of supplying enough power. During quantum enrichment, different metals require different combinations of wavelengths, different photon energies, and different beam shapes. Therefore, the laser system for each isotope will be different and specific for that isotope. Wavelengths of light, the photon energies and the beam shaping characteristics for any isotope is highly confidential and proprietary. We believe that Fuzzy Panda\u2019s analysis is based upon erroneous assumptions and, accordingly, results in false or misleading characterizations of the Company\u2019s enrichment technology. We believe Fuzzy Panda\u2019s conclusions and characterizations of ASP Isotopes\u2019 technology are also misleading by omission. For example, the Company\u2019s aerodynamic separation process technology (\u201cASP technology\u201d) is designed to enable the production of isotopes used in several industries and is currently deployed in enrichment facilities in South Africa for Carbon-14 and Silicon-28. Notably, the Company\u2019s ASP technology is not even mentioned in the report. Initiative to Commence Uranium Enrichment in South Africa In October 2024, we entered into a term sheet with TerraPower, LLC related to the construction of a uranium enrichment facility capable of producing HALEU and the future supply of HALEU to TerraPower. Fuzzy Panda claims that the term sheet \u201ccame at Zero Cost to TerraPower,\u201d which is factually incorrect because ASP Isotopes has already invoiced TerraPower following the signing of the term sheet with TerraPower. Fuzzy Panda describes the term sheet as \u201c likely Non-Binding\u201d as if that fact were hidden, when in reality the Company had previously publicly disclosed in its SEC filings that, with certain exceptions, \u201cthe term sheet is non-binding and there is no assurance that the parties will enter into definitive agreements.\u201d The Company nonetheless believes the term sheet with TerraPower is valuable because it represents the first step towards a two-fold definitive agreement with TerraPower. The term sheet with TerraPower contemplates the parties entering into a definitive agreement, pursuant to which TerraPower would provide funding for the construction of a HALEU production facility. In addition, the parties anticipate entering into a long-term supply agreement for HALEU expected to be produced at this facility, pursuant to which the customer would purchase all HALEU produced at the facility over a 10-year period after the expected completion of the facility in 2027. The term sheet with TerraPower preceded the signing in November 2024 of a memorandum of understanding (\u201cMOU\u201d) with The South African Nuclear Energy Corporation (Necsa) to collaborate on the research, development and ultimately the commercial production of advanced nuclear fuels. The proposed structure under discussion for the delivery of the objectives of the MOU contemplates the formation of a new entity in South Africa with a board of directors consisting of at least two representatives from ASPI and Necsa. Subject to the receipt of all required permits and licenses to begin enrichment of U-235 in South Africa, it is anticipated that the research, development and ultimate construction of a HALEU production facility will take place at Pelindaba in Pretoria, South Africa\u2019s main nuclear research center and the home of the 20MW research nuclear reactor, SAFARI-1. Finally, the Report states that, according to an unidentified \u201cformer\u201d TerraPower executive, TerraPower rates ASPI \u201cat the bottom in terms of quality.\u201d In TerraPower\u2019s public announcement regarding the term sheet, a current TerraPower executive, Chris Levesque, TerraPower President and CEO, was quoted as saying, \u201c We are optimistic about ASP Isotopes\u2019 enrichment capabilities and planned timeline to help ensure advanced nuclear energy can achieve its necessary role in meeting climate energy targets. \u201d Regulatory Approvals Required for Enrichment of Uranium One of Fuzzy Panda\u2019s headlines claims that ASP Isotopes lacks a license to enrich uranium from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and that the licensing process could take 10-15 years. As described herein, the Company\u2019s strategy involves the formation of a new entity in South Africa with The South African Nuclear Energy Corporation (Necsa) to undertake the research, development and ultimate construction of a HALEU production facility at Pelindaba in Pretoria, South Africa\u2019s main nuclear research center. Necsa is a state-owned company established by the Republic of South Africa Nuclear Energy Act in 1999 with a mandate to undertake and promote research and development in the field of nuclear energy and radiation sciences. The NRC would not be the licensing authority for a uranium enrichment facility in South Africa. Therefore, the Company would not need to apply for an NRC license in the United States for such a facility operated by a South African affiliate of the Company. The South Africa nuclear regulatory licensing regime will apply to the Company\u2019s uranium enrichment activities, and the Company will apply for all required permits and licenses to enrich U-235 in South Africa. Intellectual Property Fuzzy Panda\u2019s report criticizes the Company because it currently has no patents. Enrichment is among the most sensitive nuclear technologies because it can produce weapons-grade materials. To the extent the Company\u2019s technology developed for the purposes of producing enriched isotopes for use in nuclear medicine or concentrating uranium in the isotope uranium-235 for use in nuclear energy can be applied to the creation or development of weapons-grade materials, then that technology would be highly controlled and subject to limitations on public disclosure or export. Accordingly, patent protection in the United States for such sensitive nuclear technology developed in South Africa would be, in the view of the Company\u2019s management, unusual, if even possible. As noted in the Company\u2019s SEC filings, the Company has relied exclusively on trade secrets and other intellectual property laws, non-disclosure agreements with our respective employees, consultants, vendors, potential customers and other relevant persons and other measures to protect our intellectual property, and intends to continue to rely on these and other means. While pursuing patents remains part of the Company\u2019s intellectual property protection philosophy and strategy, the advisability of establishing provisional patent rights is continuously assessed on a case-by-case basis in respect of both conceptual aspects and the specific applications thereof. Such assessments are made in consultation with regulatory bodies and with due consideration to the prospects of successfully obtaining patent protection in light of any disclosure constraints that are imposed by such bodies. To date, the Company has not determined that patent protection is appropriate or viable in light of these considerations. PET Labs Financial Track Record Fuzzy Panda also incorrectly asserts that PET Labs has annual losses of ~$19.5 - 20 million a year. PET Labs has generated positive EBITDA for the last several years. Fuzzy Panda also incorrectly claims that at the time PET Labs was acquired by the Company (in 4Q 2023) the $2\u00a0million paid for the acquisition was likely made to a related party, which is incorrect. At the time of the acquisition, the CEO and owner of PET Labs was not a related party. The Company\u2019s U.S. Offices Fuzzy Panda criticizes that ASP Isotopes\u2019 headquarters in the United States was once a virtual office and then a co-working space. ASP\u00a0Isotopes has had since its inception a minimal physical presence in the United States because it has relied upon external consultants and professional advisors and currently permits remote work arrangements for a limited number of recent hires in the United States. ASP\u00a0Isotopes has not entered into any lease agreement for executive offices in the United States. The Company\u2019s South African Enrichment Facilities Fuzzy Panda states that the \u201cprimary location\u201d of the Company\u2019s South African subsidiaries is \u201c1\u00a0Melrose Blvd- Unit 19, Johannesburg, South Africa,\u201d but \u201cASP Isotopes\u2019s SA subsidiaries were NOT actually there.\u201d The cited address is that of the Company\u2019s South African subsidiaries utilized for correspondence, and of Jaltech Pty Ltd, which has been engaged by ASP Isotopes South Africa (Pty) Ltd to provide certain corporate advisory operations for the Company\u2019s South African subsidiaries, including local accounting, tax and payroll services. It is not the address of the Company\u2019s core business operations. The Company\u2019s core business operations are located in South Africa (as specified below) where, as of November\u00a030, 2024, there are approximately 126 employees, including 26 employees in Research and Development, 50 employees are in construction and manufacturing and 14 employees in general management. The Company is currently in the process of commissioning three isotope enrichment facilities in South Africa. The \u201cmulti-isotope\u201d facility, located at 33 Eland Street, Koedoespoort Industrial, Pretoria, has its initial production run designated for enriched Silicon-28. The facility located at Building 29, CSIR Campus, Meiring Naude Road, Brummeria, Pretoria is scheduled to enrich Carbon-14 for use in healthcare and agrochemicals. The facility located at Building 46, CSIR Campus, Meiring Naude Road, Brummeria, Pretoria is scheduled to enrich Ytterbium-176, a critically important raw material for use in the production of radio-oncology therapies. The Company has hosted a group of significant investors and several commercial partners at its facilities in South Africa as recently as November, 2024. ASP Isotopes Inc. Stockholder Base One of Fuzzy Panda\u2019s headlines claims that ASP Isotopes has ties to \u201cmicrocap fraudsters\u201d who are \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d or \u201chiding\u201d in the capital structure. The basic premise is that among the Company\u2019s numerous pre-IPO investors are entities affiliated with family members of individuals who have been subject to SEC charges for violations of securities laws or entities formerly affiliated with such individuals. None of the individuals named in the report or their family members has ever been an officer, director or employee of the Company. The Company regards each of its pre-IPO investors who are not directors or executive officers as passive investors who do not, and have never had, any control or influence over management of the Company. Barry Honig, John Stetson, Jonathan Honig and Titan Multi-Strategy Fund I, Ltd have no role in the management of the Company and Fuzzy Panda\u2019s referencing securities enforcement matters concerning them glosses over that those matters did not involve ASP Isotopes. As of December\u00a011, 2024, the Company\u2019s stockholder base is comprised of approximately 31% institutional and other reputable investors introduced to the Company by leading investment banks and placement agents. As previously stated in our press release dated December 2, 2024, we value transparency and open communication. We look forward to hosting as many investors as possible at our Investor Access Event in South Africa from January 14-16, 2025. Should you be interested in attending, please email Viktor Petkov at vpetkov@aspisotopes.com as soon as possible to complete the registration process. ASP Isotopes remains focused on our business and growing revenues, and executing on our strategic plan. We look forward to continuing to drive positive momentum in 2025. The Company believes this short seller\u2019s report is an attempt to profit from a deliberately false picture of our Company, and we encourage our stockholders, customers, counterparties and stakeholders to look past the factual errors, misrepresentations, mischaracterizations and misleading claims.

Wed, Dec 18, 2024, 3:57 PM 6 min read In This Article: ASPI ECL The chemical industry bore the brunt of a demand slowdown in certain major markets, including consumer durables and building & construction, and an unprecedented customer inventory de-stocking that weighed on the industry through the first half of 2024. Lower consumer spending due to inflationary pressures in Europe and a slow recovery in China have impacted demand this year. The economic slowdown in China, geopolitical tensions and inflation weighed on global manufacturing activities. While the de-stocking has run its course, the industry remains mired in demand headwinds. Amid the challenges, certain companies in this space have managed to stand out with impressive performances in 2024. These include Ecolab Inc. ECL, ASP Isotopes Inc. ASPI and Perimeter Solutions, Inc. PRM. Green Shoots of Recovery Following a Tough Year The chemical space has grappled with weaker demand this year. The downturn in the building & construction market and the de-stocking in consumer electronics have played spoilsport, leading to demand destruction in these key markets. In North America, uncertainties surrounding the U.S. housing market have weighed on building & construction. Elevated borrowing costs and inflation have taken a bite out of the residential construction industry. Housing starts have declined while home prices have remained under pressure in 2024. Manufacturing activities have also softened amid weaker demand for goods and higher borrowing costs, while recovery remains tepid. Demand for chemicals in the industrial sector has weakened as muted demand has constrained industrial production in the United States. The automotive industry, traditionally a significant consumer of chemicals like plastics, adhesives, and coatings, has experienced a mixed year in 2024. While the shift toward electric vehicles has created pockets of demand, overall vehicle production was constrained by high input costs and economic uncertainty. In packaging, inflationary pressures constrained discretionary consumer spending, impacting the sector. The consumer electronics market, a key driver of demand for specialty chemicals and advanced materials, was among the hardest hit. Aggressive inventory de-stocking by manufacturers, combined with lower sales of devices such as smartphones and personal computers, has led to a significant contraction in chemical demand. Following the post-pandemic boom, global electronics demand cooled amid high inflation, elevated interest rates and cautious consumer behavior. A slower recovery in economic activities in China, a major consumer of chemicals, has hurt demand in that country. China has grappled with weakening industrial production and sluggish consumer spending. The slowdown in the real estate sector further suppressed demand for construction chemicals. The slowdown in Europe, resulting from the war in Ukraine and weaker consumer spending due to high levels of inflation, has led to softer demand in that region. Energy and feedstock inflation resulted in reduced industrial production and consumer spending in Europe. The demand slowdown in industrial and consumer durables hurt volumes of chemical companies in 2024, in particular, during the first half. Weak demand in the United States and abroad led to a decline in the production of both basic and specialty chemicals. On a positive note, customer de-stocking has ended, leading to low inventory levels. This is expected to lead to an uptick in chemical demand and volumes in 2025. The de-stocking was primarily driven by high inflation and the lingering impacts of the pandemic that affected customer spending. The chemical industry is expected to see a recovery next year as inflation eases, borrowing costs decline, consumption improves and demand rebounds across key markets. With easing inflation and stabilization of interest rates, industrial production across North America and Europe is likely to improve, supporting chemical demand in manufacturing-intensive sectors. Meanwhile, chemical companies continue to take a host of strategic measures, including cost-cutting and productivity improvement, operational efficiency improvement and actions to strengthen the balance sheet and boost cash flows amid a challenging environment. In particular, the industry participants are aggressively implementing actions to bring down costs. They are also raising selling prices to counter inflation. Such moves are likely to help the industry sustain margins amid the prevailing challenges. A decline in raw material and energy costs driven by the easing of supply-chain disruptions also augurs well for the chemical industry heading into 2025.
