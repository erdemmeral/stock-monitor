1:10 AM 3 min read In This Article: ZVRA -2.42% Assertio (ASRT) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.03 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.05. This compares to earnings of $0.01 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 40%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this drugmaker would post a loss of $0.02 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.04, delivering a surprise of -100%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. Assertio , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Drugs industry, posted revenues of $29.2 million for the quarter ended September 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.29%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $35.63 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Assertio shares have lost about 20.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 25.7%. What's Next for Assertio? While Assertio has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Assertio: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Same-day dosing results comparable to next day dosing schedules LAKE FOREST, Ill., Dec. 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Assertio Holdings, Inc. (\u201cAssertio\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (Nasdaq: ASRT), a pharmaceutical company with comprehensive commercial capabilities offering differentiated products to patients, announced yesterday results of a clinical trial investigating the utility of Rolvedon \u00ae (eflapegrastim-xnst) injection when dosed the same day of chemotherapy for patients with early stage breast cancer (ESBC). The results were presented as part of the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium by the American Association of Cancer Research and the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. In this open-label, single-arm study (NCT04187898), conducted across 13 sites in the US, individuals received Rolvedon 30 minutes post chemotherapy for ESBC. Rolvedon demonstrated 1.8 days to neutrophil count recovery and a febrile neutropenia rate of 2%. Zero patients required the need for hospitalization and/or intervention for febrile neutropenia. No new safety signals were identified. \"We are pleased with the expected, positive results from the Rolvedon same day dosing trial and the evidence supporting our belief that Rolvedon can make a meaningful difference for patients undergoing chemotherapy. This milestone further underscores our commitment to improving the lives of patients undergoing cancer treatment by providing convenient and effective treatment options,\" said\u00a0Brendan O\u2019Grady, CEO of Assertio Therapeutics. \"The excellent safety and efficacy profile of Rolvedon in this trial is very encouraging, providing clinical data indicating that same day dosing outcomes are safe and effective for this unique molecule,\" said\u00a0Dr. Howard Franklin, SVP of Medical of Assertio Therapeutics. \"Our goal is to enhance patient outcomes and quality of life (QoL), and these results support the potential of Rolvedon to do just that.\u201d Details of the study and poster presentation can be found at the SABCS website, https://sabcs.org/ .

Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 12:02 AM 24 min read In This Article: ASRT +0.92% Assertio Holdings, Inc. Third Quarter Total Net Product Sales of $28.7 Million Rolvedon Net Product Sales of $15.0 Million Cash and Short-Term Investments of $88.6 Million LAKE FOREST, Ill., Nov. 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Assertio Holdings, Inc. (\u201cAssertio\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (Nasdaq: ASRT), a pharmaceutical company with comprehensive commercial capabilities offering differentiated products to patients, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September\u00a030, 2024. \u201cThird quarter results reflected solid performance as we continue to establish Rolvedon as our lead asset and drive economic returns from our commercial portfolio,\u201d said Brendan O\u2019Grady, Chief Executive Officer. \u201cRolvedon has been well received by physicians, posting another quarter of stable performance and the continued expansion of our customer base. The Rolvedon same day dosing trial has concluded and the results have been accepted for presentation at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December 2024.\u201d \u201cAdditionally, we have implemented new sales and marketing tactics for Sympazan, which are designed to drive prescriber awareness and prescription growth in key markets. We are maintaining our share of Indocin and working to maximize the value of this product and our other commercial assets moving forward. We are also evaluating new approaches to grow existing assets as well as the acquisition of additional assets to fuel further growth.\u201d Financial Highlights (unaudited): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended (in millions, except per share amounts) September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net Product Sales (GAAP) $ 28.7 $ 30.7 $ 35.1 $ 91.3 $ 117.0 Net Loss (GAAP) $ (2.9 ) $ (3.7 ) $ (279.5 ) $ (11.1 ) $ (274.6 ) Loss Per Share (GAAP) $ (0.03 ) $ (0.04 ) $ (3.42 ) $ (0.12 ) $ (4.35 ) Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) 1 $ 5.3 $ 5.0 $ 12.9 $ 17.7 $ 63.3 Adjusted Earnings Per Share (Non-GAAP) 1 $ 0.03 $ 0.02 $ 0.01 $ 0.09 $ 0.46 Third quarter results included the following highlights (our discussion below focuses on a comparison of third quarter 2024 to second quarter 2024 given the acquisition of Spectrum and the generic competition of Indocin introduced in the third quarter 2023): Rolvedon net product sales were stable at $15.0 million in the third quarter, from $15.1 million in the second quarter, driven by continued volume growth offset by lower net pricing. Indocin net product sales in the third quarter were $5.7 million, decreased from $6.9 million in the second quarter, due to the previously announced generic competition affecting pricing. Gross margin 2 in the third quarter increased to 74%, from 71% in the second quarter, primarily due a decrease in the level of inventory write downs in late life-cycle stage products and the completion of Rolvedon inventory step-up amortization. SG&A expense in the third quarter was $16.7 million, decreased from $18.4 million in the second quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales and marketing and other general and administrative costs, partially offset by net higher legal related charges. Adjusted EBITDA 3 was $5.3 million in the third quarter, increased from $5.0 million in the second quarter, primarily due to lower SG&A expense, partially offset by lower net product sales. Story Continues Balance Sheet and Cash Flow For the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $88.6\u00a0million, compared with $88.4 million at June 30, 2024. Cash flow generation during the quarter was impacted by the timing of working capital as well as lower net product sales. Debt at September\u00a030, 2024 was $40.0 million, comprised of the Company\u2019s 6.5% convertible notes, with no maturities until September 2027. Board Updates Peter Staple retired from the board after more than 20 years as an independent director. Also, Dr. Jeffrey Vacirca has elected to depart from the board to focus on his other business interests. Both departures were effective November 7, 2024. Assertio announced the appointment of Heather Mason as Board Chair. Mason has served as an independent director since 2019 and as interim CEO of Assertio from January to May of 2024. Further, David Stark was appointed to the board as an independent director and member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Stark was previously Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer at Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited. \u201cI want thank Jeff and Peter for their service to Assertio and its shareholders,\u201d said Mason. \u201cJeff\u2019s insight into the oncology market since joining the board as part of the Spectrum transaction has been invaluable. Peter has served for more than 20 years on the Assertio board, offering calm leadership and wise counsel through transitions and challenges faced by the organization during his tenure. I also appreciate Peter extending his board service during the time of transition to Brendan O\u2019Grady as the new CEO. I want to welcome David to the board and look forward to his partnership. David brings extensive litigation, compliance and acquisition experience from his time at Teva and earlier in private law firm practice.\u201d Conference Call and Investor Presentation Information Assertio\u2019s management will host a conference call to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results today: Date: Monday, November 11, 2024 Time: 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time Webcast (live and archive): http://investor.assertiotx.com/overview/default.aspx (Events & Webcasts, Investor Page) Dial-in numbers: 1-646-307-1963, Conference ID 3278948 To access the live webcast, the recorded conference call replay, and other materials, please visit Assertio\u2019s investor relations website at http://investor.assertiotx.com/overview/default.aspx .

These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements, including: Assertio\u2019s ability to grow sales of, and the commercial success and market acceptance of, Rolvedon and Assertio\u2019s other products; Assertio\u2019s ability to successfully develop and execute its sales, marketing and promotion strategies using its sales force and non-personal promotion model capabilities; the impact on sales and profits from the entry and sales of generics of Assertio\u2019s products and/or other products competitive with any of Assertio\u2019s products (including indomethacin suppositories compounded by hospitals and other institutions including a 503B compounder which we believe to be violation of certain provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act); the timing and impact of additional generic approvals and uncertainty around the recent approvals and launches of generic Indocin products (which are not patent protected and now face generic competition as a result of the August 2023 approval and launch of generic indomethacin suppositories and January 2024 approval and subsequent launch of a generic indomethacin oral suspension product); risks that any new businesses will not be integrated successfully or that the combined company will not realize estimated cost savings, value of certain tax assets, synergies and growth, or that such benefits may take longer and/or cost more to realize than expected; expected industry trends, including pricing pressures and managed healthcare practices; Assertio\u2019s ability to attract and retain executive leadership and key employees; the ability of Assertio\u2019s third-party manufacturers to manufacture adequate quantities of commercially salable inventory and active pharmaceutical ingredients for each of Assertio\u2019s products on commercially reasonable terms and in compliance with their contractual obligations to Assertio, and Assertio\u2019s ability to maintain its supply chain which relies on single-source suppliers; the outcome of, and Assertio\u2019s intentions with respect to, any litigation or government investigations, including pending and potential future shareholder litigation relating to the Spectrum Merger and/or the recent approval and launch of generic indomethacin suppositories, opioid-related government investigations and opioid-related litigation, the recently unsealed qui tam litigation, as well as Spectrum\u2019s legacy shareholder and other litigation and, and other disputes and litigation, and the costs and expenses associated therewith; Assertio\u2019s financial cost and outcomes of clinical trials, including the extent to which data from the Rolvedon same-day dosing trial may support ongoing commercialization efforts; Assertio\u2019s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements related to the development or promotion of its products; variations in revenues obtained from commercialization agreements and the accounting treatment with respect thereto; Assertio\u2019s common stock maintaining compliance with The Nasdaq Capital Market\u2019s minimum closing bid requirement of at least $1.00 per share, particularly in light of Assertio\u2019s stock trading below or only slightly above $1.00 per share recently as well as recent market activity by a short seller; and Assertio\u2019s ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for its products and operate its business without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. For a discussion of additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by forward-looking statements, see the risks described in Assertio\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Many of these risks and uncertainties may be exacerbated by public health emergencies and general macroeconomic conditions. Assertio does not assume, and hereby disclaims, any obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as may be required by law. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement the Company\u2019s financial results presented on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) basis, the Company has included information about non-GAAP measures of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings, and adjusted earnings per share as useful operating metrics. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed with results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliation, provides supplementary information to analysts, investors, lenders, and the Company\u2019s management in assessing the Company\u2019s performance and results from period to period. The Company uses these non-GAAP measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate the Company\u2019s performance, and in part, in the determination of bonuses for executive officers and employees. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, net income or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures used by us may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

(2) Debt-related expenses consist of an induced conversion expense of approximately $8.8\u00a0million and direct transaction costs of approximately $1.1\u00a0million incurred as a result of the privately negotiated exchange of $30.0 million principal amount of the Company\u2019s 6.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 in the first quarter of 2023. (3) Represents transaction-related expenses associated with the acquisition of Spectrum, which closed effective July 31, 2023.

(2) The Company uses the if-converted method with respect to its convertible debt to compute GAAP and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when the effect is dilutive. Under the if-converted method, the Company assumes the 2027 Convertible Notes were converted at the beginning of each period presented and outstanding. As a result, interest expense, net of tax, and any other income statement impact associated with the 2027 Convertible Notes, net of tax, is added back to net income used in the diluted earnings per share calculation. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, the Company\u2019s potentially dilutive convertible debt under the if-converted method and stock-based awards under the treasury-stock method were not included in the computation of GAAP net loss and diluted net loss per share, and the potentially dilutive convertible debt under the if-converted method were not included in non-GAAP adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share, because to do so would be anti-dilutive. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company\u2019s potentially dilutive convertible debt under the if-converted method was not included in the computation of both non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share and GAAP diluted net loss per share, because to do so would be anti-dilutive. However, the potentially dilutive stock-based awards under the treasury-stock method were included in the computation of non-GAAP adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share because the effect was dilutive. (3) Represents the accrued cash payable, if any, of the INDOCIN contingent consideration for the respective period based on 20% royalty for annual INDOCIN net sales over $20.0 million. (4) Represents the charge in the period for the impairment of intangible assets resulting from the revaluation of the Company\u2019s long-lived assets. (5) Represents the amount of income tax expense related to the recognition of a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in the period. (6) Represents the Company\u2019s income tax expense adjustment from the tax effect of pre-tax adjustments excluded from adjusted earnings. The tax effect of pre-tax adjustments excluded from adjusted earnings is computed at the blended federal and state statutory rate of 25%.

(2) The Company uses the if-converted method with respect to its convertible debt to compute GAAP and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when the effect is dilutive. Under the if-converted method, the Company assumes the 2027 Convertible Notes were converted at the beginning of each period presented and outstanding. As a result, interest expense, net of tax, and any other income statement impact associated with the 2027 Convertible Notes, net of tax, is added back to net income used in the diluted earnings per share calculation. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company\u2019s potentially dilutive convertible debt under the if-converted method and stock-based awards under the treasury-stock method were not included in the computation of GAAP net loss and diluted net loss per share, and the potentially dilutive convertible debt under the if-converted method were not included in non-GAAP adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share, because to do so would be anti-dilutive. However, the potentially dilutive stock-based awards under the treasury-stock method were included in the computation of non-GAAP adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share because the effect was dilutive. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company\u2019s potentially dilutive convertible debt under the if-converted method and stock-based awards under the treasury-stock method were not included in the computation of GAAP diluted net income per share, because to do so would be anti-dilutive. However, the potentially dilutive convertible debt under the if-converted method and stock-based awards under the treasury-stock method were included in the computation of non-GAAP adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share because the effect was dilutive.

(5) Represents the amount of income tax expense related to the recognition of a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in the period. (6) Represents the Company\u2019s income tax expense adjustment from the tax effect of pre-tax adjustments excluded from adjusted earnings. The tax effect of pre-tax adjustments excluded from adjusted earnings is computed at the blended federal and state statutory rate of 25%.

of Product-Related Fraud at Assertio Business Wire Mon, Nov 11, 2024, 11:41 PM 7 min read Evidence Corroborates Allegations of Multiple Former Executives Calls on Assertio Board to Release Full Investigation Report and Supporting Materials NEW YORK, November 11, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--The Buxton Helmsley Group, Inc. (together with certain of its affiliates, \"BHG\" or \"we\"), a New York City-based investment fund manager that has inverted its long equity position into that of a short interest in the publicly traded securities of Assertio Holdings, Inc. (\"Assertio\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: ASRT), today responded to the Company\u2019s attempt to deny, in its November 11, 2024, press release, the evident product-related fraud at Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc., now wholly-owned by Assertio. \"The statement from Assertio this morning is a blanket response that, tellingly, does not even bother to rebut BHG\u2019s specific allegations\u2014it does not even deny the \u2018hush money\u2019 offers to whistleblowers. Instead, the Company is attempting to \u2018shoot the messenger\u2019 instead of addressing its failure to properly investigate these matters. Assertio apparently wishes to continue its evident product-related fraud that, as a byproduct, also appears to be defrauding Assertio investors. In defense of the validity of BHG\u2019s claims, we have released an initial set of evidence so that shareholders and regulators can judge for themselves where the truth lies,\" said Alexander Parker, Senior Managing Director of BHG. \"For example, within the evidence set we have released, shareholders will see a memo from Spectrum\u2019s former Executive Director of Clinical Operations to Spectrum\u2019s former SVP of Clinical Development and former SVP of Clinical Science about a request to delete adverse event data from Spectrum\u2019s database, which is fraudulent conduct. The pages from site audit reports reveal \u2018Major\u2019 discrepancies in clinical trial data and cite insufficient training for clinical trial staff. Although whistleblowers sent Assertio\u2019s leadership those site audit reports in private e-mails, Assertio is still issuing statements that say Spectrum\u2019s clinical trials were not \u2018Major[ly]\u2019 flawed across multiple products. The site audit reports tell the real story, and this is just one example of the full volume of material we will hand over to regulators. \"Given the misleading claims from Assertio to date, particularly the claim that the Company investigated the corroborating whistleblower allegations, we call on Mr. O\u2019Grady and the rest of Assertio\u2019s board of directors to release: (i) the full report of its investigation; (ii) documentation that it actually communicated with the whistleblowers; and (iii) documentation confirming it obtained materials from the whistleblowers. Shareholders will note that the investigation, if it ever occurred at all, never collected or reviewed the whistleblowers\u2019 supporting evidence \u2013 the Company did not even communicate with the whistleblowers in writing. BHG believes this raises substantial questions about the validity of the investigation\u2019s conclusions and the judgment of the board, which accepted the investigation report. Story Continues \"If the Assertio board\u2019s preferred path is to continue denying the fraud at Spectrum and the pathetically inadequate due diligence leading up to the Spectrum acquisition, we agree with Assertio that regulatory attention is warranted. For its part, BHG is already seeking to engage with the U.S. SEC about these matters, having filed a whistleblower complaint with the agency. The materials we are prepared to turn over include the evidence released to stockholders today, supplemented by vast additional material possessed by the Spectrum whistleblowers. \"The next step will be made by the Assertio board. If they wish to acknowledge reality and pivot to seek to cure the Company and the board\u2019s related liability, we will applaud their decision to reverse course and accept responsibility for past mistakes. If they continue to deny the validity of our evidence-backed assertions, we will continue taking steps to cast light on their considerable evident malfeasance,\" concluded Parker.
