[{"text": "Wall Street Analysts Believe Capricor (CAPR) Could Rally 208.09%: Here's is How to Trade Zacks Equity Research Thu, Jan 16, 2025, 5:55 PM 4 min read In This Article: CAPR Capricor Therapeutics (CAPR) closed the last trading session at $13.47, gaining 7.6% over the past four weeks, but there could be plenty of upside left in the stock if short-term price targets set by Wall Street analysts are any guide. The mean price target of $41.50 indicates a 208.1% upside potential. The mean estimate comprises six short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $18.52. While the lowest estimate of $25 indicates an 85.6% increase from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 471.6% to reach $77. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts. While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice. However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in CAPR. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside. Here's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price Targets According to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading. While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why? They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts. However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces. Story Continues That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism. Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in CAPR Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 8.2%, as one estimate has moved higher compared to no negative revision. Moreover, CAPR currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term.

2025, 1:49 PM 3 min read In This Article: CAPR Capricor Therapeutics, Inc. ( NASDAQ:CAPR ) shareholders might understandably be very concerned that the share price has dropped 34% in the last quarter. But that doesn't undermine the fantastic longer term performance (measured over five years). In that time, the share price has soared some 768% higher! Arguably, the recent fall is to be expected after such a strong rise. But the real question is whether the business fundamentals can improve over the long term. We love happy stories like this one. The company should be really proud of that performance! Since the stock has added US$67m to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns. See our latest analysis for Capricor Therapeutics Given that Capricor Therapeutics didn't make a profit in the last twelve months, we'll focus on revenue growth to form a quick view of its business development. Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. That's because fast revenue growth can be easily extrapolated to forecast profits, often of considerable size. In the last 5 years Capricor Therapeutics saw its revenue grow at 76% per year. Even measured against other revenue-focussed companies, that's a good result. Arguably, this is well and truly reflected in the strong share price gain of 54%(per year) over the same period. It's never too late to start following a top notch stock like Capricor Therapeutics, since some long term winners go on winning for decades. So we'd recommend you take a closer look at this one, but keep in mind the market seems optimistic. The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail). NasdaqCM:CAPR Earnings and Revenue Growth January 22nd 2025 We're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. This free report showing analyst forecasts should help you form a view on Capricor Therapeutics A Different Perspective It's nice to see that Capricor Therapeutics shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 240% over the last year. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 54%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Capricor Therapeutics better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Capricor Therapeutics (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that you should be aware of before investing here.

Updated Mineral Resource Estimate on Its Destiny Gold Project Newsfile Corp. Wed, Jan 8, 2025, 3:30 PM 9 min read In This Article: CAPR.CN Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - January 8, 2025) - Caprock Mining Corp. (CSE: CAPR) (\" Caprock \" or the \" Company \") is pleased to announce that it has engaged BBA E&C (\"BBA\"), a world-renowned resource consulting firm, to complete an updated Mineral Resource Estimate (\" MRE \") and accompanying National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\" NI 43-101 \") technical report (the \" Technical Report \") on its newly optioned Destiny gold property (\" Destiny \" or the \" Project \" or the \" Property \") located near Val D'Or, Quebec. The updated MRE is expected to be completed in Q1 2025, following which, the updated Technical Report is expected to be published in early Q2 2025. Destiny hosts a near-surface, historical NI 43-101 compliant MRE published in 2011 on the DAC deposit (the \" Historical Estimate \"), which is just one of several mineralized zones identified on the Property through previous drilling, comprising the following gold inventory: 10.8 million tonnes averaging 1.05 g/t Au and containing 364,000 ounces Au in the Indicated category; and 8.3 million tonnes averaging 0.92 g/t Au and containing 247,000 ounces Au in the Inferred category. (The Historical Estimate is based on the March 2011 NI 43-101 technical report on the DAC Deposit authored by Todd McCracken, P.Geo., who is an independent qualified person pursuant to NI 43-101 working for Wardrop and prepared for Alto Ventures Ltd., a previous owner of the Property. Management of the Company believes that the Historical Estimate is reliable based on the fact that it was prepared by a qualified person with extensive experience in Archean and Proterozoic gold deposits, working for a world-renowned resource firm. In order to bring this Historical Estimate to current relevance, the estimate needs to be re-generated using current economic parameters in the context of the current gold price environment and latest costing estimates. The key assumptions and parameters of the Historical Estimate are as follows: (i) drill holes used: 152; (ii) gold price of US$973/oz; (iii) strip ratio: 4:1; (iv) cut-off grade: 0.5 g/t Au; (v) FX Rate: 1.02 CAD - 1.00 USD; (vi) gold recovery: 94%; (vii) operating cost: $14.30/tonne; and (viii) operating rate: 10,000 tpd. Furthermore, the Company would like to note that the Historical Estimate's global block model statistics showed good agreement between all three separate modeling methods, including ordinary kriging, inverse distance squared and nearest neighbour. The Historical Estimate does not use categories other than the ones set out in Sections 1.2 and 1.3 of NI 43-101.) Story Continues The Historical Estimate was generated using a gold price of US$973/oz and a CAD:USD exchange rate of 1.02. The updated MRE will be generated in the context of the current gold price and exchange rates, which are much more favourable for overall project economics than in 2011. The updated MRE and Technical Report will also incorporate results from an additional ~10,000 m of drilling that was completed on the Project in 2020. Management believes that gold mineralization is open at the DAC Deposit along strike, at depth and on parallel structures on the Property. This resource expansion potential is in addition to the potential to explore for, and establish, independent mineral resource estimates on four other mineralized zones that have previously been identified on the Property. Management plans to announce the details of its multi-phased exploration plan for Destiny in the coming weeks. Independent Qualified Person For the purposes of this engagement, Mr. Todd McCracken, P.Geo., of BBA, will act as the Independent Qualified Person (the \" QP \") as defined by NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum. Mr. McCracken was also the QP for the 2011 Historical Estimate and technical report on Destiny, and hence, is very familiar with the Project. Mr. McCracken has over 32 years of experience in mineral exploration, mine operations, resource estimation and consulting. Mr. McCracken's commodities expertise includes gold, base metals, nickel-PGE, lithium pegmatite, and vanadium. He has worked on projects across Canada and internationally. Mr. McCracken is an in-house authority on NI 43-101 standards at BBA, where he leads the Mining and Geology group that specializes in project management, QA/QC programs, due diligence reviews, resource estimations, mine design, ventilation, rock mechanics, preliminary economic analysis, prefeasibility studies and feasibility studies. About Caprock Mining Corp. Caprock Mining Corp. is a Canadian mineral exploration company focused on exploring precious metals in Quebec and Ontario. The Company has an option to earn a 100% interest in the Destiny gold property that comprises 127 mineral claims and encompasses an area of 5,013 hectares located less than two hours' drive from Val D'Or, Quebec. Destiny lies along a major deformation corridor in the Abitibi greenstone belt that includes the prolific Cadillac-Larder Lake, Destor-Porcupine and Casa Berardi fault zones which host numerous producing and development-stage gold deposits. The Project overlies a 6.0 km long segment of the poorly explored Despinassay shear zone which is a splay off the regional Chicobi Fault. One of the several gold deposits discovered on Destiny is the DAC Deposit which has a near-surface, NI 43-101 compliant mineral resource estimate (the \" Historical Estimate \") published in 2011 comprising the following gold inventory: 10.8 million tonnes averaging 1.05 g/t Au and containing 364,000 ounces Au in the Indicated category; and 8.3 million tonnes averaging 0.92 g/t Au and containing 247,000 ounces Au in the Inferred category.

CSTL SPRO CTMX Shares of Capricor Therapeutics CAPR gained 8.4% on Thursday following the completion of the submission of a biologics license application (BLA) to the FDA seeking full approval for deramiocel to treat patients diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) cardiomyopathy. CAPR\u2019s lead product candidate and only clinical pipeline asset, deramiocel, is an investigational, allogeneic cardiac-derived cell therapy. A final decision of the FDA is anticipated in the second half of 2024. Capricor initiated its rolling submission process for the deramiocel BLA in October 2024, based on a successful pre-BLA meeting with the FDA. The completion of the submission process has also triggered a $10 million milestone payment from its distribution partner, Nippon Shinyaku, under the terms of the companies\u2019 U.S. Commercialization and Distribution Agreement. The impending influx of cash is set to strengthen CAPR\u2019s cash position. The company has requested the FDA to grant priority review to the BLA. A filing accepted under the regulatory body\u2019s Priority Review pathway reduces the review period to six months from the standard 10 months. This status is given to treatments that the FDA believes can significantly improve existing options or provide solutions where no approved therapy exists. In the past three months, shares of Capricor have plunged 30.9% compared with the industry\u2019s 2.7% decline. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research More on CAPR\u2019s BLA Submission for Deramiocelto Treat DMD Capricor\u2019s BLA for deramiocel to treat DMD cardiomyopathy is supported by its cardiac data from its phase II HOPE-2 and HOPE-2 Open Label Extension (OLE) studies compared to natural history data. In June 2024, the company announced favorable three-year results from the HOPE-2 OLE study of deramiocel for the DMD indication. Per the data readout, a statistically significant reduction in the decline of upper limb function (PUL 2.0) and stabilization of left ventricular ejection fraction among deramiocel-treated patients was observed over three years. This contrasts sharply with the expected decline observed in untreated DMD patients, suggesting that deramiocel can potentially slow disease progression and improve quality of life. Deramiocel also demonstrated a well-tolerated safety profile throughout the study. Deramiocel enjoys the Orphan Drug designation in the United States and the EU for the treatment of DMD. Additionally, subject to the FDA approval of the deramiocel BLA for DMD cardiomyopathy, Capricor would be eligible to receive a Priority Review Voucher based on its previous receipt of a rare pediatric disease designation. Story Continues CAPR\u2019s Next Steps in the Deramiocel Developmental Program Capricor plans to later expand the label of deramiocel to include the treatment of skeletal muscle myopathy. To achieve the same, CAPR expects to report clinical data on skeletal muscle myopathy by combining Cohorts A and B from the phase III HOPE-3 study as part of a post-approval study. Additionally, the HOPE-3 study results may support marketing approvals outside the United States, if needed. Capricor has already started regulatory processes in the EU and Japan and will collaborate with health authorities to streamline the approval process for deramiocel in these regions. DMD is a serious genetic disorder showing progressive weakness and chronic inflammation of the skeletal, heart and respiratory muscles with mortality at a median age of approximately 30 years. Per Capricor, DMD occurs in approximately one in every 3,500 male births and the patient population is estimated to be approximately 15,000-20,000 alone in the United States. Present treatment options are limited and there is no cure for the disease. According to a Mordor Intelligence\u00a0report, the DMD treatment market size is estimated at $4.07 billion in 2025 and is expected to reach $9.78 billion by 2030, witnessing a CAGR of 19.13%. Thus, the DMD market offers a lucrative opportunity. Capricor Therapeutics, Inc. Price and Consensus Capricor Therapeutics, Inc.

Announces Closing of Private Placement and Completes Issuance of First Tranche of Shares Pursuant to Destiny Gold Project Option Agreement Newsfile Corp. Wed, Jan 1, 2025, 12:15 AM 6 min read In This Article: CAPR.CN Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - December 31, 2024) - Caprock Mining Corp. (CSE: CAPR) (\" Caprock \" or the \" Company \") is pleased to announce that it has closed the financing of hard dollar units (the \" HD Units \") to raise aggregate gross proceeds of $292,125 and flow through units (\" FT Units \") to raise aggregate gross proceeds of $115,000, as previously announced in the Company's press release dated December 20, 2024. Concurrently with the completion of the financing the Company has also issued the first tranche of common shares owing to Big Ridge Gold Corp. (the \" Optionor \") under an option agreement (the \" Option Agreement\") that the Company entered into with respect to the Destiny gold property (the \" Destiny Project \") located near Val D'Or, Quebec (see press release dated December 4, 2024). The issuance is comprised of 8,000,000 common shares issued at a deemed issue price of $0.05 per share. Caprock's President & CEO Mr. Vishal Gupta stated, \"We are excited to finally close on what we believe to be a transformative transaction for Caprock. Situated in a world-class gold district, the Destiny gold project is due for an updated NI 43-101 mineral resource estimate that incorporates current economics and the results of a sizeable drill program completed in 2020. We look forward to announcing the details of our multi-phased strategic plan for Destiny in the coming weeks, which will commence with an updated mineral resource estimate in Q1 2025. We will also outline our plans for the potential expansion of the updated mineral resource estimate through systematic drilling in several prospective zones identified by dozens of historical drill holes covering a considerable mineralized strike length beyond the resource zone.\" Details of the Financing Each HD Unit was issued at a price at $0.025 and is comprised of one common share and one common share purchase warrant (a \" Warrant \"). Each Warrant is exercisable to purchase one common share of the Company at any time on or before December 31, 2026 at a price of $0.06. Each FT Unit will qualify as a \"flow-through share\" (within the meaning of subsection 66(15) of the Income Tax Act (Canada). Each FT Unit was issued at a price at $0.04 and is comprised of one flow-through common share and one Warrant. The securities issued in connection with the financing are subject to a four-month hold period expiring on the date that is four months and one day following the issuance of the HD Units and FT Units. Story Continues An aggregate of $29,210 was paid to certain finders and an aggregate of 230,000 finder warrants were issued to certain finders in connection with the financing. Each finder warrant entitles the finder to acquire one HD Unit at a price of $0.025 at any time on or before December 31, 2026. Use of Proceeds The gross proceeds from the sale of FT Units will be used by the Company to incur eligible \"Canadian exploration expenses\" that qualify as \"flow-through mining expenditures\" (as both terms are defined in the Income Tax Act (Canada)) (the \" Qualifying Expenditures \") related to the Destiny Project. The Qualifying Expenditures will be renounced in favour of the subscribers with an effective date of December 31, 2024. In addition, with respect to subscribers who are eligible individuals under the Taxation Act (Qu\u00e9bec), the Qualifying Expenditures will also qualify for inclusion in the \"exploration base relating to certain Qu\u00e9bec exploration expenses\" within the meaning of section 726.4.10 of the Taxation Act (Qu\u00e9bec) and for inclusion in the \"exploration base relating to certain Qu\u00e9bec surface mining exploration expenses\" within the meaning of section 726.4.17.2 of the Taxation Act (Qu\u00e9bec). The net proceeds from the sale of the HD Units are expected to be used for expenditures on the Destiny Project as well as general working capital. The securities issued under the financing have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any U.S. state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons absent registration or any applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable U.S. state securities laws.

Treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Capricor Therapeutics Thu, Jan 2, 2025, 5:15 PM 6 min read In This Article: CAPR Capricor Therapeutics -If approved, deramiocel would be first approved therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy cardiomyopathy- -BLA submission triggers $10 million milestone payment to Capricor from Nippon Shinyaku- SAN DIEGO, Jan. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Capricor Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CAPR), a biotechnology company developing transformative cell and exosome-based therapeutics for the treatment of rare diseases, today announced the completion of the submission of its Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking full approval for deramiocel, an investigational cell therapy, to treat patients diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) cardiomyopathy. \u201cThe submission of the BLA marks a pivotal step for Capricor and those impacted by DMD. This BLA is the culmination of a body of work that has been focused on bringing this potentially transformational therapy to those patients in need,\u201d said Linda Marb\u00e1n, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Capricor. \u201cWe believe that the strength of this application is that deramiocel has shown in multiple clinical trials attenuation of the cardiac implications of DMD. We look forward to working with the FDA throughout the review process to support this potential approval.\u201d The full submission of the rolling BLA was completed as the Company had previously guided in late December 2024 and is supported by Capricor\u2019s existing cardiac data from its Phase 2 HOPE-2 and HOPE-2 Open Label Extension (OLE) trials compared to natural history data from an FDA funded and published dataset on the implications of DMD cardiomyopathy and potential biomarkers of disease progression. Capricor has requested a priority review, which, if granted, would reduce the review timeline from the standard 10-month to a priority 6-month review from the date the submission is accepted by the FDA. In conjunction with this achievement, Capricor will receive a milestone payment of $10 million from its distribution partner, Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd., under the terms of its U.S. Commercialization and Distribution Agreement. Deramiocel for the treatment of DMD, has received\u00a0Orphan Drug Designation\u00a0from the FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA). The regulatory pathway for deramiocel is supported by RMAT (Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy Designation) in the U.S. and the Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product\u00a0(ATMP) Designation in the European region. In addition, if Capricor were to receive FDA marketing approval for deramiocel regarding the treatment of DMD, Capricor would be eligible to receive a Priority Review Voucher (PRV) based on its previous receipt of a rare pediatric disease designation. Story Continues About Deramiocel Deramiocel (CAP-1002) consists of allogeneic cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs), a population of stromal cells that have been shown in preclinical and clinical studies to exert potent immunomodulatory, antifibrotic and regenerative actions in dystrophinopathy and heart failure. CDCs act by secreting extracellular vesicles known as exosomes, which target macrophages and alter their expression profile so that they adopt a healing, rather than a pro-inflammatory, phenotype. CDCs have been the subject of over 100 peer-reviewed scientific publications and have been administered to over 200 human subjects across several clinical trials. About Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a devastating genetic disorder characterized by progressive weakness and chronic inflammation of the skeletal, heart and respiratory muscles with mortality at a median age of approximately 30 years. It is estimated that DMD occurs in approximately one in every 3,500 male births and that the patient population is estimated to be approximately 15,000-20,000 in the United States. DMD pathophysiology is driven by the impaired production of functional dystrophin, which normally functions as a structural protein in muscle. The reduction of functional dystrophin in muscle cells leads to significant cell damage and ultimately causes muscle cell death and fibrotic replacement. In DMD patients, heart muscle cells progressively die and are replaced with scar tissue. This cardiomyopathy eventually leads to heart failure, which is currently the leading cause of death among those with DMD. Treatment options are limited and there is no cure. About Capricor Therapeutics Capricor Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: CAPR) is a biotechnology company dedicated to advancing transformative cell and exosome-based therapeutics to redefine the treatment landscape for rare diseases. At the forefront of our innovation is our lead product candidate, deramiocel (CAP-1002), an allogeneic cardiac-derived cell therapy. Extensive preclinical and clinical studies have shown deramiocel to demonstrate immunomodulatory, antifibrotic, and regenerative actions specifically tailored for dystrophinopathies and heart disease. Deramiocel is currently in late-stage development for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Capricor is also harnessing the power of its exosome technology, using its proprietary StealthX\u2122 platform in preclinical development focused on the areas of vaccinology, targeted delivery of oligonucleotides, proteins and small molecule therapeutics to potentially treat and prevent a diverse array of diseases.

In addition, with respect to subscribers who are eligible individuals under the Taxation Act (Qu\u00e9bec), the Qualifying Expenditures will also qualify for inclusion in the \"exploration base relating to certain Qu\u00e9bec exploration expenses\" within the meaning of section 726.4.10 of the Taxation Act (Qu\u00e9bec) and for inclusion in the \"exploration base relating to certain Qu\u00e9bec surface mining exploration expenses\" within the meaning of section 726.4.17.2 of the Taxation Act (Qu\u00e9bec). The net proceeds from the sale of the HD Units are expected to be used for expenditures on the Destiny Project as well as general working capital. Certain finders are entitled to receive finder's fees of up to 8% of the proceeds from investors introduced by the finder together with finder warrants entitling the finder to acquire a number of HD Units equal to 8% of the number of HD Units or FT Units purchased by investors introduced to the Company by the finder. Each finder warrant will entitle the holder to acquire one HD Unit at a price of $0.025 for a period of two years following the closing date. Story Continues Option Agreement Share Issuance Concurrently with the completion of the financing the Company is also expected to issue the initial tranche of common shares owing to Big Ridge Gold Corp. (the \" Optionor \") under the Option Agreement. The issuance will be comprised of 8,000,000 common shares issued at a deemed issue price of $0.05 per share. As the Optionor is the holder of approximately 19.3% of the outstanding common shares of the Company the Option Agreement constitutes a related party transaction under applicable securities laws. The transaction was negotiated by Vishal Gupta and Daniel Cohen on behalf of the Company as they are independent of the Optionor. Disinterested shareholder approval of the transaction was obtained at the annual and special meeting of shareholders of the Company held on November 7, 2024. The securities issued under the Offering have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any U.S. state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons absent registration or any applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable U.S. state securities laws.

Wed, Dec 4, 2024, 6:35 PM 5 min read In This Article: CAPR.CN Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - December 4, 2024) - Caprock Mining Corp. (CSE: CAPR) (\" Caprock \" or the \" Company \") is pleased to announce that, further to its press releases dated September 23, 2024 and November 1, 2024, it has entered into a binding option agreement dated December 3 rd , 2024 (the \" Option Agreement \") setting out the terms of an option to acquire a 100% interest in the Destiny gold property (\" Destiny \", or the \" Property \") located near Val D'Or, Quebec from Big Ridge Gold Corp. (the \" Optionor \") (the \" Transaction \"). Destiny comprises 127 mineral claims that collectively span an area of 5,013 hectares located less than two hours' drive from Val D'Or. The project lies along a major deformation corridor in the Abitibi greenstone belt that includes the prolific Cadillac-Larder Lake and Destor-Porcupine fault zones which host numerous producing and development-stage gold deposits that are in close proximity to Destiny (see Figure 1). The project overlies a 6.0 km long segment of the poorly explored Despinassay shear zone which is a splay off the regional Chicobi Fault. One of the several gold deposits discovered on the Property is the DAC Deposit which has a near-surface, National Instrument 43-101 (\" NI 43-101 \") compliant mineral resource estimate (\" MRE \") comprising the following gold inventory: 10.8 million tonnes averaging 1.05 g/t Au and containing 364,000 ounces Au in the Indicated category; and 8.3 million tonnes averaging 0.92 g/t Au and containing 247,000 ounces Au in the Inferred category. (The above is based on the March 2011 NI 43-101 technical report on the DAC Deposit authored by Todd McCracken, P.Geo., who is an independent qualified person pursuant to NI 43-101. The MRE was established using a gold price of US$973 per ounce Au and a cut-off grade of 0.5 g/t Au.). Management believes that gold mineralization is open at the DAC Deposit along strike, at depth and on parallel structures on the Property. This resource expansion potential is in addition to the potential to explore for, and establish, independent mineral resource estimates on several of the other deposits that have previously been identified on the Property through exploration drilling. Terms of the Transaction Pursuant to the Option Agreement, Caprock has an option to acquire a 100% interest in the Property by incurring the following obligations over the course of three years (which may be accelerated at Caprock's option) from the date of the closing of the Transaction (the \" Closing Date \"): Story Continues Issuance of 8,000,000 common shares of the Company on the Closing Date at a deemed issue price of $0.05 per common share for a total deemed value of $400,000; Payment of $100,000 in cash and $250,000 in common shares of the Company on or before the 1-year anniversary of the Closing Date with the number of shares being based on a per share deemed issue price equal to the greater of (i) the 20-day volume weighted average price (\"VWAP\") for the 20 days preceding the date of issuance of the additional common shares and (ii) $0.05; Payment of $250,000 in cash and $350,000 in common shares of the Company on or before the 2-year anniversary of the Closing Date with the number of shares being based on a per share deemed issue price equal to the greater of (i) the 20-day VWAP for the 20 days preceding the date of issuance of the additional common shares and (ii) $0.05; Payment of $400,000 in cash and $700,000 in common shares of the Company on or before the 3-year anniversary of the Closing Date with the number of shares being based on a per share deemed issue price equal to the greater of (i) the 20-day VWAP for the 20 days preceding the date of issuance of the additional common shares and (ii) $0.05; Incurring qualified expenditures on the Property totaling $2,450,000 with the following breakdown: $200,000 on or before the 1-year anniversary of the Closing Date; an additional $750,000 on or before the 2-year anniversary of the Closing Date; and an additional $1,500,000 on or before the 3-year anniversary of the Closing Date. All common shares of the Company to be issued to the Optionor pursuant to the terms of the Transaction will be subject to a four-month statutory hold period from the date of issuance. Upon the completion of the above obligations by Caprock, the Optionor will retain a 1% NSR on the Property, all of which could be purchased by Caprock for $1,000,000 at any time.

As the Optionor is the holder of approximately 19.3% of the outstanding common shares the Transaction will constitute a related party transaction under applicable securities laws. The Transaction was negotiated by Vishal Gupta and Daniel Cohen on behalf of the Company as they are independent of the Optionor. Disinterested shareholder approval of the Transaction was obtained at the annual and special meeting of shareholders of the Company held on November 7, 2024. The scientific and technical information disclosed in this release has been reviewed and approved by Mr. Vishal Gupta, the Company's President & CEO. Mr. Gupta is a P.Geo. registered with the Professional Geoscientists of Ontario (PGO), and a. \"qualified person\" as defined under National Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. The source of the historical resources estimate (the \"Historical Estimate\") was a NI 43-101 technical report dated March 1, 2011 authored by Todd McCracken, P.Geo. working for Wardrop and prepared for Alto Ventures Ltd., a previous owner of the Property. Management of the Company believes that the Historical Estimate is reliable based on the fact that it was prepared by a qualified person with extensive experience in Archean and Proterozoic gold deposits, working for a world-renowned resource firm. In order to bring this Historical Estimate to current relevance, the estimate needs to be re-generated using current economic parameters in the context of the current gold price environment and latest costing estimates. The key assumptions and parameters of the Historical Estimate are as follows: (i) drill holes used: 152; (ii) gold price of US$973/oz; (iii) strip ratio: 4:1; (iv) cut-off grade: 0.5 g/t Au; (v) FX Rate: 1.02 CAD - 1.00 USD; (vi) gold recovery: 94%; (vii) operating cost: $14.30/tonne; and (viii) operating rate: 10,000 tpd. Furthermore, the Company would like to note that the Historical Estimate's global block model statistics showed good agreement between all three separate modeling methods, including ordinary kriging, inverse distance squared and nearest neighbour. The Historical Estimate does not use categories other than the ones set out in Sections 1.2 and 1.3 of NI 43-101. Approximately 10,000 metres of diamond drilling was conducted on the Property subsequent to the Historical Estimate, and the Company needs to complete check assays on drill core and re-generate the resource estimate through a third-party qualified person. The updated resource estimate, if completed, is expected to take into account the ~10,000 metres of additional drilling, and present-day gold economics. The Company confirms that a qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the Historical Estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves, and the Company is not treating the Historical Estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves.

min read In This Article: CAPR Capricor Therapeutics (CAPR) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.38 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.34. This compares to loss of $0.25 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -11.76%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this biotechnology company would post a loss of $0.32 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.35, delivering a surprise of -9.38%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once. Capricor , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Products industry, posted revenues of $2.26 million for the quarter ended September 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 43.95%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $6.19 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Capricor shares have added about 270.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 25.5%. What's Next for Capricor? While Capricor has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Capricor: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.33 on $5.14 million in revenues for the coming quarter and -$1.17 on $18.06 million in revenues for the current fiscal year. Story Continues Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.
