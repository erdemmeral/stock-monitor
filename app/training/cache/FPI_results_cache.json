The reason is simple: from 1964 to 2023, his company, Berkshire Hathaway, delivered an astonishing overall gain of 4,384,748% . That kind of success has created immense wealth for its shareholders \u2014 including Buffett himself. Forbes estimates his net worth at $143.5 billion , placing him among the world\u2019s richest individuals. Don't miss Rich, young Americans are ditching the stormy stock market \u2014 here are the alternative assets they're banking on instead Trump says trade tariffs could hit Canada, Mexico and China as early as Feb. 1 \u2014 but US economists warn it could effectively 'tax' Americans instead. Here\u2019s why and how to protect your money ASAP These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2025 \u2014 and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how But the stock market is unpredictable, and not everyone shares Buffett\u2019s track record. We\u2019ve all heard cautionary tales of investors losing fortunes chasing stock tips. Buffett believes many investors fall into a fundamental trap. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Buffett was asked what he sees as the biggest mistake investors make. His response was immediate : \u201cThey just don't realize that all you have to do is just buy a cross section of America, and they never listen to people like me or read the papers or do anything subsequently. They think that because you can trade, you should trade.\u201d Put simply, investors trade too often. Buffett attributes this issue to the stock market\u2019s low transaction costs compared to other asset classes. \u201cYou buy a farm, you buy an apartment house, you can't resell it tomorrow [because of] the cost of moving around. Now you get something handed to you \u2014 liquidity, which in an instant, you can sell, and the cost of doing it are pennies compared to other kinds of investment activity. So because they can so easily move around, they do move around and moving around is not smart in investing,\u201d he explained. In other words, just because you can trade frequently doesn\u2019t mean you should. \u2018The best thing to do\u2019 Buffett\u2019s message is clear \u2014 long-term success in investing doesn\u2019t require constant buying and selling. Instead, he advocates owning a \u201ccross section of America.\u201d This philosophy stems from his unwavering confidence in the U.S. economy. \u201cAmerican business \u2014 and consequently a basket of stocks \u2014 is virtually certain to be worth far more in the years ahead,\u201d Buffett wrote in his 2016 letter to shareholders . Berkshire\u2019s own investment strategy reflects this belief. Its $295-billion equity portfolio is heavily weighted towards American companies across diverse industries, reinforcing Buffett\u2019s faith in the nation\u2019s long-term economic strength. Continua a leggere For those unsure about which American businesses to invest in, Buffett offers a straightforward solution: \u201cIn my view, for most people, the best thing to do is own the S&P 500 index fund,\u201d he famously stated . This straightforward approach gives investors exposure to 500 of America\u2019s largest companies across various industries, providing diversified exposure without the need for constant monitoring or active trading. Buffett\u2019s commitment to this strategy is evident in his estate planning: he has directed that 90% of his wife\u2019s inheritance be invested in \u201ca very low-cost S&P 500 index fund\u201d after his passing. The beauty of this approach is its accessibility \u2014 anyone, regardless of wealth, can take advantage of it. Even small amounts can grow over time, and some apps even let you invest in an S&P 500 ETF with your spare change , making it easier than ever to build wealth alongside the world\u2019s financial elite.

Protect your nest egg now Buffett likes productive assets Buffett\u2019s point about how \u201cyou can\u2019t resell it tomorrow\u201d when investing in farmland or apartment buildings is worth highlighting. Unlike stocks, which can be traded instantly, real assets come with higher transaction costs \u2014 but that\u2019s not necessarily a drawback. Investors typically aren\u2019t looking for quick flips; they\u2019re in it for the long-term income these assets generate. With farmland, you can earn money through crop sales or leasing fees. With rental properties, you can collect monthly rental income \u2014 both providing a steady cash flow while the asset itself appreciates over time. Buffett has personal experience with both. In 1986, he bought a 400-acre farm near Omaha, and in 1993 he acquired a New York retail property next to NYU. His verdict? \u201cThe two investments will be solid and satisfactory holdings for my lifetime and, subsequently, for my children and grandchildren,\u201d he wrote in his 2013 letter to Berkshire shareholders . He also predicted that the income from the two investments \u201cwill probably increase in the decades to come.\u201d Today, you don\u2019t need to buy a whole farm or an entire building to invest in these asset classes. Investors can gain exposure through real estate investment trusts ( REITs ), which own income-producing real estate. Different REITs specialize in various property types. For instance, Equity Residential (EQR) focuses on apartment buildings, while Farmland Partners (FPI) invests in farmland. Alternatively, crowdfunding platforms have made it easier for average Americans to invest in rental properties without the need for a hefty down payment or the burden of property management. Some platforms will even let you start earning rental income with investments as low as $100.

Balance: India's Economy in a Period of Caution Amid Rising Pressures - DUN & BRADSTREET PR Newswire Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 11:23 AM 6 min read MUMBAI, India , Jan. 24, 2025 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0Dun & Bradstreet, a global leader in business decisioning data and analytics, has released its Economy Observer report for January 2025 . Economy Observer is a monthly report sharing in-depth analysis of key macroeconomic developments in India and provides forecasts for key economic indicators, and insight into the expected direction of the Indian economy. Dun & Bradstreet India Logo Key economic forecast: Real Economy : India's economy appears to be in a cyclical downturn, with activity slowing in the first half of FY2024-25. This deceleration has been driven by\u00a0macroprudential tightening in lending, reduced public expenditure in an election year, and a cyclical slowdown in private consumption and investment, as reflected in high-frequency indicators. The National Statistical Office projects real GDP growth at 6.4% for the fiscal year 2024-25, weighed down by slower mining and manufacturing activities. Dun & Bradstreet expects IIP growth to moderate to 4.0% in December 2024 , reflecting both global uncertainties and domestic pressures, with industrial production momentum cooling as the base effect normalizes. The February budget will play a crucial role in addressing subdued public spending and stimulating growth. To boost consumption, especially in rural and urban areas, we anticipate enhanced allocations for programs like MGNREGA, PM KISAN, and PMAY, along with potential tax incentives to promote rural and urban spending. At the same time, we expect driving investment growth to remain a key focus, with an expected Rs 1 -1.5 lakh crore increase in capital expenditure over FY25's revised estimates. The government's borrowing program is likely to rise only marginally to around Rs 15 lakh crore, which should keep bond yields stable. Meanwhile, the fiscal deficit is expected to undershoot the 4.9% target for FY25 by ~10 bps, with a further reduction to 4.3-4.4% targeted for FY26BE. Overall, while the first half of the fiscal year has been challenging, the second half is expected to see gradual improvement, supported by government measures to drive consumption and investment amid a slowing global growth environment. Price Scenario : India's price scenario in December 2024 showed mixed trends, with WPI inflation rising to 2.4% y/y from 1.9% in November, driven by higher input costs and global commodity pressures. Dun & Bradstreet projects WPI inflation to reach 3.0% in January 2025 , reflecting persistent inflationary pressures. CPI inflation eased slightly to 5.2% in December 2024\u00a0from 5.5% in November 2024 , but rural inflation remained elevated at 5.8% compared to 4.6% in urban areas in December 2024 , driven by higher costs for essential goods. Food inflation, at 8.39% y/y, continued to be a concern, particularly in rural areas . Dun & Bradstreet expects CPI inflation to rise to 5.8% y/y in January, driven by food and fuel cost pressures, increased rural demand, and global uncertainties . Story Continues Money & Finance: The 91-day Treasury Bill yield remained stable at 6.6% in December 2024 , up from 6.5% in November. Dun & Bradstreet forecasts the rate to remain at 6.6% in January 2025 , reflecting expectations of continued cautious monetary policy. Similarly, the 10-year G-Sec yield increased to 6.9% in December 2024 , from 6.8% in November 2024 . Dun & Bradstreet expects 10-year G-sec to stay at 6.9% in January 2025 due to ongoing inflation concerns and fiscal challenges. Bank credit growth moderated to 11.2% in December, down from 12.1% in November, as high-interest rates and economic uncertainty curbed lending activity . Dun & Bradstreet expects bank credit growth to stabilize at 11.5% in January 2025 , reflecting cautious optimism and a focus on managing credit risk . Deposit growth also moderated to 9.8% in December, likely influenced by shifting consumer spending and saving patterns amid a tighter monetary environment. External Sector: India's external sector is facing significant pressure, with the Indian Rupee (INR) depreciating sharply amid a slowdown in foreign portfolio investor (FPI) activity. In December 2024 , the INR/USD exchange rate stood at 85.0, and it is expected to weaken further to 86.3 by January 2025 . Dun & Bradstreet is forecasting further depreciation, with the exchange rate potentially reaching 86.7 in February 2025 , driven by a stronger US dollar, global economic uncertainties, higher oil prices, and capital outflows. Dr.\u00a0Arun Singh, Global Chief Economist, Dun & Bradstreet said,\u00a0\" India's economy is likely in a cyclical downturn, but the outlook for the second half of FY2024-25 is brighter, supported by government measures to boost investment and consumption. With a projected Rs 1 -1.5 lakh crore increase in capital expenditure and enhanced allocations for rural programs, growth momentum is expected to strengthen. Stable bond yields, an improving fiscal deficit, and targeted public spending position India to weather global challenges and sustain economic resilience.\" D&B's Economy Observer Forecast Variables Forecast Latest Period Previous period IIP Growth 4.0% Dec-24 5.2% Nov-24 3.5% Oct-24 Inflation WPI 3.0% Jan-25 2.4% Dec-24 1.9% Nov-24 CPI (Combined) 5.8% Jan-25 5.2% Dec-24 5.5% Nov-24 Exchange Rate (INR/USD) ** 86.7 Feb-25 86.3 Jan-25 85.0 Dec-24 91-day T-Bills* 6.6% Jan-25 6.6% Dec-24 6.5% Nov-24 10-year G-Sec Yield* 6.9% Jan-25 6.9% Dec-24 6.8% Nov-24 Bank Credit 11.5% Jan-25 11.2% Dec-24 12.1% Nov-24 *Weekly Average ** Dun and Bradstreet Forecasts About Dun & Bradstreet: Dun & Bradstreet, a leading global provider of business decisioning data and analytics, enables companies around the world to improve their business performance.

MacKenzie Capital Management, LP Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 5:30 PM 3 min read In This Article: MKZR +5.91% MacKenzie Capital Management, LP ORINDA, Calif., Jan. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MacKenzie Realty Capital, Inc . (Nasdaq: MKZR) (\u201cMacKenzie\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is pleased to announce an update on its development called Aurora at Green Valley, in Fairfield, CA. Highlights: Our Aurora project is progressing on schedule with no delays. See www.wisemanco.com/property/aurora-at-green-valley/ The schedule continues to indicate occupancy will begin during the third quarter for the first residential building, with the other two buildings delivered by the end of the year. Sunrise Center clubhouse, with leasing offices, is scheduled to be delivered 45 days prior to the first residential building to assist in leasing activities. That building already has drywall installed. Indoor and outdoor furniture and fitness room equipment has been ordered. Prior to opening of Sunrise Center, we will conduct pre-leasing activities from a professional office located in a nearby office building owned by an affiliate of MRC Aurora, LLC. FPI, our independent property manager, is the biggest manager in northern California in terms of units managed. The project has had minimal overruns \u2013 right now we forecast a total use of only 23% of the contingencies provided in our budget. Next month we expect to commence drawing on our construction loan facility, as we will have invested our $12.5 million cash equity. Our lender is Valley Strong Credit Union and they have already begun performing inspections so that our draw process is expected to be smooth. Market occupancies for similar projects are maintaining at 95% occupancy, including Nova, the newest large project in Green Valley which has now stabilized its 281 units at that 95% level. Rents in this market increased by 25% between 2021 and 2023. Rents pulled back a bit at the end of 2023, but have resumed a positive trend and are now just about 3% off the rental peak established in 2023. We believe there is not enough new product in this growth market to satisfy demand. Robert Dixon, Chief Executive Officer at MacKenzie stated, \u201cWe are excited about the progress we are making in developing the Aurora project and are committed to be helping meet the continued demand for housing in the San Francisco Bay Area. This development is staying on the budget and schedule we initially disclosed. I want to thank our team here at MacKenzie as well as all the contractors and subcontractors involved.\u201d About MacKenzie Realty Capital, Inc.

The fund was in the bottom decile of performance for its category during the calendar years 2016, 2018, and 2022. \"The repeat performance in 2024 of the STF fund is a result of our team's ability to identify and capitalize on trends while also enhancing our model to evolve with the markets and volatility. The fact that the fund leads in the category for the five-year period, as well, speaks to our objective to provide consistency and predictability in our strategies. STF can be positioned up to two-times long versus the NASDAQ 100\u00ae Index and up to one-times short, depending upon market direction and conditions. While sometimes volatile, the ability to go long and short is part of our dynamic, risk management approach,\" said Jerry Wagner , founder and president of FPI and one of the portfolio managers for the 14 Quantified Funds. Mr. Wagner further added \"Flexible Plan uses the fund extensively in its most popular dynamic, risk-managed SMA strategy: QFC Self-Adjusting Trend Following.\u00a0 Although the fund is aggressive and has even found itself ranked for some years at or near the bottom of its category, using the strategy version reduces its volatility.\u00a0 Another popular FPI strategy, QFC Equity Trends, further reduces the volatility to allow its use with growth investors.\u00a0 Finally, investors with a wide range of suitability profiles can make use of the fund in FPI's Multi-Strategy Portfolios \u2013 available for Conservative, Moderate, Balanced, Growth and Aggressive suitability profiles.\" With respect to the 14 Quantified Funds, Flexible Plan is a subadvisor to Advisors Preferred , a boutique asset manager that manages mutual funds. Advisors Preferred, through its affiliated distributor, Ceros Financial Services, Inc., distributes these funds to financial advisors and financial professionals. Story Continues \"We're thrilled that the STF Fund repeated as the top performer in its category this past year. Knowing that no two years are the same in the markets, we believe this accomplishment speaks to the adaptable, dynamic approach that Flexible Plan employs and shows that strategies like this have a place in professionally managed portfolios,\" said Catherine Ayers-Rigsby , president of Advisors Preferred.

5:56 AM 5 min read SHANGHAI , Jan. 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- IMPACT Therapeutics (\"IMPACT\"), a biopharmaceutical company focusing on the discovery and development of targeted anti-cancer therapeutics based on synthetic lethality, is pleased to announce that\u00a0Senaparib Capsules (\u6d3e\u8212\u5b81 \u00ae \uff09has received marketing authorization in China from National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial (FIGO Stages III and IV) high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Senaparib, discovered and developed by IMPACT, is a potent and novel PARP 1/2 inhibitor. Its distinctive molecular structure provides it with high in vitro and in vivo activity, exceptional target selectivity and wide safety window. The approval is based on FLAMES Study. The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase III clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Senaparib as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of patients with advanced ovarian cancer who had completed first-line chemotherapy and achieved either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). The results of FLAMES Study showed that Senaparib demonstrated significant improvement in median PFS compared to placebo (PFS not reached vs 13.6 months, HR 0.43, P < 0.0001), irrespective of BRCA status. Senaparib demonstrated a tolerable safety profile, with no noticeable safety issues. [1] The results also indicated that both HRD positive and HRD negative populations derived benefit from Senaparib maintenance therapy, highlighting the potential of Senaparib for broad clinical application. The results of this study will strongly support Senaparib as the Standard of Care for first-line maintenance therapy in patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer. The top-line results of the study were initially presented as a late breaking oral presentation at ESMO in 2023 and presented at CSCO 2024. On May 15, 2024 , the internationally renowned medical journal Nature Medicine also published the results titled \"Senaparib as first-line maintenance therapy in advanced ovarian cancer: a randomized phase 3 trial.\" [1] Ovarian cancer is one of the most common lethal female reproductive malignancies. According to GLOBOCAN 2020 data, the global incidence of ovarian cancer is amounted to 310,000 cases and mortality is amounted to 210,000. According to the latest national cancer statistics released by National Cancer Center in 2024, there were 61,100 new cases of ovarian cancer and 32,600 deaths in China in 2022, making it the most lethal gynecological tumor. Due to the insidious and non-specific early symptoms of ovarian cancer, about 80% of patients are already in advanced stage when they are diagnosed, and the 5-year survival rate is only 41.8%. [2] Although ovarian cancer may be resolved after initial platinum-containing chemotherapy, most patients inevitably face recurrence, and there remains a significant unmet clinical need for treatment in the ovarian cancer patient population. Story Continues In recent years, PARP inhibitors are changing the therapeutic landscape of ovarian cancer, with maintenance therapy extending the duration of sustained remission after platinum-containing chemotherapy and delaying disease recurrence. In December 2023 , IMPACT entered into a collaboration agreement with Zhongmei Huadong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, a subsidiary of Huadong Medicine Co., Ltd (SZ.000963) (collectively, \" Huadong Medicine \") for the commercialization of Senaparib. Under the collaboration agreement, Huadong Medicine receives exclusive promotion rights of Senaparib in mainland China . Huadong Medicine is deeply involved in the field of gynecological oncology. Senaparib and Huadong Medicine's approved mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx (ELAHERE\u00ae) can provide solutions for ovarian cancer patients with different stages of the disease, sharing expert networks, research and clinical resources, promoting and developing together to form an effective and highly synergistic relationship. Dr. Sui Xiong Cai , Chief Executive Officer of IMPACT said: \"It is our great pleasure to share with you the successful approval of Senaparib for the Chinese market, which is another strong proof of the excellence of IMPACT's in-house synthetic lethality R&D platform and the R&D execution team. Leveraging Huadong Medicine's extensive commercial experiences in promoting novel therapeutics, we hope that Senaparib will reach more ovarian cancer patients soon and bring new treatment options for first-line maintenance therapy in advanced ovarian cancer.\" [1] . Nature Medicine volume 30, pages1612\u20131621 (2024) [2] . 2023 White paper on the status of diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer in China About IMPACT Therapeutics IMPACT Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery and development of targeted anti-cancer therapeutics based on synthetic lethality. IMPACT Therapeutics has assembled one of the most comprehensive DNA damage responses (DDR) global pipeline of novel drug candidates generated by in-house discovery efforts and is expanding to other novel synthetic lethality targets to broaden its pipeline. IMPACT's pipeline products include PARP inhibitor Senaparib (IMP4297), WEE1 inhibitor (IMP7068), ATR inhibitor (IMP9064), and PARP1 selective inhibitor (IMP1734, in collaboration with Eikon Therapeutics), as well as other novel DDR pathway inhibitors. The most advanced development program, PARP inhibitor Senaparib (IMP4297), has been in clinical Phase II/III studies globally, including China , in ovarian cancer, small cell lung cancer and other indications. The Phase III clinical study (FLAMES Study) of Senaparib for advanced ovarian cancer maintenance treatment following first-line therapy met primary endpoint, with best-in-class efficacy and safety profile. Based on the results of the FLAMES study, the National Medicines Products Administration (NMPA) has approved the new drug application for Senaparib. The Wee1 inhibitor IMP7068 and the ATR inhibitor IMP9064 have been investigated in Phase I clinical studies in several countries and regions around the world, including U.S. and China , and the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) has been established. PARP1 selective inhibitor IMP1734 has obtained IND clearance from FDA and NMPA, as well as completed FPI in early 2024.

Newswire Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 8:38 PM 3 min read FPI's 2024 report reveals industry's accelerated push toward sustainable solutions, increased use of recycled content, and innovations amid evolving consumer and regulatory demands. FALLS CHURCH, Va. , Nov. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- In response to rising requests for insight into the evolving foodservice packaging landscape, the Foodservice Packaging Institute (FPI) has released its 16th annual \"Trends Report\" for 2024. This comprehensive report, crafted from the insights of industry members and FPI staff, highlights the critical trends and emerging pressures facing the foodservice packaging industry. \"The trends we see in this year's report reflect an industry at the crossroads of innovation and adaptation,\" said Natha Dempsey , president of FPI. \"From the rapid push toward meeting ambitious 2025 packaging goals to navigating new regulations, the foodservice packaging industry is facing challenges head-on while seizing opportunities to redefine its future.\" According to the report, sustainability and the principles of sustainable packaging are no longer merely trends but have become essential components of business practice. With increasing legislative mandates pushing for sustainable solutions, companies are hastening their transition to meet 2025 packaging goals, resulting in significant industry pressure. This urgency drives innovation, as noted in the development of new materials and coatings that enhance recyclability and performance. Furthermore, the report highlights a shift towards \"natural\" colored resins and increased use of post-consumer recycled content, a move driven by both regulatory requirements and market demand. The adoption of extended producer responsibility laws in various U.S. states has added complexity, prompting greater focus on reusable items in dining settings. The industry is also adapting to the competitive pressures from increased imports of both products and machinery, which have introduced cost and logistical advantages. Concurrently, automation in manufacturing and service operations is alleviating some of these pressures by increasing production efficiency and addressing labor shortages. Consumer sentiment, influenced by economic factors, is causing a shift in dining behaviors, emphasizing value and influencing profit margins across the supply chain. Despite these challenges, FPI sees opportunities for progress and innovation within the sector. \"For 16 years, our Trends Report has provided a reliable snapshot of where the foodservice packaging industry is heading,\" Dempsey added. \"This year's insights reaffirm the resilience and forward-thinking nature of our industry as it embraces sustainability and innovation.\" Story Continues This annual survey collects opinions from companies throughout the foodservice packaging supply chain, including raw material and machinery suppliers, packaging manufacturers, distributors and operators. The first section of the report compiles direct comments and insights by industry respondents. The second section provides high-level trends in the foodservice packaging industry based on FPI staff analysis of member submissions, as well as FPI's general industry observations. The 2024 Trends Report is available to FPI members. Non-members may view an executive summary on FPI's website . Please contact Ashley Elzinga at aelzinga@fpi.org for more information.

Formosa Prosonic Industries Berhad (KLSE:FPI) editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Mon, Dec 23, 2024, 6:33 AM 6 min read Key Insights Formosa Prosonic Industries Berhad's estimated fair value is RM3.10 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Formosa Prosonic Industries Berhad's RM2.72 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate The average premium for Formosa Prosonic Industries Berhad's competitors is currently 106% Does the December share price for Formosa Prosonic Industries Berhad ( KLSE:FPI ) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example! Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model . See our latest analysis for Formosa Prosonic Industries Berhad The Model We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Seeing as no analyst estimates of free cash flow are available to us, we have extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the company's last reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF (MYR, Millions) RM70.1m RM65.7m RM63.5m RM62.7m RM62.8m RM63.6m RM64.8m RM66.3m RM68.2m RM70.2m Growth Rate Estimate Source Est @ -10.52% Est @ -6.29% Est @ -3.33% Est @ -1.26% Est @ 0.20% Est @ 1.21% Est @ 1.92% Est @ 2.42% Est @ 2.77% Est @ 3.01% Present Value (MYR, Millions) Discounted @ 10% RM63.5 RM53.9 RM47.2 RM42.2 RM38.3 RM35.1 RM32.4 RM30.1 RM28.0 RM26.1 (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = RM397m Story continues We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (3.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 10%. Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = RM70m\u00d7 (1 + 3.6%) \u00f7 (10%\u2013 3.6%) = RM1.1b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = RM1.1b\u00f7 ( 1 + 10%) 10 = RM397m The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is RM794m. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of RM2.7, the company appears about fair value at a 12% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. KLSE:FPI Discounted Cash Flow December 23rd 2024 The Assumptions Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Formosa Prosonic Industries Berhad as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.221. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for Formosa Prosonic Industries Berhad Strength Currently debt free. Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows. Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market. Weakness Earnings declined over the past year. Opportunity Current share price is below our estimate of fair value. Lack of analyst coverage makes it difficult to determine FPI's earnings prospects. Threat No apparent threats visible for FPI. Looking Ahead: Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

December 13, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Farmland Partners Inc. (NYSE: FPI) (the \"Company\" or \"FPI\") today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a one-time dividend of $1.15 per share of common stock and Class A Common OP Unit, payable in cash on January 8, 2025 to shareholders of record on December 23, 2024. The announcement comes at the end of a year that saw the Company sell farmland and related assets for consideration totaling approximately $308 million, generating a total gain for FPI of approximately $51 million, or approximately 20 percent over the aggregate net book value. \"This year has been good for FPI,\" said Luca Fabbri, FPI\u2019s President and CEO. \"The Company achieved sizeable profits on dispositions, trimmed operational expenses, reduced debt exposure, and increased rental rates on the farmland still within its portfolio \u2013 which is some of the best farmland in the world. This special dividend gives us an opportunity to share these successes in a meaningful way with our shareholders, further demonstrating the strength of farmland as an investment class and its historically consistent appreciation.\" The special dividend is required for FPI to remain in compliance with U.S. federal income tax rules for real estate investment trusts (\"REITs\"). The amount of the special dividend has been calculated based on estimates of operating performance for the year ending December 31, 2024, sales expected to be completed by year end, and book-to-tax adjustments. The special dividend is in addition to the quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share of common stock and Class A Common OP Unit that FPI declared on October 29, 2024. For more details on the quarterly dividend, please see \"Note 12\u2014Subsequent Events\" of the Company\u2019s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on October 31, 2024.

adults living with familial chylomicronemia syndrome as an adjunct to diet PR Newswire Fri, Dec 20, 2024, 2:28 AM 10 min read In This Article: IONS +0.72% TRYNGOLZA shown to significantly reduce triglycerides and substantially reduce acute pancreatitis events in adults with FCS; a rare, highly debilitating and life-threatening disease Indicated for adults with\u00a0FCS regardless of genetically or clinically confirmed diagnosis TRYNGOLZA is the first of four independent launches planned over the next three years, pending approvals Ionis to host webcast today at 6:45pm ET CARLSBAD, Calif. , Dec. 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: IONS) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved TRYNGOLZA\u2122 (olezarsen) as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglycerides in adults with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), a rare, genetic form of severe hypertriglyceridemia (sHTG) that can lead to potentially life-threatening acute pancreatitis (AP). TRYNGOLZA is the first-ever\u00a0FDA-approved treatment that significantly and substantially reduces\u00a0triglyceride levels in adults with FCS and provides clinically meaningful reduction in AP events when used with an appropriate diet (\u226420 grams of fat per day). TRYNGOLZA is self-administered via an auto-injector once monthly. Experience the full interactive Multichannel News Release here: https://www.multivu.com/ionis-pharmaceuticals/9295551-en-tryngolza-olezarsen-fda-approval \"Today's FDA approval of TRYNGOLZA heralds the arrival of the first-ever FCS treatment in the U.S. \u2013 a transformational moment for patients and their families. For the first time, adults with FCS can now access a treatment that substantially reduces triglycerides and the risk of debilitating and potentially life-threatening acute pancreatitis,\" said Brett P. Monia , Ph.D., chief executive officer, Ionis. \"We are proud of our long-standing partnership with the FCS community and are grateful to the patients, families and investigators who participated in our clinical studies, enabling Ionis to make this new treatment a reality. The FDA approval of TRYNGOLZA is also a pivotal moment for Ionis, representing our evolution into a fully integrated\u00a0commercial-stage\u00a0biotechnology company \u2013 a goal we set out to achieve five years ago. With our rich pipeline of potentially life-changing medicines, we expect\u00a0TRYNGOLZA to be the first in a steady cadence of innovative medicines we will deliver independently to people living with serious diseases.\" The FDA approval was based on positive data from the global, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 3 Balance clinical trial in adult patients with genetically identified FCS and fasting triglyceride levels \u2265880 mg/dL. In the Balance study, TRYNGOLZA 80 mg demonstrated a statistically significant placebo-adjusted mean reduction in triglyceride levels of 42.5% from baseline to six months (p=0.0084).\u00a0Reductions from baseline to 12 months were further improved, with TRYNGOLZA achieving a placebo-adjusted 57% mean reduction in triglycerides.\u00a0TRYNGOLZA also demonstrated a substantial, clinically meaningful reduction in AP events over 12 months; one patient (5%) experienced one episode of AP in the TRYNGOLZA group compared with seven patients (30%) who experienced 11 total episodes of AP in the placebo group. Story Continues TRYNGOLZA demonstrated a favorable safety profile. The most common adverse reactions (incidence >5% of TRYNGOLZA-treated patients and at a >3% higher frequency than placebo) were injection site reactions (19% and 9%, respectively), decreased platelet count (12% and 4%, respectively) and arthralgia (9% and 0%, respectively). Results from the Phase 3 Balance study were previously published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). \"With no treatment options previously available, we were limited to relying only on extremely strict diet and lifestyle changes as the sole preventative treatment option,\" said Alan Brown , M.D., FNLA, FACC, FAHA, clinical professor of medicine, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science ; Balance trial investigator. \"The FDA approval of TRYNGOLZA is an important moment for people living with FCS, their families and physicians who now, for the first time, have a treatment that significantly lowers triglycerides and decreases the risk of potentially life-threatening acute pancreatitis events, as an adjunct to a low-fat diet. I am excited to have a medicine I can prescribe to my patients that has been shown to change the course of their disease.\" FCS is a rare, genetic, potentially life-threatening form of sHTG that prevents the body from breaking down fats and severely impairs the body's ability to remove triglycerides from the bloodstream due to an impaired function of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL). While healthy levels for adults are below 150 mg/dL, people with FCS often have triglyceride levels of more than 880 mg/dL and often have a history of pancreatitis. Those living with FCS have a high risk of potentially fatal AP, which is a painful inflammation of the pancreas, and chronic health issues such as fatigue and severe, recurrent abdominal pain. People living with FCS can also experience psychological and financial stress, which can significantly impact their quality of life. In the U.S., FCS is estimated to impact up to approximately 3,000 people, the vast majority of whom remain undiagnosed. \"As a rare and difficult to diagnose disease, FCS has a profound impact on the lives of patients and families. Many people living with FCS have experienced severe pain their whole lives \u2013 sometimes so intense they require lengthy hospitalization stays \u2013 and struggle through life with daily fatigue, nausea, brain fog and stomach pain,\" said Lindsey Sutton Bryan , co-founder and co-president, FCS Foundation. \"Until now, our treatment options have been limited, relying on diet alone to try to manage triglyceride levels and keep acute pancreatitis attacks at bay. For the first time, adults with FCS have seen their hope for a treatment become a reality.\" TRYNGOLZA will be available in the U.S. before year end. Ionis is committed to helping people access the medicines they are prescribed and will offer a suite of services designed to meet the unique needs of the FCS community through\u00a0Ionis Every Step\u2122. As part of Ionis Every Step , patients and healthcare providers will have access to services throughout the treatment journey provided by dedicated Patient Education Managers and Ionis Every Step Case Managers, including insurance and affordability support, as well as services and resources, such as disease and nutrition education. Visit TRYNGOLZA.com for more information. TRYNGOLZA was reviewed by the FDA under Priority Review and had previously been granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of FCS, Orphan Drug designation and Breakthrough Therapy designation. Olezarsen is undergoing review in the European Union and regulatory filings in other countries are planned. Olezarsen is currently being evaluated in three Phase 3 clinical trials \u2013 CORE, CORE2 and ESSENCE \u2013 for the treatment of sHTG. Olezarsen has not been reviewed or approved for the treatment of sHTG by regulatory authorities. Webcast Ionis will hold a webcast today at 6:45pm ET\u00a0to discuss the FDA approval. Interested parties may access the webcast here . A webcast replay will be available for a limited time. About TRYNGOLZA\u2122 (olezarsen) TRYNGOLZA\u2122 (olezarsen) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglycerides in adults with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS). TRYNGOLZA is an RNA-targeted medicine designed to lower the body's production of apoC-III, a protein produced in the liver that is a key regulator of triglyceride metabolism. It is the only treatment currently indicated in the U.S. for FCS, a potentially life-threatening disease. For more information about TRYNGOLZA, visit TRYNGOLZA.com . IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION CONTRAINDICATIONS TRYNGOLZA is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious hypersensitivity to TRYNGOLZA or any of the excipients in TRYNGOLZA. Hypersensitivity reactions\u00a0requiring medical treatment have occurred. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions (including symptoms of bronchospasm, diffuse erythema, facial swelling, urticaria, chills and myalgias) have been reported in patients treated with TRYNGOLZA. Advise patients on the signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions and instruct patients to promptly seek medical attention and discontinue use of TRYNGOLZA if hypersensitivity reactions occur. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (incidence >5% of TRYNGOLZA-treated patients and >3% higher frequency than placebo) were injection site reactions, decreased platelet count and arthralgia. Please see full Prescribing Information for TRYNGOLZA. About Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome (FCS) FCS is a rare, genetic disease characterized by extremely elevated triglyceride levels. It is caused by impaired function of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Because of limited LPL production or function, people with FCS cannot effectively break down chylomicrons, lipoprotein particles that are 90% triglycerides. FCS is estimated to impact up to approximately 3,000 people in the U.S. People living with FCS are at high risk of acute pancreatitis (AP) in addition to other chronic health issues such as fatigue and severe, recurrent abdominal pain. People living with FCS are sometimes unable to work, adding to the burden of disease. About the Balance Study Balance is a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of olezarsen in patients with FCS at six and 12 months. The primary endpoint was the percent change from baseline in fasting triglyceride levels at six months compared to placebo. Secondary endpoints included percent changes in triglyceride levels at 12 months, percent changes in other lipid parameters and adjudicated acute pancreatitis event rates over the treatment period. Following treatment and the end-of-trial assessments, patients were eligible to enter an open-label extension study to continue receiving olezarsen once every four weeks.

Industries Berhad (KLSE:FPI) five years ago would have delivered you a 128% gain editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sat, Dec 7, 2024, 1:01 AM 3 min read Stock pickers are generally looking for stocks that will outperform the broader market. And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. To wit, the Formosa Prosonic Industries Berhad share price has climbed 64% in five years, easily topping the market return of 8.5% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 6.0%, including dividends. Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. View our latest analysis for Formosa Prosonic Industries Berhad While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time. Over half a decade, Formosa Prosonic Industries Berhad managed to grow its earnings per share at 10% a year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 10%. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth. You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). KLSE:FPI Earnings Per Share Growth December 6th 2024 Dive deeper into Formosa Prosonic Industries Berhad's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Formosa Prosonic Industries Berhad's earnings, revenue and cash flow . What About Dividends? It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Formosa Prosonic Industries Berhad's TSR for the last 5 years was 128%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return. A Different Perspective Formosa Prosonic Industries Berhad provided a TSR of 6.0% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 18% per year for five years. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Cultural Forum shows importance of staying curious and respectful China-France Cultural Forum Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 2:35 PM 3 min read BEIJING, Nov. 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- China and France are both ancient civilizations, so we must stay curious about each other's cultures while respecting our differences, said Jean-Pierre Raffarin, former prime minister of France and president of the Foundation Prospective and Innovation (FPI), during the 6th China-France Cultural Forum held from Nov. 12 to 14 in Deauville, France.

(Photo: Li Yang/China News Service) Raffarin emphasized that while cultural divides between the two countries persist, the forum aims to bridge these gaps, fostering mutual understanding between the two peoples. This year marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and France. As important representatives of Eastern and Western civilizations, both countries have a long history of mutual appreciation and admiration. The world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century. Over the years, China and France have increased their interactions, exchange and communication in various fields, playing an exemplary role in conducting dialogue among different civilizations. From seeking common ground to mutual respect Exchanges and mutual learning between civilizations thrive on an open-minded approach that seeks common ground while respecting differences. During the opening ceremony, founder of Yishu 8 Christine Cayol shared her thoughts on the founding of the China-France Cultural Forum. She said the idea was transformed into reality thanks to the collective efforts of artists from both countries, who are dedicated to promoting exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations. So far, the forum has become a flagship event for cultural exchanges between China and France and has been incorporated into the high-level people-to-people exchange mechanism between the two countries. In 2009, Cayol founded Yishu 8, based in both Beijing and Paris, to foster cultural exchanges between French and Chinese artists. Philippe Augier, mayor of Deauville, noted that cultural openness fosters mutual understanding while cultural dialogue promotes people-to-people exchanges. Deauville, the host city for this year\u2019s forum, is known for its rich history and unique geographic location. It has frequently hosted exhibitions showcasing Chinese art, enhancing cultural understanding between the two sides. Besides, Lu Shaye, China's ambassador to France, underscored the friendly relations between Deauville and China, which is a microcosm of Sino-French cultural exchanges. Story Continues Inheritance and innovation go hand in hand The theme of this year\u2019s forum is \"Inheritance and Innovation of Civilizations: 60-year Cooperation and Development Between China and France\". At the forum, participants emphasized the importance of art innovation and people-to-people exchanges.

(Photo: Li Yang/China News Service) Ding Zhongli, president of the Western Returned Scholars Association (WRSA) and vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the theme of this year\u2019s forum highlights the precious Sino-French friendship, which should be carried forward from generation to generation. \u201cToday, we live in an internet age where many young people build their social circles online. They are impacted by emerging media,\u201d said Mao Weitao, vice chairman of the China Theatre Association and chairman of Dramatist Association of Zhejiang Province. He noted that traditional drama and theatrical arts are gradually declining. However, he pointed out that today, some young people present tradition with a fresh perspective, which is gaining popularity. Culture serves as a bridge for mutual understanding, with ancient books and emerging technologies serving as windows to our understanding of each other, said Yannick Bollor\u00e9\uff0cchairman of the supervisory board of Vivendi. The civilizations of China and France are vibrant and enduring, with cultural exchanges that never cease, he concluded.

Compost and Compostable Packaging Circularity Event PR Newswire Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 10:53 PM 6 min read FPI and U.S. Composting Council worked with companies and organization from across the compost and compostable packaging supply chains to co-create an action agenda. DENVER , Nov. 12, 2024 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ --\u00a0Companies and organizations from across the compost and compostable packaging supply chains came together in September to co-create an action agenda \u2014 from compost use and infrastructure building, to product labeling and education goals to solve circularity challenges. At the inaugural Improving the Circularity of Compostables and Compost event, a microcosm of the U.S. composting system, representing more than 130 supply chain and solid waste leaders, 110 cross-sector organizations, and 15 stakeholder groups gathered in Denver, CO for 3 days to strategize around issues to address the opportunities and challenges food-contact compostable packaging presents for compost facilities in communities around the U.S. The strategic plan and action items that emerged from the event are part of a two-year systems change effort that now moves into a broad activation phase, inviting all participants in the supply chain to become involved in the Big Ten \"Common Ground\" Initiatives, which can be found here . An Activation Steering Committee for the work going forward is being formed and leaders have already stepped up to spearhead the 10 initiative work teams. The group aligned on common ground through a facilitated three-day Future Search strategic planning process that helped the industry thoughtfully go through a process of self-examination. This included reflecting on key milestones in the history of composting and compostable packaging, examining the greatest challenges and opportunities within the current state, identifying macro and micro trends in the system, and envisioning a preferred future. Participants were able to define commonalities across a wide array of diverse experiences and resolve misunderstandings among the value chain about obstacles. One powerful moment was having each stakeholder group share what they were proud of in how they have contributed to the industry, and what they were sorry for in how their stakeholder group may have unwittingly contributed to system challenges. Built up frustrations were vocalized and a felt sense of empathy and understanding of \"being in it together\" was generated, whileeveryone had the chance to learn from past mistakes. Darla Arians from CDPHE reflects, \"One proud moment for us in the government stakeholder group was learning that our various stakeholder engagement processes have promoted cross-industry collaboration and have started to help streamline standards and processes across the compost sector.\" Story Continues Through a series of iterative and adaptive cycles of discussion and large group report outs, a collective understanding and framing helped point to the needed future. Ultimately, a slate of 17 strategic initiatives were voted upon by the entire Future Search community. Ten focus areas emerged as the immediate initiatives to pursue which had accompanying action plans with dedicated teams and leaders. This convening marked a turning point in the history of the industry in terms of the level of potential around collaboration and working together across boundaries. \"Embracing circularity transforms 'waste' into a valuable resource, closing the consumption loop is a critical requirement for success and fostering regeneration. This pivotal gathering marked a turning point for the industry, revealing an extraordinary potential for collaboration and boundary-crossing partnerships that drive sustainable progress, \" Clinton Sander , A1 Organics. A virtual report-out on the initiatives and next steps, Roadmap to Activation, is taking place November 12 , 12-1:30 ET . Anyone in the industry is welcome to attend and a replay will be available online . \"We are excited to find support across the value chain that will help us unify behind these solutions,\" said Bill Whitley , a composter and hauler from Spurt Industries & My Green Michigan. \"Having composters and producers of compostable materials understanding the issues in deep discussions and debate tremendously increases our chances for success if we can expand this work beyond the room in the coming months,\" added Kelly Williams , of Earthfirst Films. These 10 initiatives are seen by participants in the planning as the critical building blocks for a roadmap that will support the long-term success of the circularity of compost and compostables. Interested participants across the composting and compostable packaging industries are encouraged to preview the 10 priorities and sign up here to be part of the working groups developing implementation of the initiatives or on a Stakeholder Feedback team. Unique perspectives, interests, and experiences are highly valued and welcome. Stakeholders from all parts of the system are encouraged to participate in activating the Common Ground Agenda that was created, which aims to implement the initiative action plans that solve roadblocks of circularity, including contamination and acceptance in some locations. There are many ways to be involved, including being part of Stakeholder Feedback Groups, which serve to provide insights and feedback to the initiative teams on the implications of recommendations and new programs that are being developed. \"I was thrilled to see the entire composting ecosystem represented in this project and at the event, which has successfully brought key stakeholders into alignment to commit to the 10 initiatives. This is a significant milestone in the growth of our industry. I firmly believe that composting and compostables are the responsible way to mitigate the environmental impact of food waste and plastic waste. I am looking forward to seeing participation from many more in the industry,\" says Mounir Izallalen, Strategic Alliances Manager for Eastman. One unique aspect of this project is that it is guided by a collective leadership and funding model, so that ownership is ideally distributed equally for all stakeholder groups across the system. Both participation and financial support for the next stage of the process is critical so the group can fund the professional facilitation team to create structures of support for continued whole system coordination, communication, and collaboration for the 10 initiative teams. \"This project is pioneering a new whole system engagement strategy for improving the intention of circularity, and is benefitted by guidance from professional whole system change facilitators. Professional time and talent to this process need underwriting to support the facilitation team's efforts,\" Susan Thoman , CFO for the Compost Manufacturing Alliance and the interim project financial manager. A range of options on how to support this project financially can be reviewed here .
