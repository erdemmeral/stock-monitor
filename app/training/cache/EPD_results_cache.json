[{"text": "Jim Cramer on Enterprise Products Partners (EPD): \u2018My Absolute Favorite of the Group\u2019 Syeda Seirut Javed Tue, Jan 28, 2025, 1:06 PM 5 min read In This Article: EPD +1.47% We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Looked At These 7 Stocks Recently . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer recently looked at. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently shared his perspective on a few oil service stocks and the impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s pro-drilling agenda. While Trump has rolled out extensive plans aimed at boosting the oil and gas industry, Cramer said that oil service stocks might not see immediate gains as a result. \u201cThe whole oil and gas industry loves a \u2018drill, baby, drill\u2019 White House, but doesn\u2019t automatically take up the oil service stocks, or the producers for that matter. After listening to what SLB and HAL had to say over the past week, considering the macro environment and the new geopolitical factors, I think their stocks can work over time, just perhaps not necessarily right now.\u201d READ ALSO: Jim Cramer Recently Shed Light on These 9 Stocks and 8 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar Cramer further elaborated that President Trump\u2019s public statements often feel like a non-stop \u201clightning round\u201d of buys and sells. Wall Street, he said, enjoys the energy and excitement that comes with Trump\u2019s rapid-fire ideas, even if they don\u2019t always lead to actionable investment opportunities. \u201cIf you\u2019re a trader, Trump\u2019s a dream come true. He generates a huge number of catalysts every time he talks. I don\u2019t think most people should trade too hard unless you do it professionally, but this is heaven on earth for them.\u201d Cramer also pointed to historical examples, specifically drawing a comparison to President Ronald Reagan\u2019s time in office. He recalled that Reagan\u2019s vision of a 600-ship Navy led to significant profits for defense contractors. However, Cramer noted an important difference between Reagan\u2019s and Trump\u2019s approach: while Reagan\u2019s statements were more measured, Trump\u2019s style is fast-paced and unpredictable. Cramer sees this rapid-fire communication as both a challenge and an opportunity for market participants. \u201cI think we have to expect that President Trump will say something every day that gets a ton of coverage\u2026 We need to monitor these statements, but, look, we can\u2019t expect all of them to generate actionable investing ideas, even if they do produce bullish animal spirits that boost the market.\u201d Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 7 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the recent episode of Mad Money on January 23.

(EPD) a Buy Now? Zacks Equity Research Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 5:00 PM 5 min read In This Article: EPD +1.47% Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future. Shares of this provider of midstream energy services have returned +8.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Production Pipeline - MLB industry, to which Enterprise Products belongs, has gained 6.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Revisions to Earnings Estimates Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, Enterprise Products is expected to post earnings of $0.70 per share, indicating a change of -2.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.5% over the last 30 days. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.67 points to a change of +5.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.84 indicates a change of +6.3% from what Enterprise Products is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Enterprise Products. Story Continues The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: 12 Month EPS Projected Revenue Growth Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial. For Enterprise Products, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.5 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -0.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $56.51 billion and $60.78 billion estimates indicate +13.7% and +7.6% changes, respectively. Last Reported Results and Surprise History Enterprise Products reported revenues of $13.78 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.8%. EPS of $0.65 for the same period compares with $0.60 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.72 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.42%. The EPS surprise was -1.52%. Over the last four quarters, Enterprise Products surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period. Valuation Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects. Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is. The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Enterprise Products is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. Bottom Line The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Enterprise Products. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

{"text": "Expanding EPD Business Supports ABT Stock Amid Macro Issues Zacks Equity Research Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 7:33 PM 4 min read In This Article: RMD +1.85% Abbott \u2019s ABT diversified business portfolio is well-positioned to drive continued momentum in 2024. Yet, the international business environment continues to be challenging. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Factors Driving ABT Shares Abbott\u2019s Diabetes Care business continued to benefit from the growing sales of its flagship, sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring system, FreeStyle Libre. In a relatively short span, FreeStyle Libre has achieved global leadership among continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems for both Type 1 and Type 2 users. In the fourth quarter, in Diabetes Care, sales of CGM exceeded $1.8 billion and grew 23%. For full-year 2024, sales of CGM were approximately $6.5 billion and grew 22% from 2023. This included growth of 27% in the United States. Abbott continues to expand its Diagnostics business foothold (consisting of 23% of the total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2024). Over the past few quarters, the company is witnessing increased global demand for routine diagnostics (excluding COVID-19 testing sales). In the fourth quarter of 2024, rapid diagnostics, excluding COVID testing sales, increased 16% year over year. Core Laboratory Diagnostics\u2019 growth of 4% was driven by continued strong demand for Abbott\u2019s immunoassay, clinical chemistry, hematology and blood screening testing panels. Within Abbott\u2019s Established Pharmaceuticals Division (EPD) business, the company is also strategically progressing with its advancement in biosimilars. Abbott, leveraging on its leading presence in emerging markets, is enjoying a unique opportunity to scale a licensing model that is capital-efficient and can bring access to these life-changing medicines to the emerging market population. The first round of commercialization is on track for 2025. The company is highly optimistic about this initiative, considering the fact that biosimilars represent the highest growth segment in the branded generic pharmaceutical market. Abbott Laboratories Price Abbott Laboratories Price Abbott Laboratories price | Abbott Laboratories Quote Over the past three months, shares of ABT have gained 9.6% compared with the industry\u2019s 6.5% improvement. The company\u2019s consistent efforts to expand in the high-growth areas, as well as its array of new product launches are expected to help the stock to continue with its uptrend in the coming days. Concerns Remain for Abbott A challenging macroeconomic scenario in the form of the ongoing complex geo-political situation globally, specifically where Abbott operates, is driving a higher-than-anticipated increase in expenses in terms of raw materials and freight. These could also result in broader economic impacts and security concerns, affecting the company\u2019s business in the upcoming months. Industrywide, it has been seen that the deteriorating global economic environment is reducing demand for several MedTech products, resulting in lower sales and lower product prices while increasing the cost of goods and operating expenses of the businesses of the MedTech companies. In the fourth quarter, Abbott incurred an 8.5% increase in the cost of products sold (excluding amortization expense). The gross margin contracted 55 basis points to 55%. Selling, general and administration expenses were up 6.7% year over year, resulting in a 43-basis-point contraction in the adjusted operating margin. Story Continues Foreign exchange is a major headwind for Abbott due to a considerable percentage of its revenues coming from outside the United States. The strengthening of the euro and some other developed market currencies has constantly been hampering the company\u2019s performance in the international markets. In the fourth quarter of 2024, foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 1.4% on sales.

Products Partners L.P. (EPD) The Best High Dividend Stocks Under $100? Vardah Gill Sun, Jan 26, 2025, 11:54 AM 6 min read In This Article: EPD +1.47% We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best High Dividend Stocks Under $100 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) stands against the other high dividend stocks under $100. Dividend stocks hold strong appeal for income generation for two main reasons. First, their regular payouts help investors address immediate liquidity needs. Second, historical trends indicate that dividend-paying stocks can help reduce market volatility and limit losses during downturns. Companies with a track record of dividend growth often provide added stability during bearish markets. For instance, between December 31, 1999, and March 31, 2022, during periods of market decline, the High Yield Dividend Aristocrats index outperformed the Composite 1500 and the High Dividend Index, delivering an average monthly outperformance of 140 and 49 basis points, respectively. Investing in dividend stocks has always been a tug-of-war between those favoring high yields and those backing dividend growth. Analysts suggest that due to economic volatility since 2020 and ongoing market uncertainties impacting corporate earnings, high-yield companies without strong financial stability and discipline may struggle to maintain their dividend payouts. This could leave them at risk of dividend cuts or suspensions. In contrast, dividend growth strategies have proven effective in both rising and falling interest rate environments. According to a report by ProShares, the Dividend Aristocrats index, which tracks companies with at least 25 years of consistent dividend growth, achieved a 14.26% return during the period of declining interest rates from May 2005 to March 2024, outperforming high-yield stocks, which delivered just over 10%. Similarly, during periods of rising interest rates within the same timeframe, dividend growth stocks returned 10.26%, compared to 9.22% for high-yield stocks.

While analysts warn investors about the financial stability of high-yield companies, these stocks have historically delivered solid returns. The research from The Wellington study analyzed the broader market\u2019s dividend-paying stocks from 1930 to 2019, dividing them into five categories based on their dividend yields. The top 20% of dividend payers outshone the rest, with the moderate dividend group also surpassing the broader market in several periods. However, stocks with lower dividend yields showed less consistent performance compared to the broader index. Story Continues Kirsten Cabacungan, an investment strategist at Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, encouraged investors to focus on both price appreciation and dividend income when evaluating total returns. She highlighted that dividend-paying stocks bring added advantages, as their steady income can help cushion losses during market downturns, offering stability to a portfolio. Moreover, during periods of low interest rates, these stocks often provide higher income compared to options like Treasury bonds, CDs, or corporate bonds. Here are some other comments from the analyst: \u201cCompanies that have consistently increased their dividends tend to be more stable, higher quality businesses, which historically have weathered downturns and are more likely to have the ability to pay dividends consistently.\u201d Cabacungan advised that investors looking for steady income might benefit from focusing on stocks with above-average dividend yields held over the long term. On the other hand, those prioritizing growth without the need for immediate income should consider stocks with a history of steadily increasing dividends. This strategy aligns with a growth-focused approach, enabling investors to capitalize on companies that consistently enhance their dividends as their profits and cash flows expand. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best high-yield stocks under $100. Our Methodology: For this list, we first used a stock screener to identify dividend-paying stocks priced below $100 and offering dividend yields above 4% as of January 24.

Products Partners Stock a Buy Now? Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool Sun, Jan 26, 2025, 2:15 PM 6 min read In This Article: EPD +1.47% Investors interested in high-yielding dividend-paying stocks might want to give consideration to an uncommon investment option like Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) . The company is structured as a master limited partnership (MLP) , which is not taxed at the corporate level and thus passes through much of its income to investors in the form of distributions. Distributions are similar to dividends but are more favorably taxed. Typically, a large percentage of distributions are treated as a return of capital. This portion is tax-deferred, reducing an investor's cost basis in the stock, and is not taxed until the investment is sold. This also means that it is essentially taxed later at the lower capital gains tax rate and not as ordinary income. Receiving disbursements this way does involve some extra paperwork come tax time, but it is a nice benefit. From a business standpoint, Enterprise is an energy midstream company that owns a network of pipelines and other midstream assets. It transports, stores, and processes an array of hydrocarbons, including natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGLs), crude oil, and refined products. Let's look at three reasons why I think the stock is a buy right now. 1. Enterprise Products Partners has a robust and growing distribution Enterprise currently sports an attractive forward yield of 6.3%. Importantly, its distribution is well covered by its distributable cash flow (DCF), which is operating cash flow minus maintenance capex (capital expenditures). In addition, the company has a solid balance sheet with low leverage for the industry. Enterprise's distribution coverage ratio came in at a robust 1.7 times last quarter, which means that it produced DCF that was 70% higher than its distribution payouts. Meanwhile, it ended the quarter with leverage of 3 times. Midstream companies typically carry leverage from 3x to 4.5x due to the strong cash-flow nature of the industry, while Enterprise has a conservative target range between 2.75x and 3.25x. Note that Enterprise defines leverage as its net debt adjusted for equity credit in junior subordinated notes (hybrids) divided by adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Meanwhile, Enterprise has been one of the most consistent midstream companies over the years. This is evident by it raising its distribution for 26 straight years through various economic and energy cycles. The company's business is backed largely by long-term, fee-based contracts with price inflation escalators, giving it strong visibility. It said that last quarter, 88% of its natural gas contracts had a fee-based component. Story Continues I would expect Enterprise to continue to steadily increase its distributions in the years ahead.

Enterprise is moving to growth mode In addition to its consistently increasing distribution, Enterprise is also moving into more of growth phase, in part due to the opportunities it is seeing in NGL exports and power demand coming from AI. The company slowed its growth capex spending following the COVID-19 pandemic, taking it from $3 billion in 2020 down to $1.8 billion in 2021 and $1.6 billion in 2022. However, it increased it back up to $2.8 billion in 2023 and now has plans to spend $3.5 billion to $3.75 billion in 2024, and $3.5 billion to $4 billion in 2025. In the recent past, Enterprise has been getting about a 13% average return on its projects once they have fully ramped up. This means that if it spends $3.5 billion to $4 billion in growth capex, it should help boost EBITDA by $450 million to $520 million a year once projects are fully ramped. With the company projected to generate $9.85 billion in EBITDA in 2024 according to analyst estimates, that's solid growth. Enterprise currently has $6.9 billion in growth projects under construction in its backlog. Meanwhile, it has said that the power demand coming from AI is one of the best signals for increasing natural gas demand that it has seen and that it is one of the few companies with the pipeline and storage assets to really capitalize on this opportunity. It noted that it is particularly well positioned in the Dallas-Fort Worth and San Antonio areas, which are becoming data center hot spots. Natural gas demand in the U.S. is projected to see solid growth in the coming years, which will be beneficial to a company like Enterprise. Natural gas producer Antero Resources recently projected that U.S. natural gas demand could double by 2030 driven by AI, exports to Mexico, and LNG (liquefied natural gas) exports. 3. Enterprise has an attractive valuation On top of its solid, steady distribution growth and the growth opportunities in front of it, Enterprise trades at an attractive valuation from a historical perspective. The most common way to value midstream companies is using an enterprise-value-(EV)- to-EBITDA multiple, which takes into account its debt while removing the noncash costs associated with depreciation, since these costs have already been captured in its debt. On that basis, Enterprise trades at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 10 times 2024 estimates. EPD EV to EBITDA (Forward) data by YCharts Between 2011 and 2016, midstream MLPs traded at an average EV/EBITDA of 13.7 times, while Enterprise has generally traded at a premium given its consistent nature. With the stock trading at an attractive valuation and moving into growth mode, now looks like a great time to buy the stock.
