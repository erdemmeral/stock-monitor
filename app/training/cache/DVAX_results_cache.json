2025, 8:00 PM 3 min read In This Article: DVAX -0.84% Dynavax Technologies (DVAX) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices. A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years. Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements. Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Dynavax Technologies basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price. Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock. For Dynavax Technologies, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher. Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>. Story Continues Earnings Estimate Revisions for Dynavax Technologies For the fiscal year ending December 2024, this biopharmaceutical company is expected to earn $0.20 per share, which is a change of 500% from the year-ago reported number. Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Dynavax Technologies. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 19.8%. Bottom Line Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term. You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>> The upgrade of Dynavax Technologies to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.

and marketable securities were approximately $714 million as of December 31, 2024 EMERYVILLE, Calif. , Jan. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company developing and commercializing innovative vaccines, today announced preliminary, unaudited financial highlights for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2024 . (PRNewsfoto/Dynavax Technologies) \"We are excited to announce that HEPLISAV-B has achieved record annual revenue in 2024, reflecting 26% growth year-over-year, and positioning us at the upper tier of our updated guidance range. This sustained top-line growth not only underscores the strength of the HEPLISAV-B brand, but also lays a strong foundation for long-term value creation. Our robust financial position empowers us to advance our pipeline programs, maintain our focus on achieving recurring profitability, and return capital to our shareholders through an active share repurchase program,\" said Ryan Spencer , Chief Executive Officer of Dynavax. \"Looking ahead to 2025, we are committed to executing our strategic growth pillars, which are centered on maximizing the HEPLISAV-B opportunity, delivering on our clinical pipeline, and pursuing external opportunities to generate sustainable value for our shareholders.\" Business Updates and Upcoming Milestones HEPLISAV-B\u00ae [Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant), Adjuvanted] HEPLISAV-B vaccine is the first and only adult hepatitis B vaccine approved in the U.S., the European Union and Great Britain that enables series completion with only two doses in one month. Hepatitis B vaccination is universally recommended for adults aged 19-59 in the U.S. HEPLISAV-B achieved preliminary net product revenue of $268 million for the full year 2024, an increase of 26% compared to $213 million for the full year 2023. HEPLISAV-B achieved preliminary quarterly net product revenue of $71 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, an increase of 39% compared to $51 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Dynavax continues to expect the hepatitis B adult vaccine market in the U.S. to expand to a peak of over $900 million in annual sales by 2030, with HEPLISAV-B expected to achieve at least 60% total market share. Additionally, Dynavax believes the HEPLISAV-B U.S. market opportunity will remain substantial beyond 2030 due to the ongoing penetration of the unvaccinated eligible adult population, observed revaccination practices by healthcare providers, and continued gains in market share. Story Continues The preliminary selected financial results contained herein are unaudited, subject to adjustment, and provided as an estimate in advance of the Company's announcement of complete financial results, for the three and twelve months ended\u00a0December 31, 2024. Clinical Pipeline Dynavax is advancing a pipeline of differentiated product candidates that leverage its CpG 1018 \u00ae adjuvant, which has demonstrated its ability to enhance the immune response with a favorable tolerability profile in a wide range of clinical trials and real-world commercial use. HEPLISAV-B for Adults on Hemodialysis: Dynavax\u00a0is developing a four-dose HEPLISAV-B\u00ae vaccine regimen for adults on hemodialysis. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Dynavax received feedback from the FDA regarding the potential to conduct an observational retrospective cohort study to support its sBLA filing for adults on hemodialysis. Shingles vaccine program: Z-1018 is an investigational vaccine candidate being developed for the prevention of shingles in adults aged 50 years and older. Dynavax is currently conducting a randomized, active-controlled, dose escalation, multicenter Phase 1/2 trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of Z-1018 compared to Shingrix\u00ae in 441 healthy adults aged 50 to 69. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company completed enrollment in the trial, and Dynavax anticipates reporting top line immunogenicity and safety data in the third quarter of 2025. Plague vaccine program: Dynavax is developing a plague (rF1V) vaccine candidate adjuvanted with CpG 1018\u00ae in collaboration with, and fully funded by, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). Based on the results from a randomized, active-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of the plague vaccine adjuvanted with CpG 1018, Dynavax and the DoD executed a new agreement for approximately $30 million through the first half of 2027 to support additional Phase 2 clinical and manufacturing activities. WHAT IS HEPLISAV-B? HEPLISAV-B is a shot given to adults 18 years of age and older to help prevent infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. HEPLISAV-B is usually given in the arm muscle. HEPLISAV-B is given in 2 doses, 1 month apart, by a healthcare provider. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION If you have a history of severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of any hepatitis B vaccine, or to any ingredient of HEPLISAV-B, including yeast, do not take HEPLISAV-B. HEPLISAV-B must be given by a medical professional, who will monitor you afterwards, to check for allergic reaction. If you are immunocompromised, or receiving immunosuppressant therapy, you may have less of an immune response to HEPLISAV-B. Some people have hepatitis B infection without being aware of it or showing any symptoms. If you already have hepatitis B present in your body, HEPLISAV-B may not prevent hepatitis B infection. The most common side effects include pain at the injection site, tiredness, and headache. HEPLISAV-B was not studied in pregnant or nursing women. Tell your provider if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant or are breast feeding. Vaccination with HEPLISAV-B may not protect all individuals. Talk to your healthcare provider to determine if HEPLISAV-B is right for you.

Stock Options Zacks Equity Research Fri, Jan 3, 2025, 4:30 PM 2 min read In This Article: DVAX -0.84% Investors in Dynavax Technologies Corporation DVAX need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 17, 2025 $3 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. What is Implied Volatility? Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy. What do the Analysts Think? Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Dynavax Technologies shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Dynavax Technologies is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry that ranks in the Top 27% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has moved from 2 cents per share to 4 cents in that period. Given the way analysts feel about Dynavax Technologies right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected. Looking to Trade Options?

Ryan Spencer -- Chief Executive Officer and Director Thanks, Paul, and thank you all for joining us this afternoon. It's nice to be here again to share the results of another very successful quarter for Dynavax. Our success continues to be driven by HEPLISAV-B, where the team once again delivered a record quarter with $79 million in net product sales. We are very proud of our accomplishments with HEPLISAV-B from its development to successful commercialization. While the quarterly result is impressive, we are still at the beginning of our plan for continued growth, which Donn will provide some more details on in a moment. Our commercial success with HEPLISAV-B has transformed Dynavax into a profitable company. Supported by our confidence in the future growth of HEPLISAV-B and expectations for our current programs, we are committed to continuing this trend in the future. Pipeline discipline and thoughtful capital allocation are cornerstones to our approach to generate long-term value. This quarter, we read out our phase 1 extension study from our Tdap program. And while our phase 1 study showed improved immunogenicity from our vaccine candidate, the results did not demonstrate sufficient differentiation to meet our threshold to support advancement. Accordingly, we took the decision to discontinue this program. We continue to believe there is a need for an improved pertussis vaccine. However, we also understand what it takes to be commercially viable in a competitive environment. We will continue to evaluate all of our clinical and preclinical programs to ensure we invest in product candidates that offer meaningful value for both patients and shareholders alike. Moving to our Z-1018 shingles vaccine program. We are actively enrolling in our phase 1/2 trial, and we expect enrollment to complete by the end of this year with top-line data in the second half of 2025. Rob will review our expectations from this study later on in the call. At our core, we are a company driven by strategic execution and operational excellence. In recognition of our strength and capabilities, we remain committed to our corporate development strategy, focusing on the expansion of our portfolio with assets that can be rapidly developed into commercial products. We have evaluated many targets and hold ourselves to a very high bar when it comes to deploying capital toward external opportunities. We will continue to maintain discipline and patience, as we execute on this part of our strategy. Now, as I said earlier, we are excited to have achieved a very meaningful milestone for companies in our industry, where we expect near-term recurring profitability from our base business. Our capital allocation strategy balances financial discipline with our ambition to leverage our expertise and capabilities to drive growth. As announced in today's press release, our board of directors has authorized a $200 million share repurchase plan. Personally, having been at Dynavax for so long and having participated in and led a number of financing transactions, it is a proud moment to be in a position where we can return capital to our shareholders while continuing to execute on our long-term vision for the company. We aspire to be a leader in vaccines and infectious diseases with commercial scale and scientific expertise. I'm proud of how we've driven and managed our growth to date. I'm inspired by the work that we have ahead and more confident than ever in the potential of our future. We have an exceptional, dedicated, and energized team focused on developing and commercializing products that change the public health landscape and protect millions from infectious diseases. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Donn. Donn Casale -- Chief Commercial Officer Thank you, Ryan. We are very proud of the performance and record-breaking sales for HEPLISAV-B in the third quarter. HEPLISAV-B achieved over $79 million in net product revenue, supported by hepatitis B market growth and increases in HEPLISAV-B market share. HEPLISAV-B continues to increase its total U.S. market share year over year, achieving 44% market share in the third quarter compared to 41% during the same period last year. HEPLISAV-B's growth continues to be driven by two critical segments, retail pharmacy and integrated delivery networks or IDNs. HEPLISAV-B's market share in the Retail Pharmacy segment increased to 55% compared to 53% for the third quarter of 2023. For IDN, HEPLISAV-B's estimated market share increased to 56% compared to 54% during the same period last year. Over the past year, within retail pharmacy and IDNs, the U.S. hepatitis B market dose volume grew 23% year over year in Q3, while HEPLISAV-B dose volume grew 27%. These trends support our long-term growth expectations of the hepatitis B market and uptake of the ACIP universal recommendation. In the fourth quarter, we look for continued focus by retail pharmacy and IDN customers on hepatitis B vaccination, with increases in HEPLISAV-B U.S. market share. We also anticipate typical year-end seasonality with market contraction of approximately 15% due to fewer patient visits during the holiday season. Looking ahead, we are confident in the long-term revenue opportunity for HEPLISAV-B. We expect the HEPLISAV-B market opportunity in the U.S. to expand to a peak of over $900 million by 2030, with HEPLISAV-B achieving at least 60% total market share. This long-term guidance represents our expectation of double-digit annual growth for product net sales for HEPLISAV-B out to 2030. In addition, we expect the HEPLISAV-B market opportunity to remain durable beyond 2030, due to ongoing vaccination of the eligible adult population, observed vaccination practices by healthcare providers, and continued gains in market share. In summary, we remain confident in the outlook for HEPLISAV-B. We expect HEPLISAV-B to strengthen its position as the clear market share leader in the expanding hepatitis B vaccine market. We are very proud of our commercial team's success and are excited about our work to build on this momentum for the remainder of this year and into the future. I will now turn the call over to Rob to take you through our clinical pipeline. Rob Janssen -- Chief Medical Officer Thank you, Donn. Beginning with regulatory updates for HEPLISAV-B. The FDA recently approved our sBLA to include pregnancy information in the U.S. label for HEPLISAV-B. We previously reported that FDA issued a complete response letter for the sBLA that adds a four-dose regimen for patients on hemodialysis to the U.S. label. Dynavax recently received feedback from the FDA regarding the potential to conduct an observational retrospective cohort study to address the deficiencies noted in the complete response letter. We look forward to providing future updates on these discussions. Now turning to our shingles vaccine program, Z-1018. As a reminder, we believe there's an opportunity to develop an improved shingles vaccine given the challenging tolerability profile of the current market-leading product. In the second quarter, we initiated a randomized active-controlled dose escalation multicenter phase 1/2 trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of Z-1018 compared to Shingrix. We plan to enroll approximately 440 healthy adults aged 50 to 69 years. And with recognition that CD4-positive T-cells are important in preventing reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, we seek to demonstrate CD4-positive T-cell responses that are similar to those of Shingrix. We'd like to see our median T-cell responses greater than 75% of Shingrix responses, which we believe would suggest a high probability of non-inferiority. Now important additional information we'll consider, though, will be the distribution and quality of T-cell responses and T-cell responses over time. Antibody responses, including vaccine response rates will also be evaluated. In addition to immunogenicity measures, the phase 1/2 trial will also be used to validate a patient-reported outcome measurement tool to differentiate Z-1018 on tolerability and to support potential label claims. We anticipate reporting top-line immunogenicity and safety data in the second half of 2025. Finally, our plague vaccine program is in collaboration with and funded by the U.S. Department of Defense. Based on the results from a randomized active-controlled phase 2 clinical trial of the two-dose plague vaccine adjuvanted with CpG 1018, Dynavax has submitted a proposal to the Department of Defense regarding additional clinical and manufacturing activities. I'll now turn the call over to Kelly to review our financial results. Kelly MacDonald -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Rob. Before I get started, a reminder to please refer to our press release and Form 10-Q filed earlier today for more detailed financial information. The third quarter financials were underscored by record HEPLISAV-B net sales of $79 million and positions us to deliver on a narrowed guidance range of $265 million to $270 million in HEPLISAV net sales for 2024, representing over 25% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of this range. This top-line growth highlights the strength of our commercial team and successful marketing campaigns across multiple channels, including retail. Additionally, HEPLISAV-B gross margin improved to 84% in Q3 and 82% for the first nine months of the year, slightly outpacing our reiterated guidance of approximately 80% for the full year. Turning to our expenses. R&D expenses for the quarter were $14 million and reflect important progress throughout our pipeline, as Rob mentioned moments ago. SG&A expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $43 million compared to approximately $38 million for the prior-year period. The increase was primarily driven by incremental headcount supporting our organization, coupled with marketing investments driving the growth of HEPLISAV-B during the quarter. These results generated quarterly net income of $18 million, supporting our commitment to achieve profitability and positive net income for the full year 2024. Moving to the balance sheet. We exited the third quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of approximately $764 million, which was a $28 million increase during Q3. As Ryan mentioned, we believe that the strength of our current financial profile, including our balance sheet, supports the development of our pipeline assets toward proof of concept and enables us to actively pursue external opportunities to expand our portfolio with strategically aligned assets that can be rapidly developed into commercial products. In addition to these stated priorities, we are committed to returning capital to shareholders while still maintaining strict focus on executing on our organic and inorganic growth. As noted today, our board has approved a $200 million share repurchase plan, and we believe this use of capital will benefit our shareholders while also preserving financial flexibility to make the investments required to deliver on our vision for the company. Lastly, we have updated our full year 2024 financial guidance, which includes a narrower HEPLISAV-B net product revenue guidance of approximately $265 million to $270 million, a reiteration of our expectations of HEPLISAV-B gross margin of approximately 80% for the year, and an overall tightening of expense guidance for the year. We now expect research and development expenses to be between $55 million to $65 million and selling, general, and administrative expenses to be between $170 million to $180 million. Lastly, we are expecting to achieve a full year of profitability and positive net income for 2024. For our full guidance framework, please consult our press release from today. In closing, we're excited to report another strong quarter, consisting of record quarterly revenue for HEPLISAV-B, improved product gross margins and advancing pipeline and a strong financial profile with a balanced capital allocation strategy. We are proud of this progress, and we're also excited about our growth prospects as outlined on the call today. Thank you everyone. Operator, we would now like to open the Q&A portion of today's call. Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. At this time, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Phipps with William Blair. Your line is open. Matt Phipps -- Analyst Good afternoon, team. Thank you for all this extra kind of clarity and nuance guidance here today on the market. Looking at this updated kind of 2030 view, I was wondering, if your 2027 previous view still is intact as far as $800 million total market by 2027, then further expanding to $900 million by 2030? Or if you think it's a little bit more linear straight to 2030, just given, I guess, now you see kind of an 8% CAGR between 2023 and 2030 versus previously an 11% CAGR between 2023 and 2027 just my first question. Ryan Spencer -- Chief Executive Officer and Director Matt, thank you. I'll take that quickly. Yeah, we just see this as an extending of our of our guidance out to 2030 and where we see peak. And this is not a reiteration to change what we thought would happen by 2027. Matt Phipps -- Analyst OK. Thanks, Ryan. And then it looks like the majority of growth between 2027 and 2030 is almost exclusively coming from the retail channel comparing kind of the percentage of market by segment. Is that true? And if so, what do you think is -- is IDN capping out at some point? Or what's driving your confidence in retail really driving that much more growth? Ryan Spencer -- Chief Executive Officer and Director Donn, do you want to take that? Donn Casale -- Chief Commercial Officer Yeah, sure. Matt, yes, as we have communicated, we believe the retail pharmacy segment is well primed to continue to realize growth from ACI universal, partly due to the fact that the infrastructure that they've built coming out of the pandemic the fact that there is quite a bit of incentive for retail pharmacy to identify and recommend around all adult vaccines. And we continue to see the shift from the traditional hospital IDN segment, if you will, to retail, not only for HEPLISAV-B, but obviously, as we've seen in other vaccines as well, the shift into retail pharmacy. So, we do see retail pharmacy being the predominant driver of that growth in those outer years relative to IDN. Matt Phipps -- Analyst OK. And then last question for me. Just as you're thinking about this 60% market share goal, you're already pretty close there in kind of your target segments, and it's been kind of stable throughout 2024. So, is getting to 60% more about kind of a spillover in the non-field target segments? Or do you expect to be meaningfully above 60% in those field target segments? Thank you for taking my questions. Ryan Spencer -- Chief Executive Officer and Director Sure, Matt. Donn, do you want to take that one, too? Donn Casale -- Chief Commercial Officer Sure. Yeah. So, Matt, again, retail pharmacy and IDN will be the predominant growth drivers over this time period. We continue to expect taking market share within those critical segments. And so the disproportionate growth within IDN and retail will continue to increase the overall total market share. We do see some spillover in some of these other segments as we continue to increase awareness around HEPLISAV-B over the years. But again, this market share gain will continue to be driven off these critical segments of retail pharmacy and IDN where we do see, as I said before, disproportionate growth and continued increases in market share. Operator Thank you. Please stand by for the next question. The next question comes from Jon Miller with Evercore. Your line is open. Jon Miller -- Analyst Hi, guys. Congrats on the quarter, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe on gross margin dynamics, can you give me a little more color about how you expect gross margin to evolve maybe just over the next couple of quarters, given you reiterated the full year guidance, but it seems like you're a little bit ahead of schedule this quarter. Is there still some variability to expect in gross margin going forward into Q4? Ryan Spencer -- Chief Executive Officer and Director Kelly, do you want to handle that one? Thanks for the question, Jon. Kelly MacDonald -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. Thanks, Jon. Yes, sure. So, while we look toward the full year to represent the continued progress around gross margin, there are sort of fluctuations quarter over quarter as you've seen over the last couple of years just in terms of accounting and timing of recognizing cost of goods sold relative to the activities, particularly in our Germany facility. So, we're not trying to highlight anything specifically that we're anticipating. We just acknowledge that there's some variability from quarter to quarter. Jon Miller -- Analyst All right. Great. And I guess, secondly, I heard you reiterate your interest in BD and external opportunities. But I guess, given a pretty substantial share repo authorization here, should we be taking that as more a priority than external BD? And is that a sign that you've had trouble finding good value in the external opportunities that are out there right now? Ryan Spencer -- Chief Executive Officer and Director No, I wouldn't read into it that way. I think the reality is it's a balanced capital allocation strategy, and we feel like we have the opportunity to return capital at these levels while still maintaining our focus for growth through external business and corporate development. Obviously, the opportunity set, we've been prioritized and working through it and they continue -- it's dynamic. It's not static. And we do believe there's still good opportunities out there. And to the extent things are larger and require more support, we would have to obviously figure out how to finance that. But ultimately, it doesn't change our focus on how we're going to drive growth. Jon Miller -- Analyst And then maybe just lastly on that repo for modeling purposes, do you have an expectation for cadence on the repo and when that could happen? Or do you have -- or is it fully open-ended? Paul Cox -- Vice President, Investor Realtions and Corporate Communications Kelly? Kelly MacDonald -- Chief Financial Officer We have stated that we intend to execute the program within the next 12 months, subject to market conditions, and we look forward to leveraging the program to execute accordingly. Jon Miller -- Analyst All right. Thanks very much. Ryan Spencer -- Chief Executive Officer and Director Thanks. Operator Thank you. Please stand by for the next question. The next question comes from the line of Ernie Rodriguez with TD Cowen. Your line is now open. Ernie Rodriguez -- Analyst Hi, team. Congrats on the quarter and thank you for taking our questions. So, looking forward to Q4 and Q1 and thinking about the expected seasonality, we were wondering if the lower rate of RSV vaccination that has been reported by the RSV players in part due to the CDC updated regs, could that be a positive impact on HEPLISAV and maybe represent some upside given the potential for more capacity in the retail segment? Is that something you're thinking about? Ryan Spencer -- Chief Executive Officer and Director Thanks, Ernie. Don, why don't you address that one? Donn Casale -- Chief Commercial Officer Ernie, yes, thanks for the question. Not necessarily upside. We considered certainly the recommendation when we thought about the guide. It certainly represents, again, opportunity from the standpoint of a plus-one campaign for HEPLISAV-B. It's an open arm, if you will, as people into the pharmacy for other vaccines. That is the retail pharmacy strategy. All the retailers always want to find a way to have a plus one vaccine. So, from that standpoint, there's opportunity, but we calculated that into kind of our thinking into the fourth quarter, as well as starting into the beginning of 2025. Ernie Rodriguez -- Analyst Thank you. That's helpful. And then on the pipeline and the Tdap vaccine program, is there any learnings from those results that perhaps are any read-through to the other vaccine programs, or maybe even any potential vaccine indication that you are contemplating? Any learnings from that, any data that you can use going forward? Ryan Spencer -- Chief Executive Officer and Director No. I mean, I think -- well, there's no negative read-through from one program to the other. I think the learning is every program, every antigen, every disease is different, and the product that you're building and how 1018 will support it's going to be different. So, no, there's no consistent read-through that we would look to get out of that information. I think the important thing that you can extrapolate is how we manage our clinical pipeline and our investments in R&D to hold ourselves accountable to try to find ways to have meaningful readouts that will allow us to make decisions, and then make the decision around that information with a focus of building products that will actually be competitive and so we can have a high confidence in the product's overall success. So, I think that's probably the bigger learning from this, Ernie. But no, I wouldn't suggest there's any read-through for 1018 here. This is just how 1018 performed with these specific antigens against this specific target. Ernie Rodriguez -- Analyst Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. Ryan Spencer -- Chief Executive Officer and Director Thank you. Operator Thank you. Please stand by for the next question. The next question comes from the line of Paul Choi with Goldman Sachs. Paul, your line is now open. Paul Cox -- Analyst Hi, thank you. Good afternoon team, and thank you for taking our questions. I had a pipeline question for Rob with regard to 1018. And the question is, how do you think about the possibility of a single-dose candidate here that's reasonably within the non-inferiority margin versus Shingrix on immunogenicity even if there is somewhat more higher rate of adverse events relative to maybe a wider dosing interval with multiple doses with two doses. Thank you very much. Ryan Spencer -- Chief Executive Officer and Director Go ahead, Rob. Rob Janssen -- Chief Medical Officer Yeah. A single dose, I think, is going to be challenging. I think it's going to be challenging for everybody. With respect to reactogenicity, we're seeing fine reactogenicity even with our higher dose of CpG 1018, even with that higher reactogenicity than with the lower dose of 1018, it's still better than Shingrix and still better tolerated than Shingrix. I think we're certainly going to be looking -- as we look at this wider interval, we certainly are going to be looking at the dose to see if there's a potential opportunity. But in the previous study, we compared one dose of the Z-1018 with one dose of Shingrix, and they were the same. It was the second dose, in which things seem to improve more for Shingrix than it did for us. It improved very well for both vaccines, but more for Shingrix. So, we're going to look at one dose. I'm not sure we're going to see one dose success. Ryan Spencer -- Chief Executive Officer and Director And Paul, if I understood your question, it sounded like you were asking, would it be worth -- if a product could generate dose immunogenicity or efficacy but had to trade off with even higher reactogenicity, would that make sense? Because I think we've seen that in some other programs, not ours. And I think we would have to say, from our perspective, Shingrix is one of the most reactogenic vaccines or is probably the most reactogenic vaccine. So, I think anything that targets a profile that has more reactogenicity is not likely to be very successful. Paul Cox -- Analyst Got it. OK. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Please stand by for the next question. The next question comes from the line of Roy Buchanan with Citizens. Your line is now open. Roy Buchanan -- Analyst Thanks for taking the question. I had a few on the site program and the plan you submitted to DoD. I see that dose optimization in the slides. Anything you can say about the doses that you're going to look at higher, lower? Do you still expect greater durability and a lower number of doses? And when do you expect to hear back from the DoD on that? Ryan Spencer -- Chief Executive Officer and Director Hey, Roy, thanks for the question. I think the best thing for us to do is hold off commenting on specifics regarding the trial until we actually have heard back from DoD on the contract and have alignment on what the next clinical trial would look like. So, we do expect to hear back from the DOT in the near term, possibly this year, early next year. But again, it's kind of up to them. So, we're happy that we were able to continue the relationship with them and submit this updated contract, and we'll be able to provide you with more information when they respond. Roy Buchanan -- Analyst OK. Perfect. And then the sBLA for the dialysis label for HEPLISAV, I guess do you have any sense of how long you might need to compile that data? And Rob, I think, you provided future updates on the discussions. So, are discussions ongoing, you're waiting for additional feedback? Or do you think you know what you need to do at this point? Ryan Spencer -- Chief Executive Officer and Director Yes. I'll take that. Rob, you can add on. But we've engaged with them in the process as part of their response. And so we are waiting to provide an update to them in the near term. And then once they have that, there's no defined timeline for their response. There's not a PDUFA timeline or anything like that. So, this is a little bit more flexible as far as how the dialogue will go. So, Rob, do you want to provide any additional comments? Rob Janssen -- Chief Medical Officer Yes. So, we're proposing a real-world evidence study. And Ryan said we have to go through steps. And the first one is they have to decide if the database is fit for purpose. So, that's really the step we're going to engage with them in the near term. I think in the long term, Roy, our understanding of the amount of time it will take to do the analysis is even though FDA's timelines are not guided by PDUFA, we're still optimistic we'll be able to get our resubmission on time by mid-May next year. Roy Buchanan -- Analyst OK. Thank you. Operator Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Ryan Spencer, CEO for closing remarks. You may begin. Ryan Spencer -- Chief Executive Officer and Director Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Dynavax. We're excited about our recent accomplishments and the strength of our position. We look forward to updating you on our progress focused on protecting the world against infectious diseases. Operator, you may end the call.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $69.51 million. The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters.

{"text": "Dynavax Technologies (DVAX) Upgraded to Buy: Here's Why Zacks Equity Research Mon, Nov 11, 2024, 8:00 PM 3 min read In This Article: DVAX -0.84% Investors might want to bet on Dynavax Technologies (DVAX), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices. The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system. Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Dynavax Technologies is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price. Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock. For Dynavax Technologies, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher. Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>. Story Continues Earnings Estimate Revisions for Dynavax Technologies For the fiscal year ending December 2024, this biopharmaceutical company is expected to earn $0.18 per share, which is a change of 460% from the year-ago reported number. Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Dynavax Technologies. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 8.2%. Bottom Line Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term. You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>> The upgrade of Dynavax Technologies to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.

Zacks Equity Research Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 5:55 PM 4 min read In This Article: DVAX -0.84% Shares of Dynavax Technologies (DVAX) have gained 7.2% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $12.66, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $24.50 indicates a potential upside of 93.5%. The mean estimate comprises four short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $6.61. While the lowest estimate of $15 indicates an 18.5% increase from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 129.1% to reach $29. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts. While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. But, for DVAX, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside. Here's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price Targets According to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading. While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why? They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts. However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces. Story Continues That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism. Why DVAX Could Witness a Solid Upside There has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. For the current year, three estimates have moved higher over the last 30 days compared to no negative revision. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 18.4%. Moreover, DVAX currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much DVAX could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.

Zacks Equity Research Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 5:03 PM 2 min read In This Article: DVAX -0.84% Investors in Dynavax Technologies Corporation DVAX need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 17, 2025 $03.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. What is Implied Volatility? Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy. What do the Analysts Think? Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Dynavax Technologies shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Dynavax Technologies is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Medical \u2013 Biomedical and Genetics industry that ranks in the Top 26% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased his estimate for the current quarter, while one has revised their estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from two cents per share to four cents in the same time period. Given the way analysts feel about Dynavax Technologies right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected. Looking to Trade Options?

{"text": "Wall Street Analysts Predict an 88.32% Upside in Dynavax Technologies (DVAX): Here's What You Should Know Zacks Equity Research Mon, Nov 11, 2024, 5:55 PM 4 min read In This Article: DVAX -0.84% Dynavax Technologies (DVAX) closed the last trading session at $13.01, gaining 24.7% over the past four weeks, but there could be plenty of upside left in the stock if short-term price targets set by Wall Street analysts are any guide. The mean price target of $24.50 indicates an 88.3% upside potential. The average comprises four short-term price targets ranging from a low of $15 to a high of $29, with a standard deviation of $6.61. While the lowest estimate indicates an increase of 15.3% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 122.9% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts. While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in DVAX. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside. Here's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price Targets According to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading. While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why? They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts. However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces. Story Continues That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism. Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in DVAX Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 8.2%, as two estimates have moved higher compared to no negative revision. Moreover, DVAX currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much DVAX could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.

-1.28% We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Small-Cap Stocks Ready To Explode . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Dynavax Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:DVAX) stands against the other small-cap stocks. Prospects For Extended Outperformance Of Small-Cap Stocks On October 7, Chuck Royce, founder and Senior Advisor, and Francis Gannon, Co-Chief Investment Officer and Managing Director of Royce Investment, discussed the outperformance of small-cap stocks. While discussing the reasons that led to the Russell 2000 Index doing well in Q3 '24, Gannon noted that the strong performance of the Russell 2000 Index, which was up 9.3%, in the third quarter of 2024 can be attributed to a \"quintessential reversion to the mean,\" as small-caps had lagged behind larger companies for an extended period. He thinks that the rebound was not surprising given the historical trends, as the small-cap index outperformed the large-cap Russell 1000, up 6.1%, and the mega-cap Russell Top 50, up 4.2% during this time.

On the other hand, Royce mentioned that he was surprised by the concentration of the small-cap gains. He noted that all the gains for the quarter were compressed at the start, as by early July 16, the index had already achieved a 10.6% increase from the end of June, marking its high for the quarter. Royce further mentioned that this rapid ascent was followed by a notable decline, with the index dropping 10.1% from July 16 to August 7 before recovering most of its losses by the end of September. Despite this volatility, he expressed satisfaction with the small-cap performance overall for the quarter, especially since it marked a reversal after small-caps last outperformed large-caps in Q4 2023. Building further upon the volatility of small-cap stocks, Royce expressed that while volatility in small-cap stocks can be concerning, it is a normal part of investing in this asset class. He emphasized that they welcome volatility as it allows them to take advantage of price fluctuations for long-term gains. Historically, significant intra-year declines are common for small-caps, with the Russell 2000 experiencing double-digit pullbacks in 22 out of the last 25 years. While answering how the sector can sustain its market leadership performance, Gannon highlighted that market breadth among large caps often leads to better performance for small caps. He pointed out that when the equal-weighted Russell 1000 outperformed its capitalization-weighted counterpart, small-caps typically led in performance. This trend suggests that an expansion of returns across different sectors is a positive indicator for small-cap stocks. Story Continues Moreover, both Royce and Gannon stressed that earnings growth is crucial for the long-term success of small-cap stocks. Gannon stated that while short-term market psychology can influence stock prices, consistent earnings are fundamental for sustaining long-term performance. He noted that despite a significant portion of small-cap companies lacking earnings, around 44.6%, those with earnings are expected to grow faster than their large-cap counterparts in 2025. Our Methodology To curate the list of 10 best small-cap stocks ready to explode we used the Finviz stock screener and CNN.

revenue of $79.3 million , representing 27% year-over-year growth Hepatitis B adult vaccine market expected to expand to a peak of over $900 million by 2030, with HEPLISAV-B expected to achieve at least 60% estimated total market share Expect positive net income in 2024, achieving full year profitability Strengthened cash position to $764 million in Q3'24 $ 200 million share repurchase program announced as part of balanced capital allocation strategy Conference call today at 4:30 p.m. ET / 1:30 p.m. PT EMERYVILLE, Calif. , Nov. 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company developing and commercializing innovative vaccines, today reported financial results and provided a business update for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 . (PRNewsfoto/Dynavax Technologies) \"We are confident that the continued top-line growth of HEPLISAV-B sets the foundation for durable, long-term value creation. We believe our commercial execution to date, overall financial position, and our commitment to achieving profitability, afford us the capacity to return cash to shareholders through the share repurchase program announced today. We will continue to execute on our strategic growth pillars focused on maximizing the HEPLISAV-B opportunity, delivering on our clinical pipeline, and pursuing external opportunities to drive sustainable value for our shareholders,\" said Ryan Spencer , Chief Executive Officer of Dynavax. \"Additionally, we have decided to discontinue development of our Tdap-1018 program based on results from the Phase 1 extension study. The program showed improved immunogenicity driven by CpG 1018, however, we do not believe the data support sufficient differentiation to be successful commercially. This decision aligns with our commitment to prudent management of resources aimed at generating long-term value.\" BUSINESS UPDATES HEPLISAV-B\u00ae [Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant), Adjuvanted] HEPLISAV-B vaccine is the first and only adult hepatitis B vaccine approved in the U.S., the European Union and Great Britain that enables series completion with only two doses in one month. Hepatitis B vaccination is universally recommended for adults aged 19-59 in the U.S. HEPLISAV-B achieved record quarterly net product revenue of $79.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 27% compared to $62.3 million for the third quarter of 2023. HEPLISAV-B total estimated market share in the U.S. increased to approximately 44%, compared to approximately 41% for the third quarter 2023. HEPLISAV-B estimated market share in the retail pharmacy segment increased to approximately 55%, compared to approximately 53% for the third quarter of 2023. HEPLISAV-B estimated market share in the Integrated Delivery Networks (IDNs) and Large Clinics segment was approximately 56%, compared to approximately 54% for the third quarter of 2023. Dynavax now expects the hepatitis B adult vaccine market in the U.S. to expand to a peak of over $900 million in annual sales by 2030, with HEPLISAV-B expected to achieve at least 60% total market share. Additionally, Dynavax believes the HEPLISAV-B U.S. market opportunity will remain substantial beyond 2030 due to the ongoing penetration of the unvaccinated eligible adult population, observed revaccination practices by healthcare providers, and continued gains in market share. Story Continues Clinical Pipeline Dynavax is advancing a pipeline of differentiated product candidates that leverage its CpG 1018 \u00ae adjuvant, which has demonstrated its ability to enhance the immune response with a favorable tolerability profile in a wide range of clinical trials and real-world commercial use. HEPLISAV-B Regulatory Updates In the third quarter, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved\u00a0the Company's supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to include pregnancy information from HBV-28, a post-licensure observational retrospective cohort study, in the U.S. label for HEPLISAV-B. The HBV-28 study showed no increased risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in women who received HEPLISAV-B compared to an active comparator. Regarding the Complete Response Letter issued for the sBLA to include a four-dose HEPLISAV-B vaccine regimen for adults on hemodialysis on the U.S. label, Dynavax recently received feedback from the FDA regarding the potential to conduct an observational retrospective cohort study to support the sBLA filing. Shingles vaccine program: Z-1018 is an investigational vaccine candidate being developed for the prevention of shingles in adults aged 50 years and older. Dynavax is currently conducting a randomized, active-controlled, dose escalation, multicenter Phase 1/2 trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of Z-1018 compared to Shingrix\u00ae in approximately 440 healthy adults aged 50 to 69. Dynavax\u00a0anticipates reporting top line immunogenicity and safety data in the second half of 2025, including a comparison of CD4+ T-cells. Plague vaccine program: Dynavax is developing a plague (rF1V) vaccine candidate adjuvanted with CpG 1018\u00ae currently in a Phase 2 clinical trial in collaboration with, and fully funded by, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). Based on the results from a randomized, active-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of the two-dose plague vaccine adjuvanted with CpG 1018, Dynavax has submitted a proposal to the DoD regarding additional clinical and manufacturing activities. Tdap vaccine program: Tdap-1018 was an investigational vaccine candidate intended for active booster immunization against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap). Dynavax announced today that it has decided to discontinue development of its Tdap-1018 program based on results from a long-term Phase 1 extension study that did not demonstrate a differentiated profile that the Company believes would be successful commercially. THIRD QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Total Revenues and Net Product Revenue. Total revenues for the third quarter of 2024 were $80.6 million , a 16% year-over-year increase compared to $69.5 million for the third quarter of 2023.

R&D expenses for the third quarter of 2024 increased to $14.4 million , compared to $14.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by costs related to the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the shingles program, partially offset by the completion of clinical trial activities for the Tdap and plague programs. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses (SG&A). SG&A expenses for the third quarter of 2024 increased to $43.1 million , compared to $38.1 million for the third quarter of 2023.

HEPLISAV-B is a shot given to adults 18 years of age and older to help prevent infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. HEPLISAV-B is usually given in the arm muscle. HEPLISAV-B is given in 2 doses, 1 month apart, by a healthcare provider. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION If you have a history of severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of any hepatitis B vaccine, or to any ingredient of HEPLISAV-B, including yeast, do not take HEPLISAV-B. HEPLISAV-B must be given by a medical professional, who will monitor you afterwards, to check for allergic reaction. If you are immunocompromised, or receiving immunosuppressant therapy, you may have less of an immune response to HEPLISAV-B. Some people have hepatitis B infection without being aware of it or showing any symptoms. If you already have hepatitis B present in your body, HEPLISAV-B may not prevent hepatitis B infection. The most common side effects include pain at the injection site, tiredness, and headache. HEPLISAV-B was not studied in pregnant or nursing women. Tell your provider if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant or are breast feeding. Vaccination with HEPLISAV-B may not protect all individuals. Talk to your healthcare provider to determine if HEPLISAV-B is right for you.

Release Date: November 07, 2024 For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript . Positive Points Dynavax Technologies Corp ( NASDAQ:DVAX ) reported record net product sales of $79 million for Hep B in the third quarter. The company achieved a 44% market share in the US for Hep B, up from 41% in the same period last year. Dynavax Technologies Corp ( NASDAQ:DVAX ) has authorized a $200 million share repurchase plan, indicating strong financial health. The company expects to achieve full-year profitability and positive net income for 2024. Dynavax Technologies Corp ( NASDAQ:DVAX ) is actively enrolling in a Phase 12 trial for its shingles vaccine program, with top-line data expected in the second half of 2025. Negative Points The Phase 1 extension study for the TAP program did not meet the threshold for advancement, leading to its discontinuation. The company anticipates a typical year-end market contraction of approximately 15% due to fewer patient visits during the holiday season. Dynavax Technologies Corp ( NASDAQ:DVAX ) received a complete response letter from the FDA for the SBLA that adds a four-dose regimen for patients on hemodialysis. There is uncertainty regarding the timeline for FDA feedback on the proposed observational retrospective cohort study. The company faces challenges in developing a single-dose shingles vaccine candidate that meets non-inferiority margins compared to Shingrix. Q & A Highlights Q : With the updated 2030 market view, does the previous 2027 view of an $800 million total market still hold, or is it more linear growth to 2030? A : Ryan Spencer, CEO: We see this as an extension of our guidance to 2030, not a change to our 2027 expectations. Q : Is the majority of growth between 2027 and 2030 coming from the retail channel, and what drives confidence in retail growth? A : Donn Casale, Chief Commercial Officer: Retail pharmacy is expected to drive growth due to infrastructure built post-pandemic and incentives for recommending adult vaccines. We see a shift from traditional hospital segments to retail. Story Continues Q : How do you expect gross margin to evolve over the next quarters, given the full-year guidance? A : Kelly MacDonald, CFO: While we expect continued progress in gross margin, there may be quarterly fluctuations due to accounting and timing of recognizing costs, particularly in our Germany facility. Q : Does the $200 million share repurchase plan indicate a priority over external business development? A : Ryan Spencer, CEO: The share repurchase is part of a balanced capital allocation strategy. We remain focused on growth through external opportunities and believe there are still good opportunities available. Q : Could the lower RSV vaccination rates impact Helia positively due to more capacity in the retail segment? A : Donn Casale, Chief Commercial Officer: While there's opportunity for a plus-one campaign for Hep B, we have factored this into our guidance for Q4 and early 2025. Q : Are there any learnings from the T A vaccine program that could apply to other vaccine programs? A : Ryan Spencer, CEO: There's no negative read-through from one program to another. Each program is different, and we focus on building competitive products with high confidence in success. Q : How do you view the possibility of a single-dose shingles vaccine candidate being non-inferior to Shingrix? A : Robert Janssen, Chief Medical Officer: A single dose is challenging due to reactogenicity. We will evaluate one dose, but success is uncertain. Higher reactogenicity than Shingrix is unlikely to be successful. Q : Can you provide details on the plague vaccine program and expected feedback from the Department of Defense? A : Ryan Spencer, CEO: We are awaiting feedback from the Department of Defense on the contract and expect to hear back possibly this year or early next year.

Technologies Corporation Just Recorded A 9.1% EPS Beat: Here's What Analysts Are Forecasting Next editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sun, Nov 10, 2024, 5:01 PM 3 min read In This Article: DVAX -0.84% Shareholders of Dynavax Technologies Corporation ( NASDAQ:DVAX ) will be pleased this week, given that the stock price is up 10% to US$13.01 following its latest third-quarter results. Results look mixed - while revenue fell marginally short of analyst estimates at US$81m, statutory earnings beat expectations 9.1%, with Dynavax Technologies reporting profits of US$0.12 per share. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year. View our latest analysis for Dynavax Technologies NasdaqGS:DVAX Earnings and Revenue Growth November 10th 2024 Taking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from Dynavax Technologies' five analysts is for revenues of US$336.8m in 2025. This reflects a substantial 29% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to jump 150% to US$0.39. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$338.2m and earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.35 in 2025. Although the revenue estimates have not really changed, we can see there's been a substantial gain in earnings per share expectations, suggesting that the analysts have become more bullish after the latest result. The consensus price target fell 5.1% to US$24.60, suggesting the increase in earnings forecasts was not enough to offset other the analysts concerns. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. The most optimistic Dynavax Technologies analyst has a price target of US$29.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$15.00. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure. Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. We would highlight that Dynavax Technologies' revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 23% annualised growth rate until the end of 2025 being well below the historical 28% p.a. growth over the last five years. Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 21% annually. So it's pretty clear that, while Dynavax Technologies' revenue growth is expected to slow, it's expected to grow roughly in line with the industry. Story Continues The Bottom Line The most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards Dynavax Technologies following these results. They also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, with the company predicted to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry. The consensus price target fell measurably, with the analysts seemingly not reassured by the latest results, leading to a lower estimate of Dynavax Technologies' future valuation. With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Dynavax Technologies. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits.
