(ALIT) Now? Talha Qureshi Sat, Jan 18, 2025, 8:14 PM 5 min read In This Article: ALIT -3.65% We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Software Stocks to Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alight, Inc. (NYSE:ALIT) stands against the other software stocks. Software Industry Update According to the MCF Corporate Finance Q4 2024 software update report, software company valuations have reached unprecedented heights due to the AI boom, especially with innovations surrounding GenAI. Investors are increasingly viewing strong AI roadmaps as essential for revenue and margin expansion, leading to heightened interest in software companies that integrate advanced AI capabilities into their offerings. According to the report, software companies are trading at 6.2x the Current median EV / NTM revenue estimate. As highlighted by the report, another key reason for increased valuations has been the high adoption rate of GenAI. The enterprise-level usage of GenAI almost doubled year-over-year in 2024 and around 65% of the enterprises now use the technology. The report noted that organizations have now transitioned from the pilot testing phase to full-scale GenAI implementations, enhancing workflows and customer experiences while unlocking new revenue streams. Moreover, the investment and funding for GenAI-based software companies also increased sharply. According to the report GenAI raised around $56 billion in funding in 2024, driven by a $10 billion round of DataBricks, a $6.6 billion round by OpenAI, and a $4 billion round of Anthropic. Not only this, GenAI also claimed more than 40% of the total AI funding across the United States, Europe, and Israel. Talking about how AI has started to play in the favor of software, Jeff Richards, managing partner at Notable Capital appeared on a CNBC interview a month ago. He noted that AI is actively working for the software sector, indicating that the technology is not just a prospect but is already being utilized effectively in various applications within the industry. Richards highlighted that the development of AI which started with semiconductor chips, then moved to data centers and servers is now in the software development stage where software application companies are in high demand to integrate AI applications in various industries. Similar to the findings by the MCF corporate finance report, Richards also highlighted that venture capital funds have been heavily funding software startups for the past two to three years to ensure the effective application of GenAI, which we are witnessing right now.

Polen US Small Company Growth Strategy during its Q3 2024 investors letter decided to exit its positions from Alight, Inc. (NYSE:ALIT) stating they were not satisfied with the company's plan and the new standalone business. However, management remains optimistic regarding the future of the company mainly on the back of improved profitability during the fiscal third quarter and new partnerships signed during the quarter. Although the quarterly revenue decreased slightly by 0.4% year-over-year to $555 million due to lower volumes and project revenues, as well as the winding down of certain business operations. On the bright side, the gross profit margins improved from 29.8% in the previous year to 31.4% during the current year. In terms of new partnerships, Alight, Inc.

(NYSE:ALIT) in its Q3 2024 investor letter : \u201cWe exited four positions during the quarter, including SiTime, AppFolio, RH, Doximity, and Alight, Inc. (NYSE:ALIT). Our position in Alight, a benefits outsourcing, and business process-as-a-service company, was an unsuccessful investment. We decided to move on due to activist pressure that led to a breakup of the business. We were dissatisfied with both the plan and the new standalone business. This culminated with the CEO leaving and uncertainty over the company\u2019s long-term strategic direction. As a result, we felt it was time to move on with better investment ideas in our pipeline.\u201d Overall ALIT ranks 9th on our list of the best software stocks to buy according to analysts.

"Is Alight, Inc. (ALIT) the Best Single Digit Stock to Buy Now? Ashar Jawad Sat, Jan 11, 2025, 1:09 AM 6 min read In This Article: ALIT -3.65% We recently published a list of 10 Best Single Digit Stocks To Buy Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alight, Inc. (NYSE:ALIT) stands against other best single digit stocks to buy now. The US markets had a blockbuster 2024, led by a strong show by the technology sector. The broader market grew by over 23% during the year after rising 24% in 2023. Two consecutive years of over 20% gains marked the market\u2019s best performance in nearly three decades. READ ALSO: 12 Best Long-Term Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds and 10 Best Penny Stocks to Buy for 2025 . Stocks have benefited from a resilient American economy that steered clear of recession. Waning inflation and interest rate cuts also bolstered investor sentiment throughout last year. Research analysts anticipate continued growth in 2025 amid strong economic data and anticipation of a business-friendly Trump administration. In a note on December 30, Wedbush Securities analyst, Dan Ives, said that he expects tech stocks to surge 25% this year with the incoming Trump administration focusing on slashing unnecessary regulations. Todd Rosenbluth, the head of research at VettaFi, believes 2025 could be the year for small-cap stocks with solid underlying fundamentals. He expects ETFs specializing in small-caps to make gains as investors broaden their market exposure as interest rates ease. Rosenbluth shared the following remarks while talking to CNBC in late November. \u201cSmall caps are going to become more in favor in 2025. They started to perk up since the election and heading into the election as interest rates have been coming down.\u201d Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee also shares similar sentiments. In an interview in November, he said that small-cap stocks could soar in the coming years under the new administration, driving monster returns. \u201cI do think there\u2019s still a lot of upside. So I think small-caps could, over the next couple of years, outperform by more than 100%.\u201d On the other hand, some Wall Street analysts are cautious about the new year and have warned of potential downsides, with the incoming administration promising new tariffs. Following his election victory, President-elect Trump vowed to impose steep tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, which could increase costs for manufacturers. Ongoing geopolitical tensions in different parts of the world could also hurt the stock market. Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro for Fidelity Management & Research Company wrote the following in a note on December 18. \u201cPersonally, I am bullish on stocks for 2025, though with valuations high and the bull market maturing, I don\u2019t think investors should expect quite such spectacular returns next year as we have seen this past year. And I think there are important risks from inflation, and the market\u2019s concentration, to be aware of.\u201d Story Continues Methodology For this article, we sifted through screeners to get a list of stocks priced greater than $1 and less than $10, with a low forward price-earnings ratio (<15) and institutional ownership of over 70%. From there, we selected the 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, based on Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 900 prominent hedge funds as of Q3 2024. The 10 best single digit stocks to buy now have been ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them. Where two or more stocks were tied on hedge fund sentiment, we used a higher market cap as a tiebreaker between them. Please note that all data is as of the close of day on Friday, December 27, 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(ALIT) the Best Low Priced Technology Stock to Buy Now? Ali Ahmed Mon, Dec 30, 2024, 10:21 PM 6 min read In This Article: ALIT -3.65% We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Low Priced Technology Stocks To Buy Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alight Inc. (NYSE:ALIT) stands against the other low-priced technology stocks. The Rising Significance of Technology: Is Now the Time to Invest? The technology sector plays a crucial role in the modern economy, encompassing a wide range of industries. This sector can include businesses involved in electronics, software, artificial intelligence (AI), and information technology, among others. As companies increasingly rely on technological innovations to enhance productivity and efficiency, the technology sector is poised for growth as it becomes essential for both consumers and businesses. Recent trends indicate a significant shift towards AI, cloud computing, and cybersecurity as key drivers of growth. Enterprise spending in these areas is expected to increase, driving growth in the global tech market. Generative AI is becoming more important than ever as a vital tool for many organizations, marking a significant shift from experimentation to practical application. According to the latest McKinsey Global Survey on AI, conducted in the first half of 2024, 65% of respondents indicated that their companies are now regularly utilizing generative AI, nearly double the figure from just ten months prior. This surge in adoption reflects a growing belief in the technology\u2019s potential, with 75% of respondents anticipating that generative AI will bring about substantial changes in their industries in the coming years. The overall adoption of AI has also seen a notable increase, rising from around 50% to 72% over the past year. Technology-oriented stocks are set to achieve another impressive year by the end of 2024, according to U.S. Bank Asset Management. As of mid-December, the S&P 500 Communication Services and Information Technology index has risen over 40% year-to-date, following a remarkable 57% increase in 2023. Although technology stock performance slowed down in the third quarter of 2024, it regained momentum in the fourth quarter. According to Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director for U.S. Bank Asset Management, corporate investments in artificial intelligence (AI) applications continue to drive this growth, even though the pace of AI spending eased slightly in the third quarter. Investors are attracted to the tech sector because of its innovative nature. Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist with U.S. Bank Asset Management, emphasizes that technology is crucial for improving speed and efficiency across various industries. While the sector can experience short-term fluctuations, Sandven remains confident about its long-term prospects, as companies seek growth through technology rather than simply hiring more staff. Haworth shares this optimism, noting that technology stocks are central to current economic expansion and benefit significantly from business capital investments. However, he notes that investors still need to be careful in their approach to this sector. While some tech startups achieve great success, others may fail to get off the ground.

(ALIT) Among the Best Low Priced Stocks to Invest in Now? Mashaid Ahmed Sat, Dec 28, 2024, 5:48 PM 6 min read In This Article: ^GSPC -0.76% ^RUT -1.28% ALIT -3.65% We recently published a list of the 10 Best Low Priced Stocks to Invest in Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alight, Inc. (NYSE:ALIT) stands against the other best low priced stocks to invest in now. According to a report by Charles Schwab published on December 9, the U.S. economy and stock market are entering 2025 from a position of relative strength, but the risks of volatility, particularly those related to policy, are significantly higher compared to the previous year. This uncertainty is largely driven by the policy proposals of President-elect Donald Trump, whose unconventional governing style and fluid policy positions have made forecasting their impact on domestic and global conditions extremely challenging. The report highlights that Trump's policy proposals, which include lower taxes and reduced regulations, are generally seen as growth-positive. However, these are offset by proposals for higher tariffs on imported goods and mass deportations of illegal immigrants, which are generally considered stagflationary, at least in the short term. In terms of the stock market, the report suggests that while equities can perform well from the beginning to the end of the year, the volatility is likely to be higher in 2025 compared to 2024. The S&P 500 is currently above its 50 and 200-day moving averages, which historically has been a positive indicator for future performance. However, the report cautions that after a year with 57 record highs, the median gain in the following year has historically been around 5.8%, suggesting a potential for a step back in performance. The report also notes that the S&P 500's 5-year normalized P/E ratio is quite stretched, indicating a product of market enthusiasm but not necessarily a near-term risk. For small caps, the report notes that the Russell 2000 has struggled in the current bull market due to higher interest rates and weaker profit profiles. The report suggests that profitable small caps could perform well if economic growth holds and the Fed takes a gradual approach to rate cuts, but the index as a whole might continue to face challenges if earnings growth does not improve.

U.S. Stocks in 2025: Growth, Risks, and Opportunities In an interview with Bloomberg on December 24, Jonathan D. Corpina, Senior Managing Partner at Meridian Equity Partners, discussed his outlook for U.S. stocks in 2025. Corpina noted that the market is finishing the year strong, supported by a resilient economy and key events such as the election and rate cuts being out of the way. He believes that the market will continue to move higher in 2025, though it will take a few quarters for the new administration to implement new policies and procedures. Story Continues Corpina also addressed investor expectations for strong double-digit earnings growth for S&P 500 companies, suggesting that while the bar is set high, it's important to manage expectations. He emphasized that the economy remains fragile, and companies are still adjusting to the new environment and administration. He advised a cautious approach, noting that there are many uncertainties that could impact the market in the coming year. On the U.S. financial sector, Corpina is optimistic. He anticipates a lot of M&A activity and IPOs in 2025, driven by a pro-business administration. While the U.S. economy and stock market are entering 2025 with a foundation of relative strength, the landscape remains fraught with uncertainty.

(ALIT) a Favorite Stock for Billionaire David Einhorn? Neha Gupta Thu, Dec 19, 2024, 11:45 AM 6 min read In This Article: ALIT -3.65% GLRE -1.41% We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire David Einhorn . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alight Inc. (NYSE:ALIT) stands against the other best stocks to buy according to Billionaire David Einhorn. The markets are broken and getting worse. That\u2019s the stance held by billionaire investor David Einhorn, who insists we are in a secular destruction of the professional asset management community. The sentiments come against one of the longest bull runs that have resulted in valuations in the equity markets getting out of hand. While the S&P 500 is at record highs after a 30% plus gain year to date, Einhorn views the markets as fundamentally broken. Passive investors with no opinion or concern about value have been the main drivers pushing the market higher while shunning underlying fundamentals. According to Einhorn, passive investors increasingly buy into market indexes by default, propping growth stocks at the expense of value stocks. READ ALSO: Billionaire Daniel Sundheim\u2019s Top 15 Stock Picks Heading Into 2025 and Billionaire David Tepper\u2019s Top 10 Stock Picks Heading into 2025 . Likewise, the billionaire hedge fund manager laments that value investors are increasingly marginalized. \u201cAnd so effectively instead of the valuation becoming the signal, the valuation people were just noise and everybody else is sort of the signal. And this is why I think we have a structurally dysfunctional market, a bit of a broken market, and essentially a perpetual erosion of value as a strategy, as you would,\u201d Einhorn said in an interview with CNBC. The sentiments underline the growing concerns that value stocks are becoming increasingly cheaper and cheaper relative to their underlying fundamentals. That\u2019s in part because investors are turning their attention to indexes and growth stocks, resulting in overstretched valuations. Increased focus on growth stocks at the expense of value stocks has resulted in one of the most expensive stock markets in decades. Amid the premium valuations, David Einhorn insists there is still some value to unlock by focusing on value stocks trading at discounted valuations. By focusing on value investments, Einhorn has generated strong long-term returns through Greenlight Capital , the hedge fund he founded in 1996 with $900,000 from family and friends. Likewise, Greenlight Capital rose to prominence at the height of the financial crisis, as Einhorn sensed a window of opportunity to generate some returns by shorting the stock of Lehman brothers. Similarly, it was on the news in 2002 as it shorted Allied Capital, a transaction that was validated in 2002 by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Story Continues Since 1996, Greenlight Capital has averaged 13.1% in annual returns compared to 9.5% gains for the S&P 500. The outperformance comes from Einhorn emphasizing the balancing of long- and short-term exposure in investments. Likewise, he advocates monitoring industry risks and obtaining insurance against foreseeable macro threats. Additionally, stock picking has always been essential as one of Einhorn's key investment strategies of integrating considerable picture awareness into successful portfolio management strategies. Diversification as one of the ways of spreading risks is also Einhorn\u2019s key investment strategies. \u201cHaving my eyes open to the big picture doesn\u2019t mean abandoning stock picking, but it does mean managing the long-short exposure ratio more actively, worrying about what may be brewing in certain industries, and, when appropriate, buying some just-in-case insurance for foreseeable macro risks even if they are hard to time,\u201d Einhorn said.

Polen U.S. Small Company Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Alight, Inc. (NYSE:ALIT) in its Q3 2024 investor letter : \u201cWe exited four positions during the quarter, including SiTime, AppFolio, RH, Doximity, and Alight, Inc. (NYSE:ALIT). Our position in Alight, a benefits outsourcing and business process-as-a-service company, was an unsuccessful investment. We decided to move on due to activist pressure that led to a breakup of the business. We were dissatisfied with both the plan and the new standalone business. This culminated with the CEO leaving and uncertainty over the company\u2019s long-term strategic direction. As a result, we felt it was time to move on with better investment ideas in our pipeline.\u201d Overall, ALIT ranks 8th on our list of best stocks to buy according to Billionaire David Einhorn.

{"text": "Alight (ALIT) Upgraded to Buy: Here's What You Should Know Zacks Equity Research Fri, Nov 22, 2024, 8:00 PM 3 min read In This Article: ALIT -3.65% Alight, Inc. (ALIT) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices. A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years. Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements. As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Alight is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price. Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock. For Alight, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher. Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>. Story Continues Earnings Estimate Revisions for Alight For the fiscal year ending December 2024, this company is expected to earn $0.59 per share, which is a change of -16.9% from the year-ago reported number. Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Alight. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 10.7%. Bottom Line Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term. You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>> The upgrade of Alight to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.

(ALIT) Misses Q3 Earnings Estimates Zacks Equity Research Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 5:00 PM 3 min read In This Article: ALIT -3.65% Alight, Inc. (ALIT) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.09 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.11 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.14 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -18.18%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $0.12 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.11, delivering a surprise of -8.33%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. Alight , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Software industry, posted revenues of $555 million for the quarter ended September 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.98%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $813 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Alight shares have lost about 12.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 25.8%. What's Next for Alight? While Alight has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Alight: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
