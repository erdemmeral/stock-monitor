All signs of an irritated, itchy dog. With approximately 17 million U.S. dogs suffering from allergic skin disease, including atopic dermatitis, food allergies or flea sensitivity, i,ii these are the sounds too many pet parents and veterinarians hear. Today, Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (NYSE: ELAN), is introducing some of the first allergic dogs who have found zen and gotten back to normal by using Zenrelia. Zenrelia, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and launched in September 2024 , is a highly effective, convenient and safe once-daily oral JAK inhibitor for control of pruritus (itching) associated with allergic dermatitis and control of atopic dermatitis in dogs at least 12 months of age. Experience the full interactive Multichannel News Release here: https://www.multivu.com/elanco/9235451-en-elanco-zenrelia-canine-dermatology \"Our research shows that when pet owners see their dog at their worst levels of itch, they're concerned, stressed, frustrated and anxious, iii \" said Bobby\u00a0Modi, Executive Vice President, U.S. Pet Health and Global Digital Transformation. \"Pet owners shouldn't allow allergic itch to disrupt zen for them or their pups. Zenrelia is designed to begin working from the very first dose iv and help get dogs back to normal.\" v In fact, a newly published study in a leading peer-reviewed, international journal, Veterinary Dermatology, described the findings of a randomized, clinical trial which compared Zenrelia to the leading JAK inhibitor, Apoquel, in over 300 allergic dogs. The full study findings can be found at: https://doi.org/10.1111/vde.13319 . The Zenrelia label includes a boxed warning related to concurrent vaccine administration based on the results of a vaccine response study. It's important for veterinarians to read the entire package insert, including the Boxed Warning, before prescribing Zenrelia. Meet Some of the Faces of Zen According to a survey of pet owners, itchy dog owners are eager to get back to a normal life with their dogs, with 82% agreeing they dream of the day their itchy dog becomes normal again and they understand that effective treatment is part of that solution. ii With Zenrelia now widely available, Zenrelia has expanded beyond the clinical trial to helping dogs across the country\u2014and their pet owners\u2014find zen. These real-world results give hope to millions of pet parents whose pets suffer from itch. Story continues Hunter from Ohio , found his zen with Zenrelia. This eight-year-old Chocolate lab suffered with dermatitis most of his life and as he got older, his symptoms\u2014especially licking at his feet and lower legs got worse. His pet parent, Cristy, a receptionist at a vet clinic, tried everything her veterinarian had recommended to bring Hunter relief. Hunter had an extensive regimen of injections every 3-4 weeks, medicated shampoos and wipes, antihistamines, and during parts of the year when he was worse, he was on steroids. Even with this intensive routine his symptoms were never fully controlled\u2014until Hunter took Zenrelia. \"His back feet were pretty much naked up until his first joint and his front feet would be scabby and scaly from the constant licking,\" Cristy said. \"It was really discouraging as his dog mom that I couldn't do anything to help him. He's so much more comfortable since being on Zenrelia. It's such a relief that he has relief.\" According to Cristy, \"It's worth talking to your veterinarian to see if it's something that your dog would benefit from.\" Individual results may vary and dogs should be up to date on vaccinations prior to starting Zenrelia. Trooper , a four-year-old Yorkshire Terrier, from Arizona , first got back to normal levels of itch when he participated in the Zenrelia clinical trial. When the trial concluded, the itch returned. His owner, Robin, was excited to get him back on the treatment now that Zenrelia is widely available. \"Allergies are something he's going to have to suffer with his whole life,\" said Trooper's pet parent, Robin. \"Having a solution for his allergies is such a relief. It makes my heart happy that I will be able to afford it and give him the relief he deserves.\" Lisa, pet mom to 9-year-old Yorkshire Terrier-Chihuahua mix Scrappy said she \"tried everything under the sun\" to help bring Scrappy relief. Scrappy's itching reached the point he lost a significant amount of fur, he didn't want to play or go on walks and no one was getting a good night's rest. Lisa tried numerous treatment options and felt depleted knowing his itch was never fully controlled, until she tried Zenrelia. After two days on Zenrelia, his itch level improved and after eight weeks on Zenrelia, Lisa is happy and relieved to see Scrappy back to a normal dog. According to Lisa, his hair has re-grown, he's taking long walks and he's a happy boy. \"I was excited to get Trooper, Scrappy and some other patients started on Zenrelia as soon as it was available to order,\" said Dr. Tom Lewis , veterinary dermatologist and founder of Dermatology for Animals, a group of veterinary dermatology clinics committed to caring for pets with allergies. \"Seeing these dogs get back to normal levels of itch and seeing the bond restored between the dog and pet parents is incredibly rewarding. Pet owners should contact their veterinarian and ask if Zenrelia is right for their dog.\" Buckaroo, an eight-year-old mixed breed from Texas , tried numerous treatment options without relief, including steroids and immunotherapy\u2013until his veterinarian recommended Zenrelia. The photos show Buckaroo's skin before Zenrelia, after three weeks of treatment, and after eight weeks of treatment. His owner noted, \"he's now the happiest boy in the world and his energy levels have increased dramatically.\" \"I've had the opportunity to use Zenrelia in my practice and it's helped several of my patients get back to normal levels of itch,\" said Dr. Brittany Lancellotti , a veterinary dermatologist at Veterinary Skin and Ear in Los Angeles , California.\u00a0\"In the fight against allergic dermatitis, I've found that every dog is different - it's great to have another effective treatment option in my toolbox.\" \"I work with dermatologists around the country through the American College of Veterinary Dermatology,\" said Dr. Andrew Rosenberg , dermatologist, and director of medical operations at Animal Dermatology Clinic in New York and President of the American College of Veterinary Dermatology (ACVD). \"It' great to have another tool in the toolbox especially for both new and severe cases.\" Veterinarians in the U.S. can learn more and place orders for Zenrelia now at ZenreliaForVets.com .

pyrantel chewable tablets) Provides Broadest[i] Parasite Protection of Its Kind PR Newswire Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 4:27 PM 6 min read In This Article: ELAN -2.58% Six-in-One Parasite Protection in One Chewable Tablet Six of Six Potential Blockbusters from Elanco Now In-Market GREENFIELD, Ind. , Jan. 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (NYSE: ELAN) today announced Credelio Quattro\u2122 (lotilaner, moxidectin, praziquantel, and pyrantel chewable tablets) is now available for veterinarians to order at CredelioQuattroVet.com . With four established and powerful ingredients, Credelio Quattro is designed to deliver the broadest i parasite protection of its\u00a0kind. Credelio Quattro is the first and only monthly chewable tablet of its kind\u00a0to protect against six different types of parasites, including three risky intestinal worms that can be passed to humans: Tapeworms Roundworms Hookworms ii Heartworms Ticks Fleas \"Today is a historic day as we bring veterinarians and pet owners peace of mind with the broadest i parasite protection of its kind for dogs,\" said Bobby Modi , Executive Vice President, U.S. Pet Health and Global Digital Transformation. \"Our research shows 94% of dog owners believe that proactive treatment for intestinal worms, including tapeworms, is a top priority. And when looking for intestinal worm protection for their dog, owners care most about product effectiveness, parasite coverage and duration of protection. By providing the broadest i range of parasite protection of its kind, covering six parasites in a single, chewable, Credelio Quattro delivers on pet owner expectations, while strengthening Elanco's market presence and positioning us for continued growth in the parasiticide segment.\" But the survey shows an important gap where pet owners need to lean in to better protect their beloved pets against risky parasites. Just one in three respondents believe that fleas and ticks are a risk year-round; and only half of dog owners surveyed protect against heartworm disease year-round. iii With the geographic spread of parasites and increasing disease pressure, the importance of year-round protection is more significant than ever. Broad. Fast. Tasty. Tough. The broad range of parasite protection from Credelio Quattro in a single, chewable monthly tablet makes it easy for pet parents to protect against some of the most common and challenging parasites. According to studies, Credelio Quattro has been shown to be 100% efficacious against tapeworms with its industry-established dose of praziquantel (one of the active ingredients found in Credelio Quattro). iv Credelio Quattro also contains lotilaner that kills ticks v twice as fast vi as sarolaner in Simparica Trio \u00ae and afoxolaner in NexGard\u00ae. vii Story Continues \"Parasites like tapeworms, fleas and ticks can carry dangerous diseases and some of these can spread from dogs to humans,\" said Dr. Casey Locklear , veterinarian and parasiticide lead for Elanco Animal Health. \"The Companion Animal Parasite Council (CAPC) recommends year round prevention of parasites, even during the winter months and specifically mentions the need for monthly deworming of dogs with praziquantel in areas where a certain type of tapeworm \u2013 E. granulosus tapeworms \u2013 are endemic.\" viii Veterinarians can place their orders today at CredelioQuattroVet.com . Credelio Quattro will make its debut at the Veterinary Meeting & Expo (VMX) in Orlando from January 25-29, 2025 . Attendees can visit Booth #4617 to place their orders, learn more and speak with experts on-site.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Andy Harmening, President and CEO, for opening remarks. Please go ahead, sir. Andrew Harmening We continue to see signs of strength in the US economy and closer to home in the Midwest, the situation has remained remarkably stable. Unemployment rates in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and several other Midwestern states remained well below the national average of 4.1%. Our prime and super prime consumer borrowers have remained resilient, and our commercial customers are cautiously optimistic about their growth prospects in 2025. This continued stability has enabled us to remain front-footed with the execution of our growth strategy. And the fourth quarter was an active one for our company. We added to our commercial capabilities through the launch of a new specialty deposit and payment solutions vertical. We raised over $300 million of new capital through a common stock issuance and put a portion of that capital to work through a balance sheet repositioning, selling approximately $700 million in low-yielding mortgage loans and $1.3 billion in AFS securities. We also purchased $55 million in existing customer credit customer credit card balances through an expansion of our participation agreement with Elan Financial Services. During the quarter, we also announced the addition of two widely respected business leaders to our Board of Directors and Kristen Ludgate and Owen Sullivan. We elevated three senior business line leaders to our executive leadership team and the Head of Corporate and Commercial Banking, Phil Trier; Deputy Head of Commercial Real Estate, Greg Warsek; and Deputy Head of Consumer and Business Banking, Steve Zandpour, and we welcomed several high-quality RMs to our growing commercial team. Importantly, we also delivered strong financial results during the quarter as we've continued to benefit from our organic growth strategies. Here in Q4, we delivered adjusted loan growth of over $500 million and core customer deposit growth of nearly $900 million, while maintaining stability and discipline with regards to credit risk. As we look forward to 2025, we are positioned to play offense and we're entering the year with a consumer value proposition that stacks up with anyone in the industry. A growing customer -- a growing customer household base with deepened relationships, strong and improving customer satisfaction results and expanding commercial team with deep expertise and capabilities and an enhanced profitability profile from the balance sheet repositioning we announced in December. Taken together, these actions have positioned associated for strong performance in '25 and beyond. With that, I'd like to walk through some additional financial highlights from the quarter and 2024 as a whole, beginning on slide 2. Our fourth quarter results were impacted by nonrecurring items tied to the balance sheet repositioning we announced in December. After excluding these nonrecurring items, the emerging momentum of our core businesses was reflected through adjusted earnings per share of $0.57. Core customer deposits grew by nearly $900 million during the quarter, and on the other side of the balance sheet, we grew total loans by over $500 million after adjusting for the mortgage loan sale announced in December. Over $300 million of that growth came in our commercial and business lending segments. An emerging growth story within our commercial business is starting to take hold. We've said all along that our intention is to fund the majority of our loan growth with core customer deposits. And in 2024, we did just that. For the year, we grew core customer deposits by $1.2 billion or 4.3% and adjusted loans by $1.3 billion or 4.4%. This will remain a point of emphasis for us in 2025. Shifting to the income statement. Our net interest income increased $8 million from Q3 and finished at $270 million our margin increased 3 basis points to 2.81%. Due to the timing of our balance sheet repositioning, we expect to realize most of the margin benefit from the transaction here in Q1 of 2025. Our GAAP noninterest income was impacted by nonrecurring items tied to our balance sheet repositioning during Q4. But on an adjusted basis, we saw a $5 million quarterly increase. Total adjusted noninterest expense finished at $210 million for the quarter. And while we've continued to make strategic investments in support of our growth plan, staying disciplined on expenses remains a foundational focus of our company. Another foundational focus is managing credit risk. Here in Q4, our nonaccrual loans, charge-offs and provision all decreased versus the prior quarter and the same period last year. In 2025, we remain committed to staying ahead of the curve by taking a disciplined, consistent approach to loan risk ratings so that we can better understand credit risk in our portfolio by both segment and geography. On slide 3, we provided a detailed breakdown of EPS impact from several nonrecurring items impacted our financial results in Q4. First, the balance sheet repositioning we announced during the quarter impacted our income statement through a $130 million loss from the sale of mortgages and another $148 million net loss on the security sale we completed. Combined, these items reduced noninterest income by $279 million. Second, our total noninterest expense was impacted by a $14 million loss on prepayment of FHLB advances tied to the repositioning. And finally, our provision increased slightly due to the net impact of a release from the sale of mortgage loans and a build from the credit card balances we purchased during the quarter. Net of tax, our adjusted EPS came in at a positive $0.57 for the quarter. This adjusted number underscores the strength of our core businesses and gives us confidence that we're on the right path with our strategic plan as we move into 2025. Shifting to slide 4. We've made significant progress as a company since I joined in 2021. And thanks to several tailwinds that have started to emerge, I'm more confident than ever that we're on the right track first. we've made several key leadership hires over the course of the past 12 to 24 months, and those hires are having an impact. This includes the three recent executive leadership team members added in Q4 and but it also includes Jayne Hladio who stepped into her role as President of our Private Wealth business in late '23. In the short time she's been here, we've already seen more new relationships, increased referrals and higher sales activity for retirement plans and other services. Second, we now have a consumer value proposition that can compete with just about anyone in the industry, which has better equipped us to deepen relationships with existing customers and attract new ones. The results can be seen in our record high customer satisfaction scores, positive household growth trends and improved quality of those households. Given current market dynamics, we've tweaked our net household growth expectations for 2025 and but we continue to be encouraged by the momentum we've seen to date. Third, we've continued to make progress on our efforts to diversify our consumer loan portfolio without abandoning our conservative approach to credit. By getting out of TPO lending, shifting to an originate-to-sell model and reposition our balance sheet we've reduced our resi loan concentration from a high of 36% of total loans before I got here to 24% of total loans as of year-end, which has provided capacity to grow in more profitable lending categories. And finally, commercial banking is a central component of our growth strategy. We've added 21 of 26 planned hires and expect to have hiring fully completed by the end of Q1. As mentioned previously, we expect the balance sheet impact of these new hires to increase throughout 2025 as the new RMs across our footprint settle in and build their respective pipelines. On slide 5, we highlight our loan trends through the quarter. After excluding mortgage loans sold as part of the balance sheet repositioning, total loans increased by $501 million in Q4. This growth was led once again by C&I, which grew by over $300 million in Q4. We also saw $157 million in CRE investor growth during the quarter, which was largely driven by the completion of construction projects in Q4. While we continue to expect elevated payoff activity in the coming quarters, payoffs were limited in the fourth quarter. As we continue diversifying our consumer portfolio, we saw auto finance balances grow by $101 million here in Q4 and other consumer categories grew by $69 million. The latter was largely driven by the $55 million in credit card balances we purchased during the quarter. On slide 6, we show loan trends on an annual basis. And since 2020, the trend has been clear. we've decreased our reliance on low-yielding noncustomer residential mortgage loans and diversified into higher-return categories all while growing our total loan portfolio by over 20% and maintaining our conservative approach to credit. More recently, total loans grew by $552 million from year-end '23 to year-end '24. This growth has been highlighted by emerging traction in our commercial business, particularly in the back half of '24. After growing C&I loans, $230 million in the first half of the year, we grew by over $600 million in the back half of the year as the RMs we've hired are steadily accelerating their production. We have clear momentum in the commercial space. we have the leaders in place. Our hiring is largely complete and pipelines continue to build. As such, we expect C&I loan growth of $1.2 billion in 2025. More broadly, we continue to seek selective growth that emphasizes full banking relationships, quality credit profiles and diversification to deliver improved returns. With this in mind, we expect total bank loan growth of 5% to 6% for the year. Moving to slide 7. We had mentioned back that some expected customer deposit growth to pick up in the back half of the year, and that trend largely played out as we expected. Through adding over $600 million in core customer deposits in Q3, we added nearly $900 million here in Q4. Unlike Q3, which saw heavy CD inflows, growth in Q4 was driven primarily by interest-bearing demand, money market and savings categories. The inflow of core customer deposits during the quarter once again enabled us to work down our wholesale funding reliance. Total wholesale funding sources were down 3% in Q4. On slide 8, we show deposits on an annual basis. We've consistently grown our average annual deposits as our balance sheet has expanded over the years and the impact of our efforts to grow core customer deposits have emerged more clearly in 2024. On a spot basis, core customer deposits grew by $1.2 billion or 4.3% versus 2023. As we look to 2025, our intention is to continue funding our loan growth primarily with core customer deposits and progress against our strategic initiatives has provided several promising tailwinds on as we look to continue attracting, deepening and retaining customer relationships. As such, we expect core customer deposits to grow by 4% to 5% for the year. With that, I'll pass it to Derek to walk through the income statement and capital trends. Story Continues Derek Meyer Thanks, Andy. I'll start on slide 9 with our asset and liability yield trends. Following the 50 basis point Fed rate cut in September and subsequent 25 basis point cuts in November and December, earning asset yields and interest-bearing liability costs both fell meaningfully during the fourth quarter. Total bank in asset yields decreased by 22 basis points during the quarter, led by a 43 basis point decrease in CRE loans and a 53 basis point decrease in commercial and business lending both of which were largely floating rate portfolios that respond more quickly to changes in market rates. These decreases were partially offset by relative stability in our large fixed rate auto, resi and securities books. On the other side of the balance sheet, total liability costs decreased by 30 basis points during the quarter. This larger decrease was a function of our ability to decrease interest-bearing deposit costs by 22 basis points during the quarter along with our efforts to pay down wholesale funding. Moving to slide 10. Our total net interest income grew by $8 million versus the prior quarter and $17 million versus Q4 of 2023, landing at $270 million for the quarter. Our net interest margin expanded by 3 basis points to 2.81%. During the quarter, due to the timing of the securities reinvestment, which closed at the end of the year and the timing of the loan sale, which is expected to be settled by the end of the month, the NII benefit we saw in Q4 was largely driven by initial securities sale in the refinancing of our high-cost FHLB advances. On a pro forma basis, we estimate that our balance sheet repositioning, including the credit card balance acquisition we made in December, would have added approximately 17 more basis points to our net interest margin, having received a full quarter's benefit from the transaction. Based on our latest expectations for balance sheet growth, deposit betas and Fed action, along with the enhanced profitability from our balance sheet repositioning, we expect to drive net interest income growth of between 12% and 13% in 2025. On slide 11, we provide a reminder of the proactive steps we've taken to get a more neutral asset sensitivity position. Our auto book has grown to $2.8 billion as of year-end, providing a solid base of fixed rate assets with low prepayment risk and strong credit characteristics. In addition, as of December 31, and we maintained notional swap balances of approximately $2.7 billion. And finally, we had $10.3 billion in contractual funding obligations set to mature in 1 year or less as of Q4, which is over 90% of the total. Taken together, these actions have reduced our asset sensitivity over time with a down 100 ramp scenario representing about 0.5% impact to our NII at Q4. This is reduced from the 3.4% impact we were modeling in Q4 of 2022. Our goal is to maintain this modestly asset-sensitive position going forward. Shifting to slide 12. Our securities book increased to $8.5 billion on a period-end basis with the increase largely driven by the settlement of securities purchases as part of the balance sheet repositioning we announced in December. During the quarter, we saw a pickup in our CET1 ratio, thanks to capital raised from the common stock offering we announced in December. And after putting a portion of that capital to work in the balance sheet repositioning we announced in December, CET1 landed at an even 10% at year-end. We also saw a reduction in our AOCI impact due to our securities sale. And as such, the gap between our regulatory CET1 ratio and our CET1 plus AOCI ratio decreased to just 22 basis points in Q4. Following the transaction, our securities plus cash to total assets ratio rose to 22% for the fourth quarter, and we would expect to manage the ratio in the 22% to 24% range in 2025. Our noninterest income trends are highlighted on slide 13. As Andy mentioned, our GAAP results reflected a net loss for the fourth quarter, and this loss was driven by nonrecurring items tied to the balance sheet repositioning we announced in December. Adjusting for these results, our core noninterest income came in at $72 million in Q4, representing a $5 million increase versus the prior quarter and a $2 million increase versus our adjusted Q4 2023 figure. The quarterly increase was primarily driven in the increases in capital markets and mortgage banking income, partially offset by a decrease in bulding income. Compared to the same period last year, wealth management fees grew by $3 million, while deposit fees and mortgage banking income both grew by $2 million. In 2025, we expect noninterest income to grow by 0% to 1% as compared to our adjusted 2024 base of $269 million. Moving to slide 14. Our fourth quarter expenses were impacted by a $14 million loss on the prepayment of FHLB advances as part of our balance sheet repositioning. Excluding this nonrecurring item, our adjusted noninterest expense came in at $210 million in Q4. This adjusted number represents a $9 million increase from the third quarter, but just a $1 million increase from our adjusted Q4 2023 expenses. The bulk of the quarterly increase stemmed from investments in our organic initiatives, including an acceleration of hiring that increased our personnel expense in Q4. For the full year, our noninterest expense came in at $804 million after adjusting to exclude the nonrecurring loss on HLD prepayment. While we've continued to invest in people and strategies to support our growth plans, we've also remained squarely focused on managing our overall expense run rate on an ongoing basis. With that in mind, we expect the total noninterest expense growth of between 3% and 4% in 2025 off of our adjusted 2020 base of $804 million. On slide 15, we once again saw key capital ratios increased across the board here in Q4 after raising $331 million of capital with our November common stock offering. While we did put a portion of this capital to work with the balance sheet repositioning we announced in December, we still expect to maintain a higher level of capital than we did pre transaction. Our TCE ratio increased to 7.82% in Q4, which represents a 32 basis point increase relative to Q3 and a 71 basis point increase relative to Q4 of 2023. Our CET1 ratio steadily climbed throughout 2024 and currently sits at 10% as of Q4, a 28 basis point increase relative to Q3. With that said, we expect to see an incremental 7 basis points of benefits of CET1 once our loan sale closes here in Q1. Following the actions we took in Q4, our expectations for growth in 2025 and the current market conditions, we expect to manage CET1 within a range of 10% to 10.5% in 2025. I'll now hand it over to Chief Credit Officer, Pat Ahern, to provide an update on credit quality. Patrick Ahern Thanks, Derek. I'll start with an allowance update on slide 16. We utilized the Moody's November 2024 baseline forecast for our CECL forward-looking assumptions. The Moody's baseline forecast remains consistent with a resilient economy despite the high interest rate environment. The baseline forecast contains no additional rate hikes, slower but positive GDP growth rates, a cooling labor market and continued deceleration of inflation with continued monitoring of ongoing market developments. Our ACLL increased by another $5 million in Q4 to finish the quarter at $402 million with increases in the commercial and business lending and other consumer categories, partially offset by decreases in CRE and residential mortgage. The uptick in commercial largely stemmed from some migration into criticized loans during Q4. Similar to last quarter, we do not feel that this increase is an indication of a significant shift in credit stress but rather, it is a reflection of our assurance to risk rating definition guidance, acknowledging shifts in credit profiles. The bank does not view these credits representing risk of loss at this time. as reflected in our stable ACL. Altogether, our reserve to loan ratio increased by 2 basis points from the prior quarter and 3 basis points from the same period a year ago to 1.35%. Moving to slide 17. We maintained a high degree of confidence in the quality of our loan portfolio with continued solid performance in our core credit quality trends. Total bank-wide delinquencies increased to $80 million for the quarter representing a $24 million increase from the prior quarter but a $4 million decrease from Q4 of 2023. We continue to believe these trends are in line with our normal course of business and not necessarily something that's indicative of future credit stress. Importantly, the quarterly increase was limited to the 30- to 89-day bucket, reflecting some timing and completion of recent credit actions. 90-plus stage delinquencies have decreased both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year coming in at just $3 million in Q4. Further down the line, total criticized and classified loans increased from the prior quarter. The majority of this increase was driven by migration within C&I and CRE categories. Similar to Q3, we do not feel this increase is an indication of a significant shift in the credit profile of the portfolio but rather a reflection of conforming to industry guidance in a proactive and conservative approach relative to credit changes. We continue our ongoing portfolio deep dives and don't see a systemic shift in our commercial portfolios. In fact, we see potential near-term resolution in many of the noted downgrades as liquidity remains present in the market. Underpinning our confidence in the portfolio is the continued positive trends we're seeing in nonaccruals. We continue to see a steady pace of resolution within these stressed credits with total nonaccrual balances decreasing for the third consecutive quarter to $123 million. Importantly, we saw decreases in both commercial and business lending and CRE net accruals in Q4 as well. Finally, we booked $12 million in net charge-offs during the quarter and $17 million in provision, both of which represented the lowest numbers we've seen in the past several quarters. As Andy mentioned, our Q4 provision included a $3 million release for the sale of residential mortgage loans we announced in December and a $4 million provision build for a purchase of $55 million in credit card balances during the quarter. Our net charge-off ratio decreased by 2 basis points to 0.16%. In summary, our credit metrics continue to give us confidence that what we've seen to date is a handful of credits migrating within our rating system and not necessarily a sign of broader issues coming down the road in future quarters. Overall, outside of these specific situations, we remain comfortable in the normalized level of activity we've seen across the bank. Going forward, we remain diligent on monitoring credit stresses in the macro economy to ensure current underwriting reflects both inflation pressures and shifting labor markets to name just a few economic concerns. In addition, we continue to maintain specific attention to the effects of elevated interest rates on the portfolio, including ongoing interest rate sensitivity analysis bank-wide. We expect any future provision adjustments will continue to reflect changes to risk rates, economic conditions, loan volumes, and other indications of credit quality. With that, I will now pass it back to Andy for closing remarks. Andrew Harmening Thank you, Pat. I'll wrap up by reiterating a couple of key points from our presentation on slide 18, starting with the balance sheet. We continue to seek selective growth that emphasizes full banking relationships, quality credit profiles and diversification to deliver improved returns. With this in mind, we expect total loan growth of 5% to 6% in 2025. On the other side of the balance sheet, we continue to expect to fund the majority of our loan growth with growth in our core customer deposits. As such, we expect core customer deposits to grow by 4% to 5% in 2025. On the revenue front, we've adjusted our most recent forecast for balance sheet growth, deposit betas and Fed action, along with the enhanced profitability from our balance sheet repositioning. With all these factors incorporated, we expect to drive net interest income growth between 12% to 13% in 2025. We also continue to feel encouraged by the durability of our noninterest income in a challenged environment over the past couple of years, and we expect to grow noninterest income by 0% to 1% in '25 relative to our adjusted 2024 base. And finally, our disciplined approach to expenses remains a foundational focus. We continue to strategically invest in our business to support growth. With this in mind, we expect to hold noninterest expense growth to a range of 3% to 4% in 2025. And with that, I would like to open it up for questions. Question and Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions) Scott Siefers, Piper Sandler. Scott Siefers Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Let's see, Derek, I was hoping you could just discuss your thoughts on the trajectory of the margin from the fourth quarter is 2.81%. Look, I mean we've got a good starting point given the disclosure on slide 10 with the 2.98% pro forma, which presumably gets us the full benefit from the restructuring. But just curious about the other moving parts you see on the horizon. And then I guess within the response you can maybe discuss funding dynamics in a little detail given that you'd expect to grow deposits at a lower than loans this year? I know funding with core deposits is always a key priority. So just curious on those dynamics, please. Derek Meyer Yeah. Thanks, Scott. The -- so I think we're largely looking for a stable outlook in margin once we get the benefit of this there could be upside to that being that we're asset sensitive and the market bias right now seems to be fewer cuts than before. but we are asset sensitive and with the rate curve and our assumption in our outlook includes two cuts continue to drive improved profitability while rates are going down, exposes us to a little bit of that sensitivity. So what we expect to help us aside from this transaction and lock in closer to that 3% is the benefits of the hedge the hedging. So we have the hedging details we put in back for the first time. You'll see that we continue to reduce our asset sensitivity going forward in the downgrade scenario and that is the scenario that's out there in the implied forwards. And then the securities repositioning gives us upside to help lock that in and stay longer. And then the auto book, we dropped for the first time, we do expect that to stabilize and continue to modestly go up, albeit at a slower pace than it has been. From the funding dynamics, I think we -- when we put our guidance out from 2024, we had a gap there also. We managed to close that gap by the end of the year and predominantly fund our loan growth with deposit growth. I think we do want to recognize that's still take some build out from our side to support the new deposit vertical and closing that gap beyond what we've put in our guidance may start to accelerate towards the end of the year and into 2026. So we might see -- we've got essentially a 1% gap that we expect our wholesale funding to close, and we've got that GAAP capacity as a result of continuing to pay down FHLB funding from our current position. Tried to answer all your questions, Scott, but -- Scott Siefers Yeah, no, I think that's perfect and thank you. And I guess the final one was Andy, maybe you could talk about the $1.2 billion of C&I growth you expect this year? I think that compares to $750 million number you had discussed previously. I could be comparing apples to oranges but if I'm correct, maybe if you can just walk through the main drivers of that favorable delta? Andrew Harmening Yeah, of course. So I mean you're pretty close. Page 6 outlines a little bit of what the trend is right now. And I think we're roughly at about $840 million in growth in 2024 with about $1.2 billion in 2025. So if you look at our forecast going from 4%-plus growth in '24 to 5%-plus, 5% to 6% in '25, you can see it's largely coming from commercial. You can also see that there's a trend emerging. We expected back half of '24 to be stronger than the first half as we were ramping up. we have largely concluded our hiring. We'll expect to announce a few more to close that out in the first quarter. But we don't intend to spend the whole year hiring. This has been something that we announced in the fourth quarter and not only build the number, but we have gotten incredibly high-quality RM. So really, the increase in commercial is just a function of them being here a full year, will be more on average in the full year. and then really doing a ramped up production. So we have a lot clearer visibility into what's possible in 2025. So we just extrapolated that. I would add to that, that we have on the ABL and the leasing side, that's a business that we started about 3 years ago, and we've continued to grow it. It now has about $1.2 billion in outstandings. But that continues the opportunity for us as well. So the commercial growth plan that we've had is right on track, and I'm very pleased with where we are heading into the year-end and that is why we see that ramp up in growth in 2025. Scott Siefers Perfect. All right. Thank you very much. Andrew Harmening Thank you, Scott. Operator Daniel Tamayo, Raymond James. Daniel Tamayo Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. I guess, first, just on the credit side, one for Pat here. You've talked about the deep dive that you're doing on the loan portfolio and how that's impacting the ratings on the loans. I'm just curious how far along you are in that process and if we should expect to continue to see some migration just related to the work that you're doing in that? Patrick Ahern We're doing the deep dives -- just for clarity, we're doing on a constant basis, and we've been doing it for the last couple of years. So really, what you're seeing is just early recognition of any changes in credit. So that's an ongoing process that we're constantly looking at. And I would say from quarter-to-quarter, there's certainly ins and outs that come with the normal course of business. And we're just trying to be a little more proactive on how we're doing the risk rating to get ahead of it if there is going to be any stress. But the good news is we're not seeing any buildup in the nonaccrual. So we think we're staying ahead of these things as they do pop up. Daniel Tamayo Okay, thank you. And then maybe one for you, Andy. With these significant changes that you've been making overall that you've talked a lot about and then the balance sheet changes that you made here in the fourth quarter, do you think it's likely that the major changes are over? It sounds like you're through the majority of the hiring on the commercial side. But as it relates to the balance sheet structure, does it feel like the major changes are done? Or are there still some changes that you'd be interested in making in the future? Andrew Harmening Well, it's a great question. So what I would say is what we needed to prove out is that we could grow organically and we could shift the mix. We're proving that out right now. We saw an opportunity to inorganically take down our residential real estate concentration of noncustomer residential real estate. And we've largely done that. Will there be other opportunities? We don't have anything planned in 2024. But there are always different opportunities that we look at from an organic growth standpoint. And right now because we have a business that is growing on the commercial side, it's growing its deposit base. It has household growth. We have customer satisfaction. We've invested in digital we have the ability to scale at this point. So opportunistically, if there's a deal in the next 12 to 24 months, we have a team that's very stable and could move down that path. But right now, for 2024, what I see is a really good opportunity to execute on the organic side. Daniel Tamayo Okay, great. Well, I appreciate you taking my questions. Thank you. Andrew Harmening Thanks, Daniel. Operator Terry McEvoy, Stephens. Terry McEvoy Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe, Andy, a question for you. The record high customer satisfaction scores, the Net Promoter Score is all moving in the right direction. My question is, how and where does that translate into growth when we look at the balance sheet and the income statement? And does that give you the confidence in the 6% core consumer deposit growth that you've talked about? Andrew Harmening Yeah, Terry. I think if I were at a town hall, I think that was a planted question because that is right in our wheelhouse. And I've talked a lot about customer satisfaction. We've talked about household growth and we want to make that a question that's on the road somewhere. And so I'll break it down like this. In '22, we shrunk our customer base 1%. In '23, we grew at 0% in '24, we grew at 1%, and now we're forecasting 2%. The reason that matters is because between '22 and '24, the quality of account in dollars increased 23%. So the number that we have now for growth, every time we grow by 1%, that equates to about $150 million in additional balances. So this is the first time we've had a tailwind coming into the year in over a decade. And that tailwind and that productivity expectation now goes from $150 million to a 2% growth, it goes to $300 million. So we look at that then we add on top of that, we added a posit vertical that's just getting started. We've hired really talented people, and we're accelerating whatever technology expectations we have to make sure that they are effective. but there's no doubt that they are experts in what they do. We add on to that 20-plus RMs going into the year with a balanced scorecard that incents them to bring in full relationships. That is just an acceleration of everything we've done. And then we don't talk about it a whole lot, but we've invested in our HSA business, which is also a deposit-heavy business. So when I add household growth with quality accounts, when we add new deposit vertical, when we had increase in RM's balance scorecard and HSA, we're not just hoping that we grow faster than the marketplace. We've invested in the strategies to do that. And so that's where I get a confidence on where I see the deposit growth coming. Terry McEvoy I swear, they didn't e-mail me that question, I swear . And then just as a follow-up, I think we all would agree, you're positioned to play offense in '25. Some of the larger banks are now committing to grow loan growth this year and maybe more of your metro markets. So how did you think about your expense guide for the year? And what might be a more competitive environment, especially as what Scott brought up on the C&I side, where you had a lot of success in the second half of the year? Andrew Harmening Maybe I'll translate that question. Is it -- can we stay in the 3% to 4%? Or do we have pressure on the upside? Is that what you mean on the expense number? Terry McEvoy No, I was talking on the loan growth and large banks being more added competitive. Andrew Harmening Yeah, on the pricing side. And so what -- I've actually been asking this question this week, whether that be from our Chief Credit Officer, who sees every deal or our Head of Commercial. And across the markets that we're in, with the verticals that we're in, we have not experienced the pricing pressure on the deals that we've been putting on the books. And as you can see, we've been putting an increased amount on the books. And so when you get quality relationship managers that have market knowledge and long-term relationships, that's the primary driver. We would not be immune, of course, if the marketplace created that pressure on pricing on new deals, but we just haven't seen it at this point. Derek Meyer Thanks for taking my questions. Andrew Harmening Thank you, Terry. Operator (Operator Instructions) And if there are no further questions, I'd like to turn the floor back to management for any closing comments. Andrew Harmening Well, what I will say in closing is we have as much momentum heading into the year as we've had in the four years that I've been here. We appreciate your interest in the Associated Bank story, and we look forward to providing updates as the year goes along. Thank you. Operator This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you again for your participation.

best form since joining the club last summer from PSG (JAVIER SORIANO) Just when it seemed the pressure of a lifelong dream switch to Real Madrid might prove too great for Kylian Mbappe to overcome, the French superstar silenced his doubters. After a troubled start to life at Madrid, Mbappe finally seems at home and ready to wreak havoc both in Spain and in Europe. Mbappe's rediscovered elan comes at the perfect time for Real Madrid with two crucial Champions League matches ahead, starting with RB Salzburg's visit to the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday. Madrid then face Brest on the road next week, aiming to secure progress to the next phase of the competition. It would be unthinkable for the holders and record 15-time European champions to suffer an early knock-out, but after a poor start they are presently 20th in the 36-team group, with the bottom 12 teams eliminated. Madrid lost at Liverpool, with Mbappe missing a penalty, as well as against AC Milan at home and away at Lille. Shortly after the defeat at Anfield, Mbappe missed another spot kick in a La Liga defeat by Athletic Bilbao and it proved a turning point for the France captain. \"A big mistake in a match where every detail counts, I take full responsibility for it,\" said Mbappe in a post on social media platform Instagram. \"It's the best time to change this situation and show who I am.\" Since pledging to turn things around, Mbappe has scored eight goals in 10 games for Madrid across all competitions, including a stunning solo effort against Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final. Mbappe also struck as Madrid won the Intercontinental Cup against Pachuca in December, but beyond the goals, he now looks every part the devastating, world-beating talent president Florentino Perez hoped for. - 'Moves only he can make' - Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti has been patient with Mbappe, often defending the forward and insisting he needed time to adapt to life in the Spanish capital and gel with his new team-mates. The Italian also stuck by his guns with regards to Mbappe's positioning, insisting from the start of the season the French hitman should play down the middle, leaving Vinicius Junior to stay on the left flank in his preferred role. Mbappe and Vinicius struggled to gel, at times occupying the same spaces on the pitch. The team's 4-0 Clasico humbling by bitter rivals Barcelona in October was a particularly disappointing moment for Mbappe, who was caught offside numerous times in the match by the Catalans' high defensive line. Left out of the national team squads for Nations League matches at the time by coach Didier Deschamps and battling with former employers Paris Saint-Germain over unpaid income, Mbappe seemed weighed down and overwhelmed. Story Continues Ancelotti persisted with the striker and said at the end of December Mbappe had bedded in and, after a thigh injury, was now ready to perform at his best. \"His (adaptation) period, which he obviously needed, because everyone needs it, is over,\" said the coach. \"Where does Mbappe have to improve? Just in consistency... trying to make the moves that only he can make, as often as possible.\" Perhaps unsurprisingly, Ancelotti, a record five-time European Cup winner as a coach, was right. Mbappe's skill and speed have made him unstoppable in recent weeks and the 26-year-old looks increasingly confident in himself with every passing match. \"The Bilbao game was good for me, I hit the bottom... and it was a moment to realise that I have to give everything for this shirt and show my personality,\" said Mbappe at the end of 2024. Mbappe produced arguably his finest display for Madrid as he netted a brace against Las Palmas on Sunday to help take Real top of La Liga. \"I have adapted to the team and I can play how I want, with my team-mates, with personality,\" he said after the game. Vinicius was suspended against Las Palmas but will return in the Champions League, and he and Mbappe must continue developing their partnership. If Madrid's dynamic duo can find the same wavelength they will be ready to defend their status as the kings of Europe. rbs/pi View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard Recommended
