[{"text": "The Private Equity Puzzle: Rebuilding Portfolios After M&A Craze Darren Barbee Tue, Jan 28, 2025, 5:28 AM 16 min read In This Article: EOG +0.48% Each of the past three World Jigsaw Puzzle Champion winners assembled 500-piece Ravensburger scenes\u2014tigers prowling jungles, blue-chaired outdoor cafes, pastel housing\u2014in less than 40 minutes. As impressive as that is, jigsawing a shale unit map of the Haynesville Shale would clearly be next level. For one, the Haynesville covers about 5.76 million square acres\u2014each a potential piece. And Louisiana state activity maps show shale units in red, preproduction in green triangles. The overall effect is of a Christmassy Lite-Brite project gone too far. Still, it\u2019s what\u2019s not there that could matter. The puzzle for private equity\u2019s startups in all shales is to find the spots that don\u2019t yet shine. And, regardless of the play, it won\u2019t be easy after rampant M&A ransacked the Lower 48\u2019s PE portfolio companies, along with some large publics. Beginning early last year, Post Oak Energy Capital began supporting a number of companies with equity commitments. The companies are working to assemble positions in some of those same lucrative (and expensive) plays as private equity firms begin to rebuild after the running of the M&A bulls. During the latter part of 2024, Oil and Gas Investor caught up with three of the new companies: the Haynesville Shale\u2019s Quantent Energy Partners ; Delaware Basin-focused Ichthys Energy Partners ; and the Utica Shale\u2019s Tiburon Oil & Gas Partners . Building a profitable footprint in any of those plays will be no easy task. Quantent, Ichthys and Tiburon are banking on a network of connections, a feel for their respective plays and a willingness to lock down every profitable piece of acreage still available. All while facing off in the oil and gas version of Squid Game: A&D. The Louisiana state activity map of the Haynesville is so dense that even a jigsaw puzzle master would struggle to find the individual pieces\u2014but that won\u2019t stop companies from trying. (Source: Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources) In the Haynesville, most of the best and biggest blocks of acreage are locked down by major producers waiting to cash in on increased LNG exports. Operators range from privately held Aethon Energy to public E&P Expand Energy, the country\u2019s largest natural gas producer. Expand holds 650,000 net acres in the play and averaged 2,452 MMcfe/d in the third quarter. But Quantent has already locked down one acquisition and sees more opportunities ahead. In the Utica, the liquids-rich areas have been swarmed by new entrants chasing EOG Resources and jockeying with top producers Encino Energy, Ascent Resources and Infinity Natural Resources. Finding a viable large contiguous position will be increasingly difficult there. Scott Hudson, president and CEO of Tiburon, sees a lot more grassroots leasing that can be done in what he calls \u201cpockets\u201d or \u201cdonut holes\u201d in which an operator can pick up three-or five-well units. Story Continues \u201cThose definitely do exist,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re not going to go up into the Utica and pick up 10,000 acres in the windows that we\u2019re talking about today, but there are definitely opportunities out there.\u201d Pieces of the Permian Then there\u2019s the picked-over Permian, which lacks any convenient edges or an inviting lid depicting the sweep of counties stretching from arid Texas to arid New Mexico. With its horizontal wells jutting every which way, the Permian is vast and competitive. And, again, large independent E&Ps and majors hoard the best pieces. The consolidation in the basin, including large-scale deals by Occidental Petroleum, Diamondback Energy and Exxon Mobil , creates a space for Ichthys \u201cto come in and hopefully do some cleanup work on the smaller side, building those assets that way,\u201d Ichthys CEO Michael Poynter said. The other benefit of all the Permian M&A is that, as larger companies get even larger, \u201ctheir appetite and focus on the much smaller interests that take time and some dirty work to piece together into something more valuable is maybe just less meaningful and doesn\u2019t move the needle as much for them.\u201d Post Oak\u2019s teams are largely made up of new blood, unlike the tried-and-true portfolio companies EnCap Investments and Quantum Capital Group that are re-upping with more funding. ( NGP Energy Capital has said it\u2019s unlikely to fund more than a couple of new teams.) Frost Cochran, managing director and founding partner of Post Oak, told Hart Energy in October that Ichthys, based in Dallas, is a group of \u201cyoung guys who are just getting started with their first company, but they\u2019re focusing in the area that they know best, which is the Permian and specifically more, the northern Delaware.\u201d The company\u2019s leadership was spun off of Permian Resources . Cochran said private equity has to source new, younger teams that \u201chave the skill sets and capabilities \u2026 with some support from us from the capital side. And whatever we can do to try to match assets with teams, we do as well.\u201d Some of the Post Oak teams had made initial acquisitions and held acreage out of the gate when the private equity firm committed equity to their ventures. Other teams were still looking. What unites Post Oak\u2019s teams is a shared entrepreneurial drive and that special trait common in startups: confidence in their strategies, experience and expertise. Haynesville 9,000 Quantent CEO Kevin DeLay views the Haynesville\u2019s opportunity set, essentially, as a math equation. The Haynesville comprises 9,000 sq miles\u2014an area larger than the nation of Israel. And within that expanse are a lot of tracts that aren\u2019t getting the attention, or capex, they need. \u201cThey\u2019re underdeveloped either due to lack of capitalization or operational expertise to develop those positions,\u201d DeLay said. \u201cWe really feel like, with our operational background and track record, plus with our ability to be creative on deal structures, there\u2019s a lot of opportunities still left in the Haynesville to get into those parts of play.\u201d DeLay is well-versed on the Haynesville. DeLay served in engineering and management roles at Devon Energy , including operations and portfolio management. He also served as general manager at McClendon Energy Partners and led engineering efforts for several new ventures at Chesapeake Energy founder Aubrey McClendon\u2019s American Energy Partners. \u201cAubrey loved the play,\u201d DeLay said. \u201cHe was always very excited about it. I will admit he was excited when I came to him in 2014 saying I thought the play had bigger potential.\u201d DeLay had observed a set of about 12 wells that had used larger completions\u2014more sand and fluid. \u201cAnd one-for-one, every one of those wells outperformed their direct offsets and gave me a feeling that the Haynesville had a step change of performance in front of it with new completion techniques,\u201d he said. Before co-founding Quantent, DeLay served and directed upstream development projects as COO at Nadel and Gussman New Ventures, which was backed by Post Oak. He largely worked in the Haynesville, drilling out more than 40 wells, often at 20% lower costs than an offset operator. In 2023, the Haynesville was still top of mind. DeLay\u2019s thesis: a lot of potential remains in the play. In September, Post Oak announced the closing of an equity commitment to Quantent and its initial acquisition of 7,000 net acres in North Louisiana. Quantent captured an asset in the play \u201coffsetting an existing asset we had in the Haynesville,\u201d Cochran said. The management team \u201cwas the execution team with that prior asset we worked with. So, it\u2019s really a second iteration with that team on a similar asset.\u201d The company\u2019s strategy is to find untapped inventory and maximize its operational expertise. Following its September acquisition, DeLay said Quantent had a solid proved developed producing (PDP) base. Ultimately, however, the company is looking for places to put the drill bit into the ground while searching for more upside locations through acquisitions. \u201cObviously, if the deal has PDP involved and it works into our economics and we will go after it. But I would say, right now, we are focused on trying to find undeveloped locations,\u201d DeLay said. And the company is in the play for the long haul. \u201cStrategically, anything we buy, we\u2019re going to be willing to fully develop and produce. That has to be the strategy at this point in the cycle of our industry.\u201d And that plays to the strengths of Quantent\u2019s team. DeLay said an important lesson McClendon taught him was the value of expertise. \u201cYour people are the most important part of your company. [You can] have the best rock in the world, but if you don\u2019t have people to execute it, then you\u2019re not going to be a top performer,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we bring in some of, what I consider, the best experts in the field to come drill these wells with us and complete them.\u201d Tiburon set for 2Q Utica drilling Scott Hudson worked in nine shale basins during his career at Carrizo Oil & Gas before the company was sold to Callon Petroleum . About two years ago, Hudson started to think back on one play in particular: the Utica. While digging into the Utica at Carrizo, there\u2019d been no modern day frac techniques brought to bear, he said. Right-sizing well spacing hadn\u2019t been implemented. Around 2013, Hudson was also working without the benefits of fully built out midstream infrastructure, which was a challenge and expense for the company at the time. Hudson\u2019s conclusion: All the lessons that had been applied to the Delaware and Midland basins and the Eagle Ford Shale ought to be brought to the Utica. \u201cI kind of felt like, \u2018Hey, there was a big opportunity.\u2019\u201d And Tiburon was born. Considering the various basins, his expertise and his team\u2019s expertise, the Utica seemed ripe for the picking. And so, Tiburon was built from a team forged at Carrizo, largely with experience in the Appalachian Basin. In mid-October, Tiburon, backed by an investment from Post Oak, closed on an initial acquisition of leasehold in the liquids-rich portion of the Utica. When EOG Resources announced their success in finding oil in the Utica in 2022, the liquids-rich areas were swarmed by new entrants chasing their success and jockeying with top producers. Finding a viable large contiguous position in the play is increasingly difficult. (Source: Shutterstock) Hudson said Tiburon had been working for a year on grassroots leasing. The acquisition, with some other funding, allowed the startup to coalesce a sizeable acreage position with enough running room to get started. \u201cWe\u2019re really excited about how many acres that we have out there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the ability to drill about 30 wells. So, it\u2019s a sizable footprint that we\u2019ve been able to put together.\u201d But, in November 2022, EOG Resources announced what it called the \u201cUtica Combo\u201d play in Ohio, including the acquisition of about 395,000 net acres in Ohio\u2019s volatile oil window and black oil windows. EOG\u2019s publicly disclosed successes in the play quickly overshadowed the play\u2019s gassy reputation. A&D efforts began to focus on liquids. In October, Infinity Natural Resources filed paperwork to launch an IPO. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely gotten a lot more competitive in the last 12 months since EOG announced their presence in the basin, whereas when we started, there were [few] people looking in the basin,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cNow, there\u2019s a ton of competition.\u201d Hudson said the company has built a solid position while actively grabbing additional units where \u201cwe can find additional sticks to drill,\u201d Hudson said. The company has no set parameters on its eventual size. It will likely be a 10-person shop in the near term. For now, the plan is to scout out good opportunities and acquire while setting up rigs, drilling and turning wells to production. The company plans to start production in the second quarter. For now, the team is enthusiastic as it begins to apply advanced completions to the Utica. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to work with Post Oak. They\u2019ve been incredibly supportive,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re ready to get that rig up in the air.\u201d But that\u2019s been the team\u2019s path since their Carrizo days. \u201cWe had this lease and drill strategy where we wanted to go in and we wanted to take our expertise that we\u2019ve had for the last decade, decade and a half, and we wanted to go in and get this opportunity to get this acreage that we had put together and develop \u2026 not drill one or two wells,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to drill the whole well set, and so they believed in that methodology.\u201d Hudson said he\u2019s been in the industry about a quarter of the century\u2014on the young side for oil and gas veterans. \u201cBut yeah, we\u2019re still hungry,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat my team loves to do is lease and drill, lease and drill. That\u2019s what we did at Carrizo together. That\u2019s what we want to do now. And so, we\u2019re just really excited about it.\u201d Permian itch Building a new position in the incredibly competitive Permian Basin can seem daunting, but young and nimble companies like Icthys are banking on their experience and entrepreneurial spirit to make a space for themselves. (Source: Shutterstock) Ichthys\u2019 approach to building a position in the Permian Basin\u2014specifically the northern Delaware\u2014 is to do it any way it can. So far, the company hasn\u2019t made an acquisition. But the company has multiple strategies, including picking up smaller assets that are not meaningful enough for the larger E&Ps to spend time on. Poynter said the initial pitch to Post Oak was focused on the networking, relations and experience his team, with roots in Permian Resources and Colgate Energy , had in Midland, Texas, and in the basin. The more nuts-and-bolts strategy of the company is to create an operated E&P with a focus on a land-first ground game, building up from smaller acquisitions into one or two drillable units at a time. \u201cI think that strategy really resonated with the Post Oak team. It\u2019s reflected in a lot of my past experience of teams that I\u2019ve been on from the private equity company building side where we have done things from sort of the ground up,\u201d he said. \u201cI think, given our backgrounds and the companies, the successful companies that we\u2019ve been at, [we] really fit with that strategy.\u201d However, Poynter said the company\u2019s business development pipeline could range from grassroots leasing to acquiring smaller non-operated interests \u201cwhere we see a strategic angle to trade with other parties or participate in forced pooling, for instance, to maybe the third being farm-in opportunities and strategic partnerships with others in that way.\u201d Another avenue is the post-consolidation rationalization acquirers are likely to engage in. Poynter said the company may look at larger packages or marketed processes. Ichthys CFO Will Weidig said the consolidation-driven asset rationalization deals can be divided into two buckets. \u201cThere\u2019s what I would call the macro bucket and a micro bucket. And the macro would be what Michael mentioned around large marketed assets, where an investment bank is sending out teasers and it\u2019s a $500 million plus [to] $2 billion type of transaction,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s the micro-scale deal, which is kind of what Michael mentioned secondarily, which is the smaller transaction, the DSU that was originally on the drill schedule that now isn\u2019t and therefore creates some kind of optionality for us. I think we\u2019ll be more focused on the latter. And that\u2019s not to say we\u2019ll be fully cut off from the macro bucket, but I think it\u2019ll be more opportunistic to see us engage in something like that.\u201d Poynter added that the company would participate in large deals if a \u201creal strategic edge\u201d emerges \u201cas opposed to us just outbidding other parties.\u201d Poynter said he recognizes the Permian is a highly competitive market, but \u201cthat\u2019s a big part of why we want to be there.\u201d \u201cWe go back to the strategy and the partnership with Post Oak and how that fits and think that this is the right time \u2026 on the consolidation side to be pursuing a strategy like this. I think we also have the right backgrounds from our prior experiences with both private and public companies in the Permian. We\u2019re both intimately familiar with the Permian Basin, but then also our networks within Midland and the Permian, as well.\u201d Weidig said the company\u2019s willingness to be nimble and creative to get deals done is key, \u201cwhether that\u2019s from a structuring perspective, a partnership perspective or just being willing to do a series of smaller transactions versus maybe one splashy larger deal.\u201d \u201cI think all of those will accrue to our benefit as we go out and execute the strategy,\u201d Weidig said. In the next three to five years, Poynter sees Ichthys focused on building units from the ground up and maintaining an ongoing series of operated drilling units that are staggered so that, by the time the first wells are generating cash flow, new wells are being drilled or coming online. \u201cI think my vision a few years from now would be that we\u2019ve made this strategy repeatable enough to have multiple projects going\u201d with varying \u201cmaturation points\u201d and cycles of \u201cdeveloping, partnering, potentially even buying and selling various pieces all simultaneously by that point and continuing to build the business organically.\u2026\u201d Ichthys started with what Poynter called a \u201csort of entrepreneurial itch.\u201d \u201cFor me it was just kind of time,\u201d Poynter said. \u201cWe had accomplished what we set out to accomplish with the Colgate investment and then had seen Permian Resources stabilized and headed in the right direction.\u201d Weidig said he has the same entrepreneurial streak. \u201cFor me, it was identifying timing, a partner to work with and a partner from the private equity perspective, just that really rounded out the picture and made it make sense and look really compelling,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really found that, in terms of what we think is a really attractive market opportunity right now.\u201d All of that added up to, \u201cHey, this is the right time with the right people,\u201d he said, \u201cand, we think, the right strategy to go and execute.\u201d View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard

Keith Speights, The Motley Fool Sun, Jan 26, 2025, 1:46 PM 5 min read In This Article: DSL -0.47% BLK -5.74% What's a way to generate significant passive income that many investors don't know about? Closed-end funds (CEFs) . They're similar to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in that they trade like stocks on public exchanges. The main difference is that CEFs have a fixed number of shares whereas ETFs can issue new shares. If you're an income investor, CEFs might be especially attractive. There are many funds from which to choose, but a few stand out to me. Investing $10,000 into each of these CEFs could make you over $4,700 in passive income in 2025. 1. AllianceBernstein Global High Income Fund The \"high income\" in the AllianceBernstein Global High Income Fund 's (NYSE: AWF) name isn't just marketing hype. This CEF offers a distribution yield of 6.9%. An initial investment of $10,000 in the fund should generate $690 in passive income this year based on that yield. This CEF invests mainly in corporate debt securities. Most of its portfolio is in lower-rated corporate bonds (which generate higher yields), but the fund's holdings can also include investment-grade corporate bonds, government bonds, and other assets. The AllianceBernstein Global High Income Fund currently has 1,218 holdings. 2. BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund The BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund (NYSE: DSU) pays an especially juicy distribution yield of 11.04%. If you bought $10,000 worth of the fund's shares, you'd likely receive income in the ballpark of $1,104 in 2025. Instead of bonds, this CEF primarily invests in other corporate debt instruments -- mainly corporate loans. Some (although not all) of these loans are secured by assets pledged as collateral. This generally makes them safer to invest in than other types of corporate debt. 3. Cohen & Steers Infrastructure Fund The Cohen & Steers Infrastructure Fund (NYSE: UTF) attempts to generate income by investing in stocks and debt issued by infrastructure companies. It currently has 252 holdings with top positions including five energy and utility stocks: NextEra Energy , NiSource , TC Energy , PPL , and Duke Energy . This CEF's distribution yield stands at 7.63%. An initial investment of $10,000 should enable you to rake in around $763 in passive income this year. 4. DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund The DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund (NYSE: DSL) has two goals: (1) provide a high level of income, and (2) deliver capital appreciation. It's definitely achieving the first goal these days with a distribution yield of 10.48%. Investing $10,000 in the CEF should give you income of roughly $1,048 in 2025. Story Continues This CEF is managed by Jeffrey Gundlach, who some call the \"Bond King.\" Unsurprisingly, the fund invests primarily in bonds, most of which are below investment grade. The DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund's holdings also include asset-backed securities, bank loans, and collateralized loan obligations. 5. Pimco Dynamic Income Opportunities Fund I've saved the biggest passive income generator for last. The Pimco Dynamic Income Opportunities Fund (NYSE: PDO) pays a distribution yield of 11.2%. Buying $10,000 worth of the fund's shares should make you $1,120 in income this year. Like the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund, the Pimco Dynamic Income Opportunities Fund focuses primarily on delivering income and secondarily on capital appreciation. This CEF's holdings include non-agency mortgages, U.S. government bonds, and high-yield credit assets. Four things to know about these CEFs Could investing $10,000 in each of the above CEFs really make you over $4,700 in passive income this year? Absolutely. However, there are four things income investors should know about them. First, the actual amount of income you receive could be lower than $4,700. It's possible that one or more of these funds could reduce their distributions in the coming months. On the other hand, some or all of them could also increase their distributions. Second, the share prices of these CEFs could be volatile. As is the case with investing in stocks and ETFs, investing in CEFs could entail losses. That said, several of these funds have delivered impressive total returns over the last year. Third, unlike most ETFs, CEFs often use leverage. For example, the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund's leverage from borrowing is 22.05%. The use of leverage can boost income generated but can also cause losses to be greater. Fourth, these CEFs have greater annual expenses than many ETFs do. The funds' managers charge hefty fees for delivering such juicy distributions. For example, the BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund's gross expense ratio is 2.47%. The good news, though, is the yields discussed earlier are net of any expenses.

The La Loutre project site is within the Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg (KZA) First Nation\u2019s territory. The KZA First Nation is part of the Algonquin Nation, and the KZA traditional territory is situated within the Outaouais and Laurentides regions. Located 180 kilometers northwest of Montreal, the property consists of one large, continuous block with 76 mineral claims totalling 4,528 hectares (45.3 km2). The La Loutre Property is underlain by rocks from the Grenville Province of the Precambrian Canadian Shield. The Grenville was formed under conditions that were very favorable for the development of coarse-grained, flake-type graphite mineralization from organic-rich material during high-temperature metamorphism. Lomiko published an updated Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") in a NI 43-101 Technical Report and Mineral Resource Estimate Update for the La Loutre Project, Quebec, Canada, prepared by InnovExplo on May 11th, 2023, which estimated 64.7 million tonnes of Indicated Mineral Resources averaging 4.59% Cg per tonne for 3.0 million tonnes of graphite, a tonnage increase of 184%. Indicated Mineral Resources increased by 41.5 million tonnes as a result of the 2022 drilling campaign, from 17.5 million tonnes in 2021 MRE with additional Mineral resources reported down-dip and within marble units resulted in the addition of 17.5 million tonnes of Inferred Mineral Resources averaging 3.51% Cg per tonne for 0.65 million tonnes of contained graphite; and the additional 13,107 metres of infill drilling in 79 holes completed in 2022 combined with the refinement of the deposit and structural models contributed to the addition of most of the Inferred Mineral Resources to the Indicated Mineral Resource category, relative to the 2021 Mineral Resource Estimate. The MRE assumes a US$1,098.07 per tonne graphite price and a cut-off grade of 1.50% Cg (graphitic carbon). In addition to La Loutre, Lomiko has earned-in its 49% stake in the Bourier Project from Critical Elements Lithium Corporation as per the option agreement announced on April 27th, 2021. The Bourier project site is located near Nemaska Lithium and Critical Elements south-east of the Eeyou Istchee James Bay territory in Quebec, which consists of 203 claims for a total ground position of 10,252.20 hectares (102.52 km2), in Canada\u2019s lithium triangle near the James Bay region of Quebec that has historically housed lithium deposits and mineralization trends. The company also holds interest in seven early stage projects in southern Quebec including Ruisseau, Tremblant, Meloche, Boyd, Dieppe, North Low and Carmin covering 328 claims in total on 7 early-stage projects covering 18,622 hectares in the Laurentian region of Quebec and within KZA territory.

South Pilot Project Falcon Oil & Gas Ltd. Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 10:00 AM 7 min read In This Article: FOLGF +2.97% Falcon Oil & Gas Ltd. Falcon Oil & Gas Ltd. Beetaloo Operational Update \u2013 Stimulation Campaign & Remaining Shenandoah South Pilot Project 24 January 2025 \u2013 Falcon Oil & Gas Ltd. (TSXV: FO, AIM: FOG) is pleased to announce the commencement of stimulation campaign at the Shenandoah S2-2H ST1 (\u201c S2-2H ST1 \u201d) and Shenandoah S2-4H (\u201c S2-4H \u201d) wells in the Beetaloo Sub-Basin, Northern Territory, Australia with Falcon Oil & Gas Australia Limited\u2019s (\u201c Falcon \u201d) joint venture partner, Tamboran (B2) Pty Limited (collectively the \u201c Beetaloo JV partners \u201d). Key Highlights of the Stimulation Campaign Stimulation campaign will be completed across: S2-2H ST1\u2019s horizontal section of 1,654 metres (5,427 feet) and; S2-4H\u2019s horizontal section of 2,977 metres (9,766 feet). Liberty Energy (NYSE: LBRT) who mobilised equipment and sand to location before the end of last year will carry out the stimulation campaign on behalf of the Beetaloo JV partners. Shenandoah South Pilot Project (\u201cPilot\u201d) For the next drilling phase of the Pilot, which involves the drilling and stimulation of the remaining four wells, Falcon has elected to reduce its participating interest (\u201c PI \u201d) from 5% to 0%. Key Highlights of the Reduced Participating Interest The election by Falcon to reduce its PI to 0% in the remaining four wells of the Pilot will significantly reduce it\u2019s 2025 capital expenditure. Falcon participated in the Shenandoah S-1H well in 2023 at its 22.5% PI which created a Drill Spacing Unit (\u201c DSU \u201d) of 20,480 acres. Falcon participated in the S2-2H ST1 and the S2-4H wells in 2024 at its reduced 5% PI which created two DSU\u2019s totalling 46,080 acres. The Beetaloo JV partners are planning on creating an enlarged area around the Pilot, known as the First Strategic Development Area (\u201c FSDA \u201d), which would amalgamate the acreage and PIs from the DSUs mentioned above and any further DSUs that may be created as part of the Pilot Depending on the ultimate size of the planned FSDA Falcon\u2019s combined participation entitlement in the FSDA post the Pilot could be up to 10%. Falcon also retains a 22.5% PI in the remaining 4.52 million acres in the Beetaloo, net 1 million acres to Falcon. Philip O\u2019Quigley, CEO of Falcon commented : \u201c We are extremely encouraged about the potential of the current stimulation program based on strong gas shows and other data observed whilst drilling both wells. In addition, we are very confident that the experienced US operator, Liberty Energy, will provide us with the greatest opportunity for the best possible outcome from this stimulation program. We look forward to updating the market on the IP30 flow test results as soon as they become available. Story Continues Reducing our participation in the next four wells has a minimal impact on our overall interest in the Beetaloo which remains at 22.5%. This demonstrates the optionality afforded by the DSUs, which enable Falcon to strategically and efficiently deploy its capital. This reduction in our participation in the next four wells significantly reduces our 2025 capital expenditure whilst at the same time leaving us very well positioned to capture the overall success of the Beetaloo.

Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) and Opioid Treatment Programs (OTP) in Partnership with NaphCare Business Wire Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 5:00 PM 4 min read BIRMINGHAM, Ala. & RENO, Nev., January 23, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--The Washoe County Sheriff\u2019s Office (WCSO) and their correctional healthcare partner, NaphCare, Inc ., are proud to announce the expansion of the Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) and Opioid Treatment Programs (OTP) at the Washoe County Detention Facility. By administering medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), this initiative aims to lower the risk of relapse and fatal overdose among patients, while promoting long-term recovery. Notably, the Washoe County Detention Facility is the only detention center in Nevada to earn certification as an OTP by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to provide opioid treatment within the jail. \"Redefining the care for those in our custody was a top priority for the Sheriff\u2019s Office,\" Washoe County Sheriff Darin Balaam said. \"The success of the MAT Program is measured by recidivism. Over the past five years we\u2019ve shown a great reduction in recidivism for those people that have been in our MAT program. Of the 716 participants in the first five years, only 208, or 29.1%, recidivated within one year; as compared to a national average of 45.8%. There are only 11 opioid treatment programs in the state, and we are the only jail-based opioid treatment program. This is a testament to our desire, and the desire of our medical provider, to work together treating the needs of those in our care. We thank NaphCare for being our partners in this program, and we look forward to continuing to work to improve outcomes for those we serve.\" Research shows that opioid use is significantly higher among incarcerated individuals compared to the general U.S. population, and those recently released from prison face an increased risk of fatal drug overdose. With the expansion of its MAT and OTP programs, Washoe County Detention Facility can better manage patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) immediately upon incarceration, ensuring continuous care that supports their health throughout incarceration and during their reintegration into the community. \"NaphCare is honored to partner with the Washoe County Detention Facility to enhance and expand our program, ensuring that we provide high-quality, comprehensive care to each and every individual,\" said Dr. Elliot Wade, MD, Regional Corporate Medical Director for NaphCare. \"By providing MAT and OTP services, we are collectively improving health outcomes by reducing patients\u2019 risk of relapse and fatal overdose and helping to sustain recovery.\" Story Continues In 2021, the Washoe County Detention Facility received accreditation from the National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) for meeting its standards for Opioid Treatment Programs in correctional facilities. And this year, the Washoe County Detention Facility was awarded the Pinnacle Award by the NCCHC.

PM 9 min read In This Article: AUMBF +0.73% VANCOUVER, BC , Jan. 22, 2025 /CNW/ - 1911 Gold Corporation (\" 1911 Gold \" or the \" Company \") (TSXV: AUMB) is\u00a0pleased to provide an overview of the Company's key 2024 achievements and outline its aggressive 2025 growth strategy for its 100% owned True North gold project and the surrounding Rice Lake property in southeastern Manitoba, Canada . 2024 Highlights: Successfully delivered an updated NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate for True North, which outlined an underground indicated mineral resource of 3.5 million tonnes (Mt) at 4.41 grams per tonne (g/t) Gold (Au) containing 499,000 ounces (oz) Au and an inferred mineral resource of 5.5Mt at 3.65 g/t Au containing 644,000 oz Au. This update highlighted the robustness of this high-grade gold system and provides a solid foundation for the current exploration and development of the True North gold project. Strengthened the board and management team with key personnel appointments with proven track records in the mining industry, including Gary O'Connor as Executive Chair, and Michele Della Libera as Vice President, Exploration. Other key appointments to the Board in 2024 included Blair Schultz and Anna Ladd-Kruger . Closed an oversubscribed financing for $7.8 million in December 2024 , led by a strategic corporate investor and at a significant premium to the Company's share price, securing the capital required to advance the 2025 exploration program. Commenced the Company's first-ever drill program within the mine lease, with the initial plan for 6,000 metres (m) of diamond drilling underway to test several significant near-mine targets the new geology team identified based on the updated geological model. Identified new resource targets and resource expansion areas at True North to be the focus of drilling in 2025 and commenced studies to build a development plan for True North. Expanded the 2025 exploration drill program to over 25,000 m . Completed the review of the Ogama-Rockland mineral resource estimate, located within the southeast area of the Rice Lake belt. 2025 Outlook: The 2025 exploration program will be focused on aggressively targeting the mineral resource expansion potential at True North, identifying new high-grade zones within the mining lease and greater Rice Lake gold belt, and advancing the development of a district-scale gold camp centred on the True North complex. Figure 1: Exploration Drilling Targets Within the True North Mine Footprint (CNW Group/1911 Gold Corporation) True North Gold Project - 2025 Exploration and Development Plans Surface Exploration Drilling: 1911 Gold is currently expanding the surface diamond drilling within the mining lease area . This program will focus on testing the down-plunge and along-strike extensions of new, significant targets identified ( Figure 1 ) from the updated geological model and results from the drill program currently underway, as well as the expansion potential of the new mineral resource estimate. Underground Exploration Drilling: The Company has identified significant resource expansion potential and new resource target areas at depth within the True North lease area and has commenced work on opening access for cost-effective underground drilling of targets. Once access is established, an underground exploration drill program will commence. Continue to de-risk the redevelopment of the underground mine to finalize a plan to recommence production utilizing new development and operating methods tailored to the True North deposit, building the foundation for future production within the mine lease. Story Continues Figure 2: Central Manitoba Location Map with Surface Assays (CNW Group/1911 Gold Corporation) Rice Lake Property - District-Scale Exploration Strategy 1911 Gold holds a dominant 61,647-hectare land position in the prolific Rice Lake greenstone belt. The Company will leverage the infrastructure at True North to unlock the value of the known high-grade gold deposits on the property. Outside of the mining lease, the Company will advance the following project areas in 2025: Central Manitoba : The Company is evaluating the historical results at Central Manitoba and preparing a follow-up drill program on targets defined within this prospective target, as well as the 5-kilometre structure connecting to the historic producer at Gunnar. The historical Central Manitoba mine, located within this trend ( Figure 2 ), is the second-largest historical producer in the Rice Lake district, with among the highest head grades (12.60 g/t Au) and total gold production of 160,000 oz. Ogama Rockland: With the model review now complete, 1911 Gold will look for opportunities to expand the existing gold resource at Ogama Rockland. Shaun Heinrichs , President and CEO of 1911 Gold commented: \"2024 was a pivotal year for 1911 Gold with the delivery of a new mineral resource estimate, the commencement of 1911's first-ever drill program within the existing mine lease area, and the completion of a strategic financing led by a new corporate investor. Building on this success, our 2025 exploration and development plans are fully funded and designed to aggressively grow the resource potential at True North and advance the project toward production. With one drill rig currently turning and another planned soon, we aim to drill at least 15,000 m in 2025, making it a truly transformative year for 1911 Gold. We have the team, the assets, and the capital to deliver on our objective of building a multi-million-ounce, high-grade gold camp at True North.\" Grant of Stock Options and Restricted Share Units The Company announces that, pursuant to the Company's Long-Term Incentive Plan (the \"LTIP\"), a total of 5,700,000 incentive stock options have been issued to directors, officers, employees, and consultants.
