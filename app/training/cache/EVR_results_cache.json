[{"text": "Evercore (EVR) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy? Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 6:00 PM 4 min read In This Article: EVR -2.79% Evercore (EVR) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price. The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This investment bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.90 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +43.6%. Revenues are expected to be $869.15 million, up 10.8% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.07% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change. Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Story Continues Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Evercore? For Evercore, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%. On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3. So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Evercore will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue? While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Evercore would post earnings of $1.95 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.04, delivering a surprise of +4.62%. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times. Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Evercore doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

{"text": "Best Investment Banks To Work For In 2025 Jeff Schmitt Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 7:45 PM 20 min read In This Article: MC -0.91% EVR -2.79% PJT +0.22% What do people associate with investment banking? Jamie Dimon. Vampire Squid. Bloomberg. Booms-and-busts. Wall Street and Square Mile. Complicated algorithms and glorious slide decks. Seven-figure paychecks too. Here, the dream is to \u2018Get rich and get out\u2019 \u2013 because you\u2019re only as good as your last deal. To most, banking is a burnout job \u2013 no break, no balance, no life. Fierce competition, crushing workloads, and never-ending deadlines \u2013 an unrelenting pressure to be a Master of the Universe. In the bigger picture, is that any way to live? SIXTH TIME IS THE CHARM That\u2019s exactly the question being asked in banking: wealth or health? You\u2019ll find some of the answers in the Vault Banking 25 . An annual survey conducted since 2007, the Vault Banking 25 surveys banking professionals on the measures that matter most to them. Forget KPIs like assets-to-liabilities, AUM growth, and net profit. Instead, bankers weigh in on dimensions like benefits, hours, training, compensation, and leadership. For the 6th consecutive year, Centerview Partners has remained the best place to work according to bankers themselves. On a 10-point index, Centerview Partners averaged a 9.035 index score, over .10 of a point higher than the previous year. \u00a0Evercore scored an 8.635 average to hold onto the #2 spot, with Moelis & Company again rounding out the top three at 8.221. However, the Vault Banking 25 is poised for a shake-up as PJT Partners and Perella Weinberg Partners each climbed three spots to rank 4th and 5th respectively. VAULT BANKING 25 METHODOLOGY The ranking was compiled by Vault , an intelligence resource that collects employee reviews to provide rankings and in-depth company profiles in areas like law, consulting, banking, accounting, and internships. In addition, Vault provides expert career advice across 14 blogs and over 100 career guides. Among the blogs, Vault covers areas ranging from graduate school to negotiation strategies, while the guides include behavioral interviews, industry-specific jobs, and legal practice areas. In the 2025 banking survey, which was conducted last fall, Vault received roughly 2,800 responses \u2013 or approximately 400 more than the previous year\u2019s sample. To rate employers, Vault applies a 10-point scale, with 10 being the highest possible score. In the survey, respondents are asked to rate their employer across 20 work-life and 6 diversity dimensions (with the latter not factored into Vault\u2019s rankings formula). Like previous years, Firm Culture accounts for a 20% weight, followed by Compensation (10%), Business Outlook (10%), Overall Satisfaction (10%), Work-Life Balance (5%), and Formal and Informal Training (5%). The remaining 40% is devoted to Firm Prestige. Unlike the Work-Life dimensions, where respondents rated their own employers, survey-takers scored the Prestige of competitors with whom they have interacted. Overall, the Vault Banking 25 surveyed professionals from 85 firms, excluding firms that had fewer than 15 responses in any question from the ranking dimension. Story Continues CENTERVIEW ACHIEVES TOP SCORE IN 90% OF WORK-LIFE DIMENSIONS Based in New York City, Centerview Partners is an advisory firm that\u2019s home to over 600 employees. In recent years, Centerview Partners has led or advised on M&A deals that have included PepsiCo, Merck, UBS, L\u2019Or\u00e9al Group, Pfizer, AstraZenca, Oracle, and Blackstone. What sets the firm apart in the Vault 25 Banking Ranking? Think all-around excellence, particularly in pay, culture, work, ad talent. Among the 20 dimensions rated by Vault, Centerview Partners produced the highest average score in 18 of them. That includes every weighed work-life dimension weighed in the ranking except Formal Training (2.5%). In other words, Centerview Partners survey respondents gave their employer the highest marks in the following dimensions: Benefits, Business Outlook, Client Interaction, Compensation, Culture, ESG Practices, Firm Leadership, Hiring Process, Hours, Informal Training, Internal Mobility, Promotion Policies, Quality of Work, Relationships with Managers, Satisfaction, Vacation Policies, Wellness, and Work/Life Balance. What\u2019s more, Centerview Partners climbed to #1 over the past year in Client Interaction and Vacation Policies. \u201cYou work hard, as with all positions within the industry, but you are rewarded with interesting, thought-provoking work in the most complicated situations,\u201d writes one Vault survey-taker. \u201cCenterview is on the forefront of industry-defining transactions across both M&A and restructuring. People genuinely care about your well-being and development, in and outside of the office.\u201d Wall Street pay THE PERKS OF BEING #1 Certainly, Centerview\u2019s perks are market-setters. Picture a caf\u00e9 with an in-house chef providing free breakfasts, lunches, and dinners. There is an on-site gym and internal sports teams. Ubers are free too \u2013 and there is a barista on staff to make the richest coffees.\u00a0 And then there is the pay\u2026 \u201cPay is top of Street by a long shot,\u201d adds another survey respondent. Career development is another differentiator at Centerview Partners. One survey-taker points out that Centerview University trainings and homework are \u201cgraded personally by bankers within the firm.\u201d Another staffer points to the firm\u2019s emphasis on developing homegrown talent through formal mentorship programs, ongoing training, and thoughtful staffing. In other words, Centerview Partners embodies a coaching culture that invests heavily in new talent, expecting them to eventually grow into difference-makers and partners. \u201cA very high level of responsibility is given to team members who are keen to develop their skillset,\u201d according to one Centerview survey respondent. \u201cGiven the teams are small, team members are often given the opportunity to step up and play the role of senior members on the team.\u201d HIGH PERFORMANCE AND HIGH PRESTIGE More than anything, Centerview bankers are bullish on the future. One anonymous respondent observes that \u201cmorale is through the roof,\u201d adding that the firm\u2019s secret weapons are banking fundamentals: \u201cgenuine business insights and flawless execution of deals.\u201d This confidence \u2013 coupled with an expectation of excellence \u2013 permeates the firm top-to-bottom,\u201d adds another survey-taker. \u201cWe have a suite of industry-leading senior bankers with proven abilities to lead the Street across several industries (biotech, healthcare services, consumer, special committee, etc.). Also, senior hires focused on geopolitical expertise has been highly tactical and will continue to become a larger and larger piece of the puzzle for independent advisors. There are lots of tools that Centerview is equipped with that are difficult for the competition to replicate, especially the larger players.\u201d Competing firms are equally upbeat on Centerview Partners\u2019 prospects. The firm achieved the second-highest score in Firm Prestige at 8.328, up .210 of a point over the previous year. At the same time, it narrowed the Prestige gap with Goldman Sachs to .448 of a point \u2013 a difference that was .773 of a point just two years ago. Wall Street EVERCORE DEFINED BY TALENT DEVELOPMENT Evercore again holds down the #2 spot in the Vault Banking 25. Like previous years, Evrecore posted the highest score in the Formal Training dimension. By the same token, Evercore ranked 2nd for both Business Outlook and Hiring Process and Top 5 in 8 other dimensions. The firm also finished 4th in the all-important Prestige dimension, representing a .155 uptick in the process. Among the firm\u2019s marquee attractions, say Vault survey respondents, is the work-life balance. One respondent observes that bankers can work from home on evenings. Even more, Evercore places greater emphasis on work over political considerations like \u2018face time.\u2019 \u201c[The] best aspect is that quality of life is a major focus of our group,\u201d explains one survey respondent. \u201cWeekend hours are audited, and senior members of teams are held accountable if it seems that junior teams have been working unnecessarily\u2026We also respect protected Saturdays (which is enforced, subject to explicit client needs). Individuals are encouraged to take vacation, and teams provide robust coverage so that they are uninterrupted. Our group is very busy, but that has nothing to do with the culture or institution of our group itself; it\u2019s just a testament to the group\u2019s ability to generate high quality work.\u201d Like Centerview Partners, Evercore also emphasizes an apprenticeship culture where senior bankers devote heavy time to developing younger talent. One survey-taker reveals that he is being \u201cactively mentored by multiple senior leaders in the firm,\u201d along with \u201cwork[ing] directly with VPs, MDs, and Senior MDs on deal teams\u201d In a similar fashion, Evercore delivers intensive formal training, with new hires completing a month-long program before they are ever put on the desk. \u201cEvercore has a top training program that equips its incoming analysts with all the skills necessary to succeed.,\u201d adds another Vault respondent from the firm. \u201cThis is in part because the training is specifically designed for Evercore instead of an off-the-shelf training program. Evercore teams also host plenty of networking and mentorship opportunities between junior and seniors. As an intern, I had a 1-on-1 with our chairman and with our global head of investment banking. Such exposure is hard to find anywhere else on the Street.\u201d Next Page: Prestige and Diversity Rankings Plus Access to Full Rankings New York City ACROSS-THE-BOARD EXCELLENCE AT MOELIS The top three is rounded out by Moelis & Company, which most recently advised Spirit AeroSystems during its $8.3 billion dollar acquisition by Boeing. This year, the firm ranked 2nd across 9 dimensions: Firm Leadership, Hours, Internal Mobility, Promotion Policies, Quality of Work, Relationships with Managers, Satisfaction, Wellness, and Work/Life Balance. That doesn\u2019t count ranking Top 5 in another 8 dimensions, including 3rd for Business Outlook and Culture. So why didn\u2019t Moelis & Company overtake Evercore this cycle? Simple: Moelis again ranked 8th in Prestige. On the surface. Moelis & Company may seem to be at a disadvantage in Compensation, where it ranked 5th. However, the firm\u2019s support goes well beyond a paycheck. One survey-taker cited the \u201cgenerous 401K match\u201d and added that maternity leave was longer than peer firms. Another praised the mental health coverage, with Moelis picking up the tab for 12 therapy session. That\u2019s just the start. \u201cWe truly have an incredible compensation package here at Moelis. We are given comprehensive benefits that extend beyond that of the average offering,\u201d explains one survey-taker. \u201cThe Moelis package includes medical, dental, vision, and basic life/AD&D insurance, as well as the option to open an HSA (Health Savings Account), enroll with a virtual doctor through Teladoc, and, last but absolutely not least, sign up for Lyra Health, where you are connected with a mental health professional to navigate your emotions and work on developing plans to grow!\u201d Even more, Moelis is considered safe and stable according to one Vault respondent, noting the firm \u201c[isn\u2019t] as susceptible to public market swings or as exposed to external risks\u201d being strictly an advisory firm. That said, another banker mentioned that the firm wasn\u2019t resting on its laurels, moving into new areas like sports, gaming, and the Middle East. \u201cMoelis is trending in the right direction,\u201d adds another staffer. \u201cWe have increased our deal flow while continuing to build meaningful client relationships. We are in growth mode and have been given business opportunities to expand our portfolio and drive efficiencies.\u201d PJT PARTNERS EARNS HIGH MARKS Looking for some firms to watch? Start with PJT Partners, which moved from 7th to 5th while its index score improved from 7.797 to 8.121. Yes, PJT Partners is definitely a firm on the rise. They also made several big leaps in the rankings this year. In the Vault Banking 25, they ranked #4 this year, up from #7 last year. The firm cracked the Top 3 in the ESG Practices and Hiring Process dimensions. It has also continued its slow climb up in Prestige, moving from 8th to 6th in the past two years, while seeing its score improve from 6.891 to 7.182 in the past year alone. Derek Loosvelt, editorial director at Vault, pegs PJT Partners as a mover in a statement to P&Q. \u201cIn benefits, they rose to #5 from\u00a0#8. And in prestige, they rose a spot to #6 from #7. PJT Partners was spun off from Blackstone about a decade ago, and ever since, PJT Partners has been on the rise, their (new) name becoming more and more widely known.\u00a0Today, PJT Partners regularly works on some of the largest, most complex M&A deals on the Street (T-Mobile\u2019s $59 billion merger with Sprint, and Sky\u2019s $48 million sale to Comcast, to name a couple), and it treats its junior team very well. The firm\u2019s bankers particularly appreciate\u00a0the remote-work periods in August (three weeks remote), the week of\u00a0Thanksgiving, and the end of December. And they also tell us that the senior team\u00a0makes an effort to enable junior\u00a0bankers to take time off and are understanding of outside commitments and responsibilities, especially if people have young families.\u201d BANKS TO WATCH Parella Weinberg is on a similar roll, moving from 8th to 5th. One reason: the firm broke into the Top 3 in several dimensions, including Compensation, Culture, and Satisfaction, worth a combined 40% of the ranking weight. It also climbed into the Top 3 in 5 more dimensions, while slipping into the Top 10 for Prestige. \u201cIn compensation,\u00a0Perella Weinberg\u00a0rose to #2 this year from #6 last year. In culture, they ranked #2, up from #7. And in work/life balance they made their most impressive leap, rising to #4 from #13,\u201d says Loosvelt. \u201cAs for why they made such\u00a0large\u00a0leaps, Perella Weinberg\u2019s bankers told us\u00a0that the firm\u00a0now\u00a0places a strong emphasis on work/life balance and has a firmwide goal of making sure all employees use all their vacation days. They also told us that the firm is very supportive of protected weekends and\u00a0that\u00a0the benefits program is the best on the Street.\u201d Houlihan Lokey takes the honor for the biggest improvement, going from 25th to 11th, though this stemmed from the firm not qualifying for the ranking last year. According to survey-takers, Houlihan Lokey\u2019s biggest strength was Client Interaction, where it ranked 4th. Beyond that, the Vault Banking 25 was a model of stability. Lazard lost two spots, going from 4th to 6th. However, it boasted the highest score for International Opportunities (and 2nd-best for ESG Practices and Informal Training\u2026plus 3rd-best for Work-Life Balance).\u00a0 Guggenheim Securities tumbled 3 spots to 8th, though it remained a Top 3 firm for both Compensation and Formal Training. Beyond this, no firms gained or lost more than one spot, though Solomon Partners tumbled out of the Top 25, while UBS made its debut at #25. A LOOK INSIDE GOLDMAN SACHS While Prestige is a component of the Vault Banking 25 weighting system, it is also treated as a separate ranking. Here, Goldman Sachs continues to top the list according to survey respondents who compete against the firm. This year, Golden Sachs averaged 8.776 in Prestige, up .111 of a point. However, Goldman Sachs didn\u2019t participate in the quality of work and life survey responses, os it could rank no higher than 16th. Still, Vault was able to secure several survey responses from employee. In terms of compensation, the sentiment was mixed. One respondent from a previous year described Goldman Saches base pay as \u201crelatively low\u201d \u2013 but adds that \u201coverall compensation increases significantly over time.\u201d Another survey-taker was more upbeat on the package overall. \u201cSalary is very competitive, and formulaic comp means you always have a good sense of your pay. Also, how the firm does in any given year doesn\u2019t impact you, medical and 401(k) options are best-in-breed, and the on-site gym is state-of-the-art. In general, it\u2019s a healthy compensation package with good perks.\u201d When it comes to Goldman Sach\u2019s outlook, respondents seem cautiously optimistic. \u201cWe\u2019re going through lots of change, which is difficult,\u201d writes one respondent summing up the mood. \u201cNew leadership is changing the structure of the firm; time will tell how this plays out, but at this point I feel confident on our ability to deliver. The change seems purposeful, strategic, well-planned, and provides an exciting and bright future.\u201d JPMorgan Chase Office. iStock photo JP MORGAN CHASE PRAISED FOR FLEXIBILITY JP Morgan Chase, which ranked 17th overall due to also not participating in the quality of work and life survey, ranked 3rd for Prestige. Among past survey respondents, career mobility is a common theme at the firm. \u201cJ.P. Morgan has a collegial culture and emphasizes mentoring of junior staff,\u201d writes one respondent. \u201cI\u2019ve been at several banks on Wall Street, and J.P. Morgan has the best/most organized training of junior staff. J.P. Morgan is also a big firm, and I\u2019ve seen employees transition from one part of the bank to another (especially if you do a solid job and have a good internal rating on performance reviews and the support of your manager). Moving within the bank to pursue an opportunity outside of your line of business is not an impossible task.\u201d As a whole, survey respondents were upbeat about JP Morgan Chase\u2019s prospects\u2026with a few caveats. \u201cOur businesses are very strong. Any setbacks will be due to the overabundance of regulatory changes\u2014which is an issue for the entire industry. We have very good leadership at our firm. My only knock is on the diversity front. We should be better, and the leadership needs to telegraph that and measure it.\u201d CENTERVIEW PARTNERS ALSO EXCELS IN DIVERSITY While diversity measures weren\u2019t baked into the Vault Banking 25 methodology, they remained a strength for Centerview Partners. The firm achieved the highest score across 5 of 6 diversity measures: Overall Diversity, LGBTQ+, Racial and Ethnic Diversity, Women, and Employees with Disabilities. It also finished 2nd among Military Veterans. According to one Vault survey-taker, the firm maintains several employee resource groups, including one for first generation employees. Another respondent praises the firm for its inclusive recruiting practices. And a third employee brought up Centerview Partners\u2019 efforts to retain underrepresented groups. \u201cAt the junior level, for example, it is often the case that analyst classes have more females than males. Military veteran hiring in the U.S. office is very strong\u2014and some very strong employees in the U.S. office have military backgrounds.\u201d HOURS ARE OVERRATED Alongside the ranking, Vault also identified several themes in banking. For one, bankers have been disappointed with many of their employers\u2019 back-to-work mandates, preferring a more hybrid model. In some cases, this dissatisfaction stems from a double-standard according to one survey respondent. \u201cWhile we talk about work/life balance, many leaders don\u2019t follow that narrative. We have a culture of \u2018in the office,\u2019 which is a problem and doesn\u2019t support quality of life balances, as it requires employees to commute long hours, pay pricey parking fees, and spend less time with their families.\u201d Alas, banking is an industry where top performers come in with red eyes and live off Red Bulls. In a surprise, Vault found many several survey-takers didn\u2019t mind grinding through grueling hours and intense spikes. The difference between drudgery and delight, however, was rooted in the fundamentals: pay, support, and pause. \u201cThe hours can be long, the deadlines tight, and schedules get blown up,\u201d muses one respondent, \u201cbut your team always has your back and once the crisis is past, staffing and senior leadership work diligently to make sure you get a break to recover.\u201d WHY BANKING IS ON THE UPSWING In five years, banking may be far beyond the long hours in the office debate. This week, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon told attendees at the Cisco AI Summit that Artificial Intelligence could write 95% of an IPO prospectus \u2013 and handle it in a few minutes. Does that mean investment banking could be a lean operation in the future? For Vault\u2019s Derek Loosvelt, the bigger question is what students and young students can do now to be indispensable in the wake of AI\u2019s growth. \u201cAI is impacting every industry and every role,\u201d he tells P&Q . \u201cIn banking and finance, what\u2019s important right now for professionals and students to do is not to try to predict which roles will be obsolete but to develop expertise in certain AI tools, data science, machine learning, etc. This will allow current and future finance professionals to stay competitive\u00a0in the constantly changing workplace. Also, it\u2019s important for banking professionals to continue to develop their soft skills like problem-solving, teamwork, empathy, communication, leadership, and critical thinking. These and other soft skills will continue to be highly sought after. Those experienced professionals and new grads with these types of skills will be better able to adapt as AI tools continue to be rolled out.\u201d When it comes to the usual debate on whether banking is losing ground to consulting and tech in the battle for talent, Loosvelt has seen some reason for optimism in banking. \u201cWhat\u2019s probably had the largest effect are the cuts in tech. Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Intel, Cisco, and others made significant and highly publicized layoffs last year. And this certainly made choosing tech over banking less attractive. In the past decade, there\u2019s been a massive talent war for MBA grads between Silicon Valley and Wall Street, and those tech cuts were a win for Wall Street in that war. Other than that, what comes to mind is I do think the top banks are catching up with the top tech firms when it comes to offering top-notch benefits and perks.

Outlook Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 7:03 PM 4 min read In This Article: TECK -1.93% CRS -0.99% Teck Resources Limited TECK announced fourth-quarter and 2024 production and sales volumes. TECK\u2019s Production & Sales Update In the fourth quarter of 2024, Teck Resources sold 124,900 tons and produced a record 122,100 tons of copper. The company\u2019s annual copper production came in at 446,000 tons, within its guidance of 420,000-455,000 tons. The upside in production was driven by the ramp-up of Quebrada Blanca, which achieved design throughput rates by the end of 2024. Fourth-quarter 2024 sales and production of zinc came in at 204,000 tons and 146,400 tons, respectively. The annual production of 615,900 tons of zinc came within the company's expectations, driven by the higher year-over-year annual production at Red Dog. The refined zinc production for the fourth quarter of 2024 was 62,100 tons, whereas sales were 61,100 tons. The annual refined zinc production was slightly higher than the guidance at 256,600 tons. Teck Resources\u2019 Other Updates TECK sold its steelmaking coal business (\u201cEVR\u201d) in 2024 to position itself as a pure-play energy transition metals business focused on copper and zinc. Teck Resources intends to allocate proceeds from the transactions in accordance with its Capital Allocation Framework. The allocation strategy includes cash returns to shareholders, reducing debt, setting aside cash for taxes and transaction costs, and retaining funds for strategic copper projects that drive long-term value growth. In 2024, Teck Resources executed $1.25-billion from its authorized share buyback program of $3.25 billion. The company lowered its debt by $1.6 billion through a bond tender offer for public notes in July 2024 and additional debt repayments in the second half of the year. TECK\u2019s 2025 Guidance The company predicts total copper production at 490,000-565,000 tons in 2025. The total zinc concentrate production in 2025 is estimated between 525,000 and 570,000 tons. The refined zinc production is estimated at 190,000-300,000 tons for 2025. The zinc production over the next three years is likely to fall because of deteriorating grades at Red Dog. Capital expenditure in 2025 is estimated to be lower than that recorded in 2024, owing to decreased spending. Teck Resources\u2019 Stock Price Performance The company\u2019s shares have gained 16.3% in the past year against the industry\u2019s 7.8% fall.

Evercore would replace Bausch\u2019s previous investment bank, Houlihan Lokey, said some of the people, all of whom asked not to be named discussing private information. Representatives for White & Case, Proskauer and Evercore did not respond to requests for comment. Representatives for Houlihan Lokey and for Laval, Quebec-based Bausch declined to comment. In their dealings with the company, holders of much of Bausch\u2019s debt have been operating under a creditor pact that has complicated efforts to spin off or sell Bausch + Lomb, Bloomberg previously reported. Those plans were first publicized by Bausch in 2020, when the announcement sent shares soaring 18%. The Bausch creditors formed that cooperation unit to protect their rights and interests during the type of debt negotiations that have otherwise seen lenders compete against each other for deals that elevate some over others in rank and payment priority. Bausch + Lomb in December confirmed that a sale was \u201cone of several options being explored to complete a full separation from Bausch Health Companies Inc.,\u201d making the statement in response to a request for information from the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization. The Financial Times reported the same month that the private equity firm Blackstone was losing interest in making a bid for the company. It had previously reported that potential bidders included Blackstone, Advent International and TPG Capital. The trade publication Octus previously reported on Bausch hiring Proskauer Rose.

owner wants a salary cap in MLB, says the business community is hopeful under Trump Brian Sozzi \u00b7 Executive Editor Updated Sun, Jan 26, 2025, 10:18 PM 4 min read In This Article: JPM -0.18% CG -3.53% GS -1.25% ^GSPC -0.76% EVR -2.79% Baltimore Orioles owner and billionaire Carlyle Group ( CG ) co-founder David Rubenstein is hitting the yes button on a salary cap for Major League Baseball. \"I wish it would be the case that we would have a salary cap in baseball the way other sports do, and maybe eventually we will, but we don't have that now,\" Rubenstein told Yahoo Finance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"I suspect we'll probably have something closer to what the NFL and the NBA have, but there's no guarantee of that.\" The free-spending Los Angeles Dodgers barreled through the luxury tax this offseason, with a payroll estimated to exceed $370 million. It would top the payrolls of other big spenders in the New York Yankees and Philadelphia Phillies. The Baltimore Orioles payroll is in the middle of the pack in MLB at over $150 million for 2025, projected by Fangraphs . Rubenstein \u2014 who purchased the team as part of a consortium for $1.725 billion \u2014 says he will up the team's payroll and is renovating its home ballpark Camden Yards. However, he says a larger discussion needs to happen to close the gap between big- and small-market teams. \"I think the big city teams have some advantages. Now, in Los Angeles, they have another advantage. They have Japanese players, [a] number of them that they got like Shohei [Ohtani], and people in Japan really love watching the Dodgers, and they sell a lot of merchandise in Japan for Dodgers players,\" explained Rubenstein. On the business front, Rubenstein is hopeful on the outlook under President Trump. \"I think the business community does generally feel optimistic about what the Trump administration is likely to do. That's not to say that the Biden administration didn't do some things that were very good for business, but clearly this administration is seen by the business community as much more sympathetic, rightly or wrongly,\" Rubenstein said. Enthusiasm over potential Trump policies have some on the Street concerned stocks are overvalued. Unknowns include the end result for Trump's tariff threats and the outlook for Fed policy. Stocks are \"priced for perfection,\" warned Goldman Sachs strategist Peter Oppenheimer this month . Oppenheimer said the outlook for stocks in the near term is complicated. \"First, the speed of the recent rises in stock prices has reflected much of the good news that we are expecting on growth. Second, high valuations are likely to limit forward returns. Third, unusually high market concentration increases portfolio risks: concentration has increased by geography (the US has been increasingly dominant), by sector (technology has generated the bulk of equity returns), and by stock (the five biggest stocks in the US account for roughly a quarter of the index),\" Oppenheimer explained.

Today, the private equity powerhouse boasts more than $447 billion in assets under management across three business segments and 612 investment vehicles.

Rubenstein, a former aide to President Jimmy Carter, has become a noted philanthropist along the way and has signed the Giving Pledge . President Joe Biden awarded Rubenstein the Presidential Medal of Freedom earlier this month. Says Rubenstein on Biden's presidential legacy, \"I don't think the president's legacy will be completely seen for quite some time, but I think in time, people think that he had the right ideas about many things, and that he was a very good transition president.\" \u2014 Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Article: TCKRF -4.41% TECK -1.93% Teck Resources Ltd VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Jan. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Teck Resources Limited (TSX: TECK.A and TECK.B, NYSE: TECK) (\u201cTeck\u201d) today provided select unaudited fourth quarter 2024 production and sales volumes, annual production volumes for 2024, as well as operational and capital guidance for 2025 and production guidance for 2026 to 2028. Our fourth quarter 2024 financial results are scheduled for release on February 20, 2025. Overview of 2024 Teck underwent a significant portfolio transformation in 2024, repositioning itself as a pure-play energy transition metals business focused on Copper and Zinc. During 2024, we completed the sale of 23% of the steelmaking coal business, EVR, to Nippon Steel Corporation and POSCO for upfront proceeds of US$1.3 billion and the remaining 77% of EVR to Glencore for proceeds of US$7.3 billion. Upon closing of the transactions, we announced our intention to allocate the transaction proceeds consistent with our Capital Allocation Framework. This included total cash returns to shareholders of $3.5 billion, a debt reduction program of up to $2.75 billion, approximately $1.0 billion for final taxes and transaction costs and cash retained for our value accretive copper projects. Given the completion of the sale of EVR on July 11, 2024, we have removed steelmaking coal business unit information from our 2024 production results in this guidance update. In 2024, we executed $1.25 billion of our authorized share buyback program of $3.25 billion. We also reduced our debt by US$1.6 billion through a bond tender offer for our public notes in July and other debt repayments in the second half of 2024. We continued to advance our value accretive copper growth strategy, reinforcing our commitment to long-term value creation through a balanced approach of growth investments and shareholder returns. We have a pathway to grow copper production to approximately 800,000 tonnes per year before the end of the decade, with planned attributable post-sanction project capital expenditures of between US$3.2 to $3.9 billion to develop four key near-term copper projects: Quebrada Blanca (QB) optimization and debottlenecking (Teck 60% owner, Chile) \u2013 low capital intensity option to potentially increase throughput at QB by a further 15-25% (US$100-200 million estimated attributable capital cost). Highland Valley Copper Mine Life Extension (Teck 100% owner, Canada) \u2013 lower complexity brownfield project extending the life of Canada\u2019s largest copper mine to mid-2040s. Estimated life-of-mine copper production of 137,000 tonnes per annum post-2024 (US$1.3-1.4 billion estimated attributable capital). Zafranal Project (Teck 80% owner, Peru) \u2013 long life, competitive capital cost and lower complexity copper-gold project, SEIA approval received and positioned for a potential sanction decision in H2 2025. Estimated copper production of 126,000 tonnes per annum over the first five years with substantial gold by-product credits (US$1.5-1.8 billion estimated attributable capital). San Nicol\u00e1s Project (Teck 50% owner, Mexico) \u2013 low capital intensity, lower complexity copper-zinc project in well-established mining jurisdiction in partnership with Agnico Eagle Mines. Estimated production (on 100% basis) of 63,000 tonnes per annum of copper and 147,000 tonnes per annum of zinc in the first five years. Feasibility study and execution strategy are progressing towards a potential sanction decision in H2 2025 (Teck estimated funding requirement US$0.3-0.5 billion). Story Continues 2024 Production Results The table below shows a summary of Teck\u2019s share of unaudited production and sales of principal products for the fourth quarter of 2024, and 2024 annual production as compared to our previously disclosed guidance as of October 23, 2024. 2024 annual copper production of 446,000 tonnes increased by 50% compared to the prior year primarily due to the ramp-up of QB, which achieved design throughput rates by the end of the year. Record quarterly copper production of 122,100 tonnes in Q4, increased by 19% compared to the same period in 2023, with QB contributing 60,700 tonnes. Copper sales volumes from QB of 66,400 tonnes were higher than production volumes in the fourth quarter as inventory levels decreased. 2024 annual zinc in concentrate production of 615,900 tonnes decreased by 4% compared to the prior year, as anticipated in our mine plan, primarily due to a higher proportion of copper-only ore relative to copper-zinc ore at Antamina. This was largely offset by an increase of 3% in annual production at Red Dog, with 555,600 tonnes produced. 2024 annual refined zinc production of 256,000 tonnes was 4% lower than the prior year, as a result of a localized fire in the electrolytic zinc plant at Trail on September 24, 2024, which impacted production in the fourth quarter, as previously disclosed.

Guidance Our production, unit cost and capital expenditure guidance for 2025, and annual production guidance for 2026-2028 are outlined in the tables below. The guidance ranges below reflect our operating plans, which include known risks and uncertainties. Events such as extreme weather, unplanned or extended operational shut-downs and other disruptions could impact actual results beyond these estimates. Our unit costs are calculated based on production guidance volumes and variances from estimated production ranges will impact unit costs. Our disclosed guidance ranges for capital expenditures do not include post-sanction capital expenditures for the unsanctioned near-term growth projects, noted above. Our disclosed production guidance ranges also do not include the production associated with these unsanctioned projects. Guidance will be updated at the time a sanction decision is made. We remain highly focused on managing our controllable operating expenditures. Our underlying key mining drivers such as strip ratios and haul distances remain relatively stable. Inflation on key input costs, including the cost of certain key supplies and mining equipment, labour and contractors, and changing diesel prices, are included in our 2025 annual capital expenditure, capitalized stripping and unit cost guidance. Our unit cost guidance for 2025 reflects actions taken across our operations to reduce costs, embedding our management operating system across our operations to improve consistency and efficiency. As a result of structural cost reductions across our business, we expect our 2025 general and administration and research and innovation costs to decrease by approximately 15% and 35%, respectively, compared to 2024. This excludes investment in the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system across the company, which we expect to commence in 2025. This will be a multi-year program and capital costs associated with this investment for the first year are included in our 2025 guidance, outlined below. Certain costs associated with the ERP implementation will be expensed. Based on our current elevated cash and cash equivalents balance resulting from the receipt of proceeds from the sale of the steelmaking coal business, we expect to have higher investment interest income for the foreseeable future. Production Guidance The table below shows Teck\u2019s share of unaudited production of our principal products in 2024 and our guidance for 2025 and the next three years.

Copper net cash unit costs include adjusted cash cost of sales and smelter processing charges, less cash margins for by-products including co-products. Guidance for 2025 assumes a zinc price of US$1.25 per pound, a molybdenum price of US$20 per pound, a silver price of US$30 per ounce, a gold price of US$2,400 per ounce, a Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate of $1.40 and a Chilean Peso/U.S. dollar exchange rate of 950. Zinc unit costs are reported in U.S. dollars per payable pound of metal contained in concentrate. Zinc net cash unit costs are mine costs including adjusted cash cost of sales and smelter processing charges, less cash margins for by-products. Guidance for 2025 assumes a lead price of US$0.95 per pound, a silver price of US$30 per ounce and a Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate of $1.40. By-products include both by-products and co-products. After co-product and by-product margins. This is a non-GAAP financial measure or ratio. See \u201cUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Ratios\u201d for further information. Copper Total copper production in 2025 is expected to increase to between 490,000 and 565,000 tonnes compared to 446,000 tonnes produced in 2024. Through Q4 2024, QB achieved design throughput rates, saw an improvement in recoveries, and coupled with an increase in grade, resulted in a record quarterly production. This resulted in total production in 2024 of 207,800 tonnes. Our 2025 annual QB production is expected to increase to between 230,000 to 270,000 tonnes, which is 10,000 tonnes lower than our previously disclosed guidance. We had scheduled planned maintenance in January 2025 for minor modifications; however, we extended the scheduled shutdown to conduct maintenance and reliability work, and complete additional tailings lifts as part of the operational ramp up. As a result, production was halted for approximately half of January and is expected to recommence this week. We have adjusted our guidance range to account for the additional downtime. As previously noted, although we expect an overall increase in ore grades in 2025 over 2024, we expect to mine in lower grade areas in the first quarter of 2025, in line with the scheduled mine plan. Our previously disclosed production guidance for 2026-2027 remains unchanged at 280,000 to 310,000 tonnes. Annual production for 2028 is expected to be between 270,000 to 300,000 tonnes, in line with expected grade variation in the mine plan. The QB debottlenecking project, outlined above, could lead to a further increase in throughput by 10-15%, with associated production increases dependent on ore feed grade and recoveries. The results of the QB debottlenecking project are not reflected in our disclosed production guidance ranges. Highland Valley Copper production is expected to increase significantly in 2025 as mining continues in the Lornex pit, releasing ore which is both higher grade (more metal) and softer (higher mill throughput). These factors combined will more than offset expected lower recovery rates associated with the Lornex ore. Our expected recovery rates have been adjusted, and as a result, our 2025 annual production is expected to be between 135,000 and 150,000 tonnes. Our previously disclosed 2026 and 2027 annual production guidance is unchanged, and our 2028 annual production guidance is expected to be between 70,000 and 90,000 tonnes. Our disclosed production guidance does not include HVC MLE, which could be sanctioned in 2025. As a result, our 2028 annual production guidance reflects production at the end of mine life of HVC. If the project is sanctioned, production guidance would be updated at that time. Our share (22.5%) of copper production at Antamina will remain relatively stable over the next few years and our previously disclosed annual production guidance for 2025 and 2027 is unchanged, with a slight increase to annual production guidance in 2026. Annual production guidance for 2028 is outlined in the table above. Carmen de Andacollo continues to operate in extreme drought conditions. In 2024, risk mitigation plans to increase water availability through increased well field capacity were implemented, enabling mill throughput rates consistent with our mine plan through the second half of 2024. However, ongoing drought conditions remain a risk to production, which is reflected in our annual production guidance for 2025 to 2028. Our 2025 copper net cash unit costs 1 , including QB, are expected to be between US$1.65\u2013$1.95 per pound, a significant reduction from our 2024 net cash unit cost guidance of US$1.90\u2013$2.30 per pound, reflecting strong cost discipline across our operations. We expect a reduction in our operating expenses across our copper business unit compared to 2024 as QB operations stabilize and we embed our management operating system across our operations, with a focus on efficiency and cost optimization. The improvement in our 2025 copper net cash unit costs 1 compared to 2024 guidance reflects reduced operating costs across our business, an increase in copper production, lower copper treatment and refining charges and higher by-product credits, which are largely driven by an increase in molybdenum production at QB and Highland Valley Copper. In 2025, QB net cash unit costs 1 are expected to be between US$1.80\u2013$2.15 per pound, a significant reduction from our 2024 QB net cash unit cost 1 guidance of US$2.25\u2013$2.55 per pound. The improvement in QB net cash unit costs 1 is primarily due to an increase in copper production and higher molybdenum by-product credits, but also reflects completion of ramp-up and the expected stabilization of QB operations through 2025. Zinc Total zinc in concentrate production in 2025 is expected to be between 525,000 and 575,000 tonnes, compared to 615,900 tonnes in 2024. Production in each of the next three years is expected to decrease primarily due to declining grades at Red Dog. Red Dog is expected to produce between 430,000 and 470,000 tonnes of zinc in 2025, compared to 555,600 tonnes in 2024, primarily due to a decline in zinc grades. We are currently mining in two pits, Aqqaluk and Qanaiyaq, with the latter to be depleted midway through 2025 as per the mine plan. As the Qanaiyaq pit nears the end of life, we have seen an increase in ore tonnes in Qanaiyaq, but at lower average zinc grades compared to what was previously expected, leading to a decrease in our 2025 annual zinc production guidance. Our previously disclosed 2026 and 2027 annual production guidance is unchanged and 2028 annual production guidance reflects declining zinc grades as the Aqqaluk pit nears the end of mine life. We are advancing studies to extend the life of the operation, having commenced construction of an all-season access road to more efficiently drill the nearby Anarraaq and Aktigiruq deposits, which are critical to the extension of the mine life of Red Dog. Our share (22.5%) of zinc production at Antamina is expected to be between 95,000 and 105,000 tonnes in 2025, consistent with our previously disclosed guidance. Based on Antamina\u2019s mine plan, 2025 is expected to see a higher proportion of copper-zinc ore relative to copper-only ore compared to 2024. Annual zinc production between 2026 and 2028 is expected to be lower than 2025, as we expect more copper-only ore relative to copper-zinc ore, consistent with the mine plan. Refined zinc production at our Trail Operations is expected to be between 190,000 and 230,000 tonnes in 2025, compared to 256,000 tonnes in 2024. To maximize value from our Trail Operations, in light of the current tightness in the zinc concentrate market and aligned with our focus on improving its profitability and cash generation, we expect to reduce our zinc production at Trail in 2025, as reflected in our 2025 annual production guidance. We will continue to operate Trail, albeit at lower production rates, and remain focused on implementing a range of initiatives to further improve cash generation. The repair of one of the four sections of the electrolytic plant impacted by a fire in the third quarter of 2024 continues to progress and is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2025. Our annual 2025 production guidance does not require usage of all sections of the electrolytic plant. Our annual production guidance of 260,000 to 300,000 tonnes for 2026\u20132028 assumes a return to full production levels, consistent with the capacity of our Trail Operations, subject to market conditions and optimizing for value and financial outcomes. Our 2025 zinc net cash unit costs 1 are expected to be US$0.45 \u2013$0.55 per pound, consistent with our 2024 annual guidance, despite a reduction in annual zinc in concentrate production expected in 2025. Our 2025 zinc net cash unit costs 1 are expected to remain consistent year over year despite lower zinc production. The decrease in zinc production is offset by lower zinc treatment charges, higher by-product credits, and continued focus on efficiency and cost optimization. Capital Expenditure Guidance Our 2025 capital expenditures are expected to decrease from our 2024 guidance levels following completion of construction of the QB2 project in 2024. This decrease is expected to be partially offset by capital expenditures to progress our near-term copper growth strategy. The capital required for our near-term growth projects, noted above, is dependent on the timing of permit approvals and completion of studies and detailed engineering work prior to potential sanction decisions. Post-sanction expenditures are not included in our capital expenditure guidance below for 2025 and our share of estimated post-sanction total attributable capital for these projects is noted above. Our 2025 sustaining capital and capitalized stripping expenditures are expected to be between $1.0\u2013$1.2 billion, in line with our previously disclosed guidance for our current portfolio of operating assets. Sustaining capital expenditure in 2025 is expected to be between $750\u2013$845 million, of which $600\u2013670 million relates to our copper business and $150\u2013175 million relates to our zinc business. Capitalized stripping costs in 2025 are expected to be between $260\u2013300 million. Our 2025 growth capital expenditure guidance for copper primarily relates to our near-term copper growth projects \u2013 HVC MLE, Zafranal and San Nicol\u00e1s \u2013 and is focused on completing feasibility studies, and advancing detailed engineering work, project execution planning, and permitting. The advancement of engineering and execution planning for these projects through 2025 is expected to increase our growth capital expenditures, excluding QB, compared to 2024. In addition, we will work towards operational optimization at QB, which will inform our low capital-intensity debottlenecking project at QB. Growth capital expenditure guidance for 2025 does not include post-sanction project capital, which would be disclosed at the time of sanctioning. We also expect to continue to progress our medium to long-term portfolio options with prudent investments to advance the path to value. Our 2025 growth capital expenditure guidance for zinc primarily relates to the construction of an all-season access road at Red Dog to more efficiently drill the Anarraaq and Aktigiruq deposits, thus progressing the potential for mine life extension.

This document refers to a number of non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios, which are not measures recognized under IFRS Accounting Standards and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS Accounting Standards or by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios described below do not have standardized meanings under IFRS Accounting Standards, may differ from those used by other issuers, and may not be comparable to similar financial measures and ratios reported by other issuers. These financial measures and ratios have been derived from our financial statements and applied on a consistent basis as appropriate. We disclose these financial measures and ratios because we believe they assist readers in understanding the results of our operations and financial position and provide further information about our financial results to investors. These measures should not be considered in isolation or used as a substitute for other measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards. For more information on our use of non-GAAP financial measures and ratios, see the section titled \u201c Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Ratios \u201d in our most recent Management Discussion Analysis, which is available on SEDAR+ ( www.sedarplus.ca ). Additional information on certain non-GAAP ratios is below. Total cash unit costs \u2013 Total cash unit costs for our copper and zinc operations includes adjusted cash costs of sales, as described below, plus the smelter and refining charges added back in determining adjusted revenue. This presentation allows a comparison of total cash unit costs, including smelter charges, to the underlying price of copper or zinc in order to assess the margin for the mine on a per unit basis. Net cash unit costs \u2013 Net cash unit costs of principal product, after deducting co-product and by-product margins, are also a common industry measure. By deducting the co- and by-product margin per unit of the principal product, the margin for the mine on a per unit basis may be presented in a single metric for comparison to other operations. Adjusted cash cost of sales \u2013 Adjusted cash cost of sales for our copper and zinc operations is defined as the cost of the product delivered to the port of shipment, excluding depreciation and amortization charges, any one-time collective agreement charges or inventory write-down provisions and by-product cost of sales. It is common practice in the industry to exclude depreciation and amortization, as these costs are non-cash, and discounted cash flow valuation models used in the industry substitute expectations of future capital spending for these amounts. Cash margins for by-products \u2013 Cash margins for by-products is revenue from by- and co-products, less any associated cost of sales of the by- and co-product. In addition, for our copper operations, by-product cost of sales also includes cost recoveries associated with our streaming transactions. Total cash unit costs per pound \u2013Total cash unit costs per pound is a non-GAAP ratio comprised of adjusted cash cost of sales divided by payable pounds sold plus smelter processing charges divided by payable pounds sold. Net cash unit costs per pound \u2013 Net cash unit costs per pound is a non-GAAP ratio comprised of (adjusted cash cost of sales plus smelter processing charges less cash margin for by-products) divided by payable pounds sold. There is no similar financial measure in our consolidated financial statements with which to compare. Adjusted cash cost of sales is a non-GAAP financial measure. Cash margins for by-products per pound \u2013 Cash margins for by-products per pound is a non-GAAP ratio comprised of cash margins for by-products divided by payable pounds sold.

Assumptions regarding QB operations and the QB2 project include current ramp-up assumptions and assumptions contained in the final feasibility study, as well as there being no further unexpected material and negative impact to operations or provision of goods and services as anticipated. Assumptions regarding the costs and benefits of our projects include assumptions that the relevant project is sanctioned, constructed, commissioned, and operated in accordance with current expectations. Expectations regarding our operations are based on numerous assumptions regarding continued operation in line with current expectations. Our Guidance tables include disclosure and footnotes with further assumptions relating to our guidance, and assumptions for certain other forward-looking statements accompany those statements within the document. Statements concerning future production costs or volumes are based on numerous assumptions regarding operating matters and on assumptions that demand for products develops as anticipated, that customers and other counterparties perform their contractual obligations, that operating and capital plans will not be disrupted by issues such as mechanical failure, unavailability of parts and supplies, labour disturbances, interruption in transportation or utilities, adverse weather conditions, or social unrest, and that there are no material unanticipated variations in the cost of energy or supplies. The foregoing list of assumptions is not exhaustive. Events or circumstances could cause actual results to vary materially. Factors that may cause actual results to vary materially include, but are not limited to, changes in commodity and power prices; changes in market demand for our products; changes in interest and currency exchange rates; acts of governments, including the imposition of tariffs or other trade restrictions, and the outcome of legal proceedings and permitting processes; inaccurate geological and metallurgical assumptions (including with respect to the size, grade and recoverability of mineral reserves and resources); unanticipated operational difficulties (including failure of plant, equipment or processes to operate in accordance with specifications or expectations, cost escalation, unavailability of materials and equipment, government action or delays in the receipt of permits, licenses and leases or other government approvals, changes in tax or royalty rates, industrial disturbances or other job action, adverse weather conditions, social unrest, or unanticipated events related to health, safety and environmental matters); union labour disputes; political risk; social unrest; failure of customers or counterparties (including logistics suppliers) to perform their contractual obligations; changes in our credit ratings; unanticipated increases in costs to advance or construct our development projects; difficulty in obtaining permits; inability to address concerns regarding permits or environmental impact assessments; any resurgence of COVID-19 and related mitigation protocols; and changes or further deterioration in general economic conditions. The amount and timing of capital expenditures is depending upon, among other matters, being able to secure permits, equipment, supplies, materials and labour on a timely basis and at expected costs. Certain operations and projects are not controlled by us; schedules and costs may be adjusted by our partners, and timing of spending and operation of the operation or project is not in our control. Certain of our other operations and projects are operated through joint arrangements where we may not have control over all decisions, which may cause outcomes to differ from current expectations. QB production and sales guidance, costs, and capital expenditures are dependent on, among other matters, our continued ability to advance progress on remaining ramp-up activities as currently anticipated. Red Dog and QB production may also be impacted by water levels at site and our ability to manage those water levels through tailing storage facilities or otherwise. Unit costs in our copper business unit are impacted by higher profitability, which can cause higher profit-based compensation and royalty expenses. Sales to China may be impacted by general and specific port restrictions, Chinese regulation and policies, and normal production and operating risks.

ago, Evercore (NYSE:EVR) investors are up 283% since then editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 2:31 PM 3 min read In this article: EVR -2.79% Evercore Inc. ( NYSE:EVR ) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 11% in the last month. But that scarcely detracts from the really solid long term returns generated by the company over five years. In fact, the share price is 241% higher today. To some, the recent pullback wouldn't be surprising after such a fast rise. Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean it's cheap now. While the stock has fallen 5.7% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals. See our latest analysis for Evercore While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Evercore's earnings per share are down 1.0% per year, despite strong share price performance over five years. So it's hard to argue that the earnings per share are the best metric to judge the company, as it may not be optimized for profits at this point. Therefore, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movements. The modest 1.2% dividend yield is unlikely to be propping up the share price. In contrast revenue growth of 4.6% per year is probably viewed as evidence that Evercore is growing, a real positive. In that case, the company may be sacrificing current earnings per share to drive growth. The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). NYSE:EVR Earnings and Revenue Growth January 13th 2025 Take a more thorough look at Evercore's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet . What About Dividends? When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return . Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Evercore the TSR over the last 5 years was 283%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments! A Different Perspective It's nice to see that Evercore shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 59% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 31% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Evercore better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 1 warning sign with Evercore , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

Evercore Inc. \u2019s EVR efforts to boost its client base in advisory solutions and diversify revenue sources are expected to support its top-line growth over the long term. Also, a rebound in mergers and acquisition (M&A) activities, and a robust pipeline are likely to drive investment banking revenues. However, escalating costs are likely to limit bottom-line growth in the long term. EVR\u2019s Tailwinds Improving M&A Trend to Support IB Revenues: Evercore generates most of its revenues from the investment banking (IB) business. The metric witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.9% from 2017-2023, with the rising trend continuing in the first nine months of 2024. With the recovery in the financing activity, capital raising and transaction activity is picking up. Global mergers and acquisitions in 2024 showed improvement after subdued 2023 and 2022, with deal value and volume maintaining decent levels. This may lead to a positive outlook for M&A activities and has likely driven the company\u2019s backlogs. With this, EVR\u2019s IB business is likely to improve in the upcoming period. Strong Balance Sheet: The company maintains a strong balance sheet. As of Sept. 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $533.1 million, and investment securities and certificates of deposit were $1.3 billion. Total notes payable was $375.9 million as of the same date. Moreover, current assets exceeded current liabilities by $1.6 billion. Superior Return on Equity (ROE): EVR\u2019s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) reflects its superiority in terms of utilizing its shareholders\u2019 funds. The company\u2019s ROE of 20.38% compares favorably with the industry\u2019s average of 11.60%. Impressive Capital Distribution: Evercore remains committed to enhancing its shareholders\u2019 value, as seen from its involvement in steady capital distribution activities. In April 2024, the company sequentially hiked its dividend 5% to 80 cents per share. In February 2022, it was authorized with a share-repurchase program worth $1.4 billion with no expiration date. As of Sept. 30, 2024, shares worth $4.4 million were available under the authorization. The company\u2019s solid balance sheet and strong liquidity position indicate that its capital distribution activities are sustainable. Headwinds for Evercore Rising Costs: Evercore\u2019s expenses have witnessed a CAGR of 3.5% over the last five years (ended 2023), with an uptrend continuing in the first nine months of 2024. Though expenses declined in 2022 and 2023 due to a fall in employee compensation and benefit expenses, the compensation ratio will likely be stable in the upcoming quarters. A steady rise in costs is expected to impede bottom-line growth. Continua a leggere Intense Competition: The financial advisory market faces intense competition and impels companies to keep pace with the changing trends. Evercore faces competition from other large and established financial institutions, with greater name recognition and the ability to offer a wider range of products, which enhance their competitive position. The latest entries into the market could create additional pricing and competitive pressures, which might affect its results.
