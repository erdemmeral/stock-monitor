GlobalData Tue, Jan 28, 2025, 1:15 PM 2 min read In This Article: H -0.86% Hyatt Hotels has revealed a significant milestone, reporting a pipeline of nearly 138,000 rooms by the end of 2024. In conjunction with this growth, the company has undertaken a reorganisation of its brand categories. This realignment segments Hyatt's offerings into five specific collections: Luxury, Lifestyle, Inclusive, Classics, and Essentials. This strategic move aims to cater more effectively to the diverse preferences of guests and clients while optimising returns for property owners. Additionally, it streamlines Hyatt's focus and resource allocation to ensure top-tier service delivery across its portfolio. Hyatt president and CEO Mark Hoplamazian said: \"Hyatt\u2019s growth and strategic brand evolution reflect our commitment to creating long-term value for owners and driving the performance of our hotels by delivering distinctive experiences for travellers.\u201d \"By focusing on this evolution, we are not only enhancing guest satisfaction but also strengthening our hotels' success and competitive advantage, driving preference among owners, guests, customers and World of Hyatt members.\" The recent Standard International's The Standard and Bunkhouse Hotels brands acquisition, including the newly launched The StandardX brand, has added 22 open hotels and more than 30 future projects with signed agreements or letters of intent for the Lifestyle portfolio. This expansion has increased the portfolio's total pipeline properties by nearly 50% year-over-year and the number of open hotels by over 20%. Recent Lifestyle hotel openings in major markets feature Hotel Saint Augustine in Houston (under the Bunkhouse Hotels brand), The StandardX in Bangkok Phra Arthit, and Thompson Palm Springs. Upcoming openings in the Lifestyle portfolio include the TOOR Hotel in Toronto, the 28-story Standard in Brussels, the 252-key Wildbirch Hotel in Anchorage, Dream Valle de Guadalupe in Latin America, and Andaz Hong Kong Central. The new upper-midscale extended stay brand Hyatt Studios has also witnessed growth with more than 50 executed deals entering 22 new markets and attracting 27 new owners for Hyatt. The first Hyatt Studios location in Mobile/Tillman's Corner is expected to open in the first quarter of 2025, with additional deals in Fayetteville, Riverside, Pensacola, and more. Moreover, Hyatt's expanded pipeline is driving growth across all portfolios, including Luxury, with new deals and openings such as the Alila Dong'ao Island Zhuhai, Park Hyatt Johannesburg, Park Hyatt Los Cabos at Cabo del Sol, and The Seville Nomad.

The launch will follow the rebranding of Andaz Mayakoba Resort Riviera Maya to Alila Mayakoba. The resort is set to cease operations, effective 2 March 2025 and will reopen as Alila Mayakoba in the same year. Hyatt Americas group president Pete Sears said: \u201cThe planned transformation of this beloved resort into a magnificent Alila Mayakoba will inspire guests and ignite curiosity, incorporating local traditions into the guest experience with thoughtful conservation practices that make a positive impact, allowing guests the ability to be involved in the preservation of Mayakoba. \u201cAs the first Alila branded hotel in Latin America and the Caribbean, we are proud to soon introduce a new level of luxury, sustainability and impactful wellbeing that inspires guests to interact with the local community and truly immerse themselves in an authentic experience.\u201d The transformation of Andaz Mayakoba Resort will be undertaken with a focus on minimising environmental impact. The redesign will utilise locally sourced and reclaimed materials, aiming to preserve the natural beauty of Mayakoba's tropical jungles. The resort, spread across 148 acres of mangrove forests, is committed to rigorous sustainable practices upon reopening. Alila Mayakoba is envisioned as a sanctuary that integrates the unique features of Mayakoba, including its water canals and the Mayan respect for nature. RLH Properties CEO Luis Duran said: \u201cWith expertise in luxury and ultra-luxury hotels and residences in Mexico and the Caribbean, we are thrilled to pursue our next chapter with Hyatt with plans to introduce the Alila brand to the world-renowned destination of Mayakoba.\u201d In preparation for the rebranding, the resort will undergo significant changes, including a reduction in the number of guestrooms and an increase in suites, which will account for 40% of the total inventory. These wellness-focused accommodations will feature advanced design and technology. The resort will also boast extensive indoor and outdoor wellness facilities, programming from wellness experts and local healers, a renovated spa with hydrotherapy, gardens for guest activities, and a new Temazcal steam bath. The culinary experience at Alila Mayakoba will be deeply rooted in local culture, offering a variety of dining options, such as a coffee shop, a three-meal restaurant with its own organic garden, two signature restaurants, a new lobby lounge with artisanal cocktails, a beach-front restaurant, and a new beach club.

GlobalData Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 1:10 PM 3 min read In This Article: H -0.86% Hyatt Hotels has revealed a growth strategy aimed at entering 13 new markets across the Europe, Africa, and Middle East (EAME) region, where the brand is not yet present. This expansion is set to take place between 2025 and 2028, with a pipeline that includes debuts in Estonia, Iceland, Romania, Cape Verde, and Mauritius. It follows a strong performance in the EAME region. As per Hyatt\u2019s third quarter (Q3) 2024 earnings, hotels in Europe saw growth in key areas: RevPAR increased by 12.1%, ADR rose by 5.8%, and occupancy went up by 3.8%. In the resort sector, net package RevPAR grew by more than 14%, driven by the performance of Hyatt\u2019s Inclusive Collection properties in Spain, Greece, Portugal, and Bulgaria, highlighting the company\u2019s success in this segment. The expansion is also part of Hyatt's strategy to add 50 new hotels globally by next year, focusing on luxury and lifestyle segments. Hyatt president and CEO Mark Hoplamazian said: \u201cSince 2017, we have strategically expanded our global portfolio by nearly 90% to over 1,350 properties. It is inspiring to see the EAME region continue to thoughtfully add hotels in markets that matter most to our guests, World of Hyatt members, customers, owners, and investors. \u201cOur accelerated expansion is a testament to Hyatt\u2019s strength in luxury, lifestyle, and all-inclusive hospitality. As we continue to deliver on our promise of intentional growth, we are confident in the continued bright future ahead across the EAME region.\u201d In Spain, Hyatt's portfolio has seen growth, expanding from four hotels to 55, with more than 14,500 rooms as of 31 December 2024. This growth is attributed to strategic acquisitions, encompassing the all-inclusive pioneer Apple Leisure Group in 2021, lifestyle hospitality company Standard International in 2024, and a joint venture with Spanish Grupo Pi\u00f1ero. These moves have introduced properties such as The Standard, Ibiza and five Bahia Principe branded hotels to Hyatt's Inclusive Collection in Europe. Hyatt EAME group president Javier \u00c1guila said: \u201cSpain represents our largest market in EAME, and Hyatt is committed to expanding its portfolio in leisure, luxury, and lifestyle segments, across coastal destinations, islands and major and secondary cities.\u201d Set to open by next year, the Thompson Sevilla is among the highly anticipated additions to Hyatt's Spanish portfolio, introducing one of Hyatt's lifestyle brands to Spain's fourth-largest city. Beyond EAME, Latin America and the Caribbean are also focal points for Hyatt, with leisure travel driving growth. Story Continues A strategic joint venture with Grupo Pi\u00f1ero has added 21 Bahia Principe branded resorts to Hyatt's Inclusive Collection, expanding the all-inclusive room portfolio by 30%. Last year, Hyatt introduced several resorts in Latin America, including Secrets Playa Mujeres Costa Mujeres, Dreams Estrella del Mar Mazatl\u00e1n Golf & Spa Resort, and The Legend Paracas Resort. Non-resort properties such as Hyatt Centric Santo Domingo and Hyatt Centric Playa del Carmen have also been added to the portfolio. The Caribbean pipeline includes notable openings for the first half of 2025. These include Hyatt Regency Panama City, Hotel La Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Valle, Park Hyatt Los Cabos at Cabo del Sol, and Secrets Baby Beach Aruba. \"Hyatt to debut in 13 new markets across EAME region by 2028\" was originally created and published by Hotel Management Network , a GlobalData owned brand.

Inclusive Collection \u00c1guila will oversee Hyatt's global all-inclusive portfolio \u00b7 Hotel Management Network GlobalData Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 12:50 PM 2 min read In This Article: H -0.86% Hyatt Hotels has appointed Javier \u00c1guila as president of its Inclusive Collection, effective from 1 March 2025, to strengthen the focus on its global all-inclusive portfolio. \u00c1guila will undertake this role in conjunction with his existing responsibilities as group president for the Europe, Africa and Middle East (EAME) region. This strategic move aims to enhance the management of Hyatt's global all-inclusive brand portfolio, which encompasses around 55,000 rooms across 11 brands. The recent addition of the Bahia Principe Hotels & Resorts brand to Hyatt's offerings through a joint venture with Grupo Pi\u00f1ero, where \u00c1guila holds a board position, underscores this initiative. In his expanded role, \u00c1guila will be responsible for all aspects of Hyatt's global all-inclusive business. This encompasses development, operations, branding, and commercial performance. He will collaborate closely with functional teams worldwide to drive the success of the Inclusive Collection. Hyatt president and CEO Mark Hoplamazian said: \u201cWith our distinct brand portfolios and dedicated leadership, we are strengthening our commitment to delivering experiences that meet the needs of our very different guest and customer bases. \u201cJavier came to Hyatt through the acquisition of Apple Leisure Group in 2021, and between his vast all-inclusive expertise and the growth momentum the EAME region has seen under his leadership since 2022, I am confident he will bring the full potential of our growing Inclusive Collection to bear and further advance Hyatt\u2019s position as a leader in all-inclusive, caring even more deeply for guests, customers and owners in this exciting segment. Javier possesses a growth mindset and is filled with ideas for innovation and continuous improvement in performance for all our Inclusive Collection brands.\u201d \u00c1guila's new role aligns with Hyatt's organizational shift towards a more brand-centric approach, following the creation of five distinct brand categories, namely Lifestyle, Luxury, Inclusive, Classics and Essentials. This restructuring includes the establishment of a specialised Lifestyle division under the leadership of Amar Lalvani. Further developments regarding the formation of a new Luxury division are expected to be disclosed later in the year. \"Hyatt Hotels appoints Javier \u00c1guila to drive growth of Inclusive Collection\" was originally created and published by Hotel Management Network , a GlobalData owned brand.

newly rebranded Hotel Savoy Kansas City, a part of Hilton's Tapestry Collection, in Missouri, US. Formerly known as 21c Kansas City, the hotel was transformed to join the Hilton Tapestry Collection brand, which is popular for its charm, individuality and boutique experiences. The transformation blends the building\u2019s historic legacy with modern offerings and aims to elevate the experience that merges Kansas City\u2019s vibrant culture with world-class hospitality. Situated in downtown Kansas City, Hotel Savoy caters to both leisure and business travellers while the Savoy Grill is to remain a part of the newly rebranded hotel. Known for its classic American cuisine, the Savoy Grill retains its historical significance, including the booth once frequented by President Harry Truman, and it also offers a dining experience that reflects the city's rich culture. Avion Hospitality CEO and president Robert Burg said: \u201cThe Hotel Savoy, A Tapestry Collection Hotel, has undergone a complete transformation to update its design and amenities to provide our guests with what they desire to have a true Kansas City experience. \u201cWe are honoured to be a part of the Kansas City hospitality scene, marking the opening of Avion\u2019s second hotel in this vibrant market.\u201d As of November 2024, Avion Hospitality assumed management of two Hyatt Hotels in Charleston, South Carolina, following their acquisition by Highline Hospitality Partners. The Hyatt House Charleston Historic District with 113 rooms and the Hyatt Place Charleston Historic District with 191 rooms are now part of Avion's portfolio. \"Avion Hospitality takes over management of Hotel Savoy Kansas City in US\" was originally created and published by Hotel Management Network , a GlobalData owned brand.

"Will Hyatt Hotels (H) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report? Zacks Equity Research Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 8:10 PM 3 min read In This Article: H -0.86% Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Hyatt Hotels (H), which belongs to the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry, could be a great candidate to consider. When looking at the last two reports, this hotel operator has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 32.75%, on average, in the last two quarters. For the most recent quarter, Hyatt Hotels was expected to post earnings of $0.90 per share, but it reported $0.94 per share instead, representing a surprise of 4.44%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.95 per share, while it actually produced $1.53 per share, a surprise of 61.05%. Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Hyatt Hotels lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank. Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Hyatt Hotels has an Earnings ESP of +7.36% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on February 13, 2025. With the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss. Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate. Story Continues Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
