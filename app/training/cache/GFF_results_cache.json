(NYSE:GFF) and were rewarded last week after stock increased 8.3% editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sun, Jan 19, 2025, 4:45 PM 4 min read In This Article: GFF -2.40% Key Insights Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Griffon's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions A total of 11 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Recent sales by insiders Every investor in Griffon Corporation ( NYSE:GFF ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 76% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). And as as result, institutional investors reaped the most rewards after the company's stock price gained 8.3% last week. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 32%. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Griffon, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Griffon NYSE:GFF Ownership Breakdown January 19th 2025 What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Griffon? Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Griffon. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Griffon's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. NYSE:GFF Earnings and Revenue Growth January 19th 2025 Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Griffon. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 13% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 13% of common stock, and Ronald Kramer holds about 6.0% of the company stock. Ronald Kramer, who is the third-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Chairman of the Board. A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 11 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily. Story Continues Insider Ownership Of Griffon While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. It seems insiders own a significant proportion of Griffon Corporation. It has a market capitalization of just US$3.7b, and insiders have US$378m worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public Ownership With a 13% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Griffon. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. Next Steps: I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

or Hold the Stock? Avisekh  Bhattacharjee Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 6:03 PM 5 min read In This Article: MMM -1.42% 3M Company MMM is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2024 results on Jan. 21, before market open. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently pegged at $1.66 per share on revenues of $5.79 billion. Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar . Fourth-quarter earnings estimates have been revised upward by a penny over the past seven days. However, the bottom-line projection indicates a decrease of 31.4% from the year-ago number. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues indicates a year-over-year decline of 27.7%. For the current year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 3M\u2019s revenues is pegged at $23.6 billion, implying a decline of 27.8% year over year. Also, the consensus mark for current-year earnings per share is pegged at $7.28, implying a decrease of 21.2% on a year-over-year basis. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research It is worth noting that in April 2024, 3M completed the spin-off of its Health Care business into a separate public company. Notably, the spin-off is likely to have weighed on MMM\u2019s year-over-year top-line comparison in the quarter. Earnings Surprise History 3M has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company\u2019s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 9.6%. In the last reported quarter, it delivered an earnings surprise of 2.6%. 3M Company Price and EPS Surprise 3M Company Price and EPS Surprise 3M Company price-eps-surprise | 3M Company Quote Earnings Whispers for MMM Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for the company this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, but that\u2019s not the case here. MMM has an Earnings ESP of +0.72% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can uncover the best stocks before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

Weakness in the consumer retail end markets, owing to lower consumer retail discretionary spending on hardline goods, is expected to have hurt the Consumer segment\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter. There has been particular weakness in the packaging & expression, home & auto care and consumer safety and well-being businesses. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter revenues from the Consumer segment is pegged at $1.2 billion, indicating a decline of 4.8% sequentially. The Safety and Industrial segment is expected to have put up a weak show in the upcoming earnings due to softness across the industrial specialties, abrasives and automotive aftermarket businesses. However, strength in roofing granules and electrical markets is likely to have augmented its sales. The consensus estimate for the segment\u2019s revenues is pegged at $2.7 billion, indicating a 3.4% decrease from the previous quarter\u2019s number. High debt level and interest expenses remain another concern for the company. Exiting the third quarter of 2024, 3M\u2019s long-term debt was high at $11.3 billion. Also, interest expenses in the first nine months of 2024 increased 64.5% year over year to $939 million. Exiting the third quarter, its short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt totaled $1.9 billion. Higher interest expenses are likely to have proven detrimental to its profitability in the to-be-reported quarter. 3M\u2019s international presence keeps it exposed to the risk of adverse currency fluctuations. This is because a strengthening U.S. dollar requires the company to either raise prices or contract profit margins in locations outside the United States. For instance, adverse foreign currency translation lowered the company\u2019s sales by 0.3% year over year in the third quarter of 2024. Nevertheless, strength in the commercial branding and transportation end markets is expected to have driven the Transportation and Electronics segment\u2019s performance. Solid electronics demand, backed by an increase in production volume, by electronics original equipment manufacturer customers bodes well. The consensus estimate for the Transportation and Electronics segment\u2019s revenues is pegged at $1.8 billion. Story Continues Price Performance & Valuation MMM shares have gained 3% in the past three months against the Zacks Diversified Operations industry\u2019s 11% decline. The conglomerate giant\u2019s shares have also outperformed the S&P 500\u2019s growth of 2.5%. The company\u2019s peers Honeywell International Inc. HON, Federal Signal Corporation FSS and Griffon Corporation GFF have gained 0.3%, 10.3% and 12%, respectively, in the same period. MMM\u2019s Three-Month Price Performance Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research In terms of valuation, MMM\u2019s forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) is 17.70X, a premium to its five-year median of 15.05X and industry average of 15.16X. This indicates that investors will be paying a higher price than the company's expected earnings growth compared with its peers. Price-to-Earnings (Forward 12 Months) Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research How Should You Play 3M Pre-Q4 Earnings? 3M's robust and diversified portfolio, encompassing industrial abrasives, automotive components, electrical products and packaging materials, along with strength in the Transportation and Electronics segment, seems promising for its long-term growth. However, weakness in the Safety and Industrial segment, along with tepid demand in the consumer retail end markets, has been concerning for its near-term performance. Also, a high debt level and expensive valuation warrant a cautious approach for existing investors. Potential investors should consider waiting for MMM\u2019s earnings report and clearer signs of recovery before investing in the stock. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

"New Book THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MEN Rewrites the Hegemonic Norms of Western Masculinity Palmetto Publishing Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 7:00 PM 2 min read Therapist and Social Worker explores what it could look like for men to enter the inner world and soul work for healing instead of hiding from emotion in new book from Palmetto Publishing. The Incredible Shrinking Men cover Charleston, SC, Jan. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As a career therapist and social worker, Dr. Ryan J. Seidlitz has seen firsthand the damaging effects of a rigid, narrow and unimaginative masculinity on men and a society as a whole. After spending the past decade working with the incarcerated population, Dr. Seidlitz felt compelled to address the importance of men working from a different entering point in connecting with the gift of feeling and reconstruct a healthier definition of manhood in new book. In \u201cThe Incredible Shrinking Men,\u201d men are taught how to return to their humanity through healing approaches focused on connecting with and embracing emotion they have long been taught to suppress. Calling for a more compassionate form of masculinity, where men view emotions and vulnerability not as weaknesses but as teachers to guide them toward a new form of identity, Dr. Seidlitz encourages readers to listen and learn what it really means to be a man. \u201cI want men to realize that embracing their emotion and vulnerability is actually a life source,\u201d Dr. Seidlitz says. \u201cOur pain, anger, and loss provide excellent curriculum, and if we allow ourselves to connect with our emotions, we will find purpose and begin to heal.\u201d \u201cThe Incredible Shrinking Men\u201d is available for purchase on Amazon.com and BarnesandNoble.com .

1:42 PM 4 min read In This Article: GFF -2.40% GHM -0.84% FSS -1.51% GTES -2.13% Griffon Corporation GFF is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of strength across the Home and Building Products (HBP) segment. The company's efforts to reward its shareholders handsomely add to its appeal. Based in New York, Griffon Corporation is a diversified holding company with exposure in several industries. The company engages in the manufacture and sale of a wide range of consumer and professional, and home and building products, including garage doors, shutters, materials for disposable diapers and disposable health care products. GFF currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). In the past year, the stock has gained 22.7% against the industry\u2019s 9.2% decline. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Let\u2019s discuss the factors that should influence investors to retain this company for the time being. Business Strength: Griffon is witnessing strong momentum in the HBP segment. Increased demand for residential products, supported by the resiliency of repair and remodeling activity in the residential construction market, is driving the segment\u2019s results. The U.S. residential construction market is recovering in single-family housing, supported by lower interest rates and builder incentives, which is likely to be beneficial for the segment in the quarters ahead. The recovery in the commercial construction market, driven by several projects undertaken by customers, is expected to benefit the segment. Expansion Initiatives: GFF solidifies its product portfolio and leverages business opportunities through asset additions. In July 2024, it acquired an Australia-based company, Pope (a provider of residential watering products), through its subsidiary, The AMES Companies, Inc. (AMES). Pope, which has been added to Griffon\u2019s CPP segment, has expanded its product portfolio in the Australian market. The acquisition of Pope is anticipated to generate annual revenues of around $25 million and positively impact the company's earnings in the first full year of ownership. Investment in Innovation and Capacity Expansion: Griffon continues to invest in productivity, innovation and capacity expansion to further drive growth. For instance, in 2023, the company expanded Clopay's Troy manufacturing facility, which will improve Griffon\u2019s manufacturing efficiencies and introduce new product lines. This apart, the company also expanded the sectional door manufacturing capacity in Ohio to cater to increasing demand for its premium products. These projects signify a significant investment in the expansion and modernization of the company\u2019s key manufacturing and distribution facilities. Griffon plans to make additional investments in capacity expansion and technology in 2025. Rewards to Shareholders: GFF has a strong balance sheet that has enabled it to reward its shareholders handsomely through dividend payments and share buybacks. In fiscal 2024 (ended September 2024), it paid dividends worth $35.8 million and repurchased shares for $309.9 million. In November 2024, Griffon announced that the board of directors approved a new $400,000 share repurchase authorization. Also, in November 2024, the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 20%. Story Continues Downsides of GFF Stock Segmental Weakness: Weakness in the CPP segment raises concerns for Griffon. Reduced consumer demand in North America has been weighing on the segment's performance. Demand for products like outdoor tools, project tools and outdoor decor and watering products has been particularly weak. Forex Woes: GFF's international presence keeps it exposed to the risk of adverse currency fluctuations. This is because a strengthening U.S. dollar is likely to require the company to either raise prices or contract profit margins in locations outside the United States. Thus, adverse currency movements are a worry. Stocks to Consider Better-ranked companies are discussed below. Graham Corporation GHM currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Premium Value: Should You Buy, Sell or Hold? Avisekh  Bhattacharjee Fri, Jan 10, 2025, 6:42 PM 4 min read In This Article: MMM -1.42% 3M Company MMM is currently trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 17.13X compared with the Zacks Diversified Operations industry\u2019s 15.11X. With a Value Score of F, MMM stock may not present a compelling value proposition at these levels. The current valuation is above its five-year median of 15.05X. Also, the stock is overvalued compared with its peer, Carlisle Companies Incorporated CSL, which is trading at 16.46X. The company\u2019s premium valuation compared to the broader industry and peers raises concerns, considering its revenue declines over the past nine months. Valuation Remains an Overhang for 3M Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research MMM Stock\u2019s 3-Month Price Performance In the past three months, 3M stock has lost 0.2% compared with the industry\u2019s 14.2% decline. In comparison, the S&P 500 has risen 2.7% in the same period. The company has also underperformed other industry players like Honeywell International Inc. HON and Griffon Corporation GFF, which have returned 1.9% and 6%, respectively, over the said time frame. Price Performance Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Ongoing Challenges Faced by 3M Weakness in the consumer retail end markets, owing to a decrease in consumer discretionary spending, remains a concern. This is reflected in the Consumer segment\u2019s results, which declined 1.2% in the third quarter, following a 2.4% decrease in the previous quarter. There was particular weakness in packaging & expression, home & auto care and consumer safety and well-being businesses. This has impacted its overall top-line performance in the first nine months of 2024, which inched down 0.2% year over year. The company expects consumer retail discretionary spending on hardline goods to remain muted in the near term, which is likely to hurt its overall performance. High debt level remains a major concern for 3M. Exiting the third quarter of 2024, the company\u2019s long-term debt was high at $11.3 billion. Also, interest expenses in the first nine months of 2024 remained high at $939 million, increasing 64.5% on a year-over-year basis. Exiting the third quarter, its short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt totaled $1.9 billion. Considering the company's overall high debt level, its cash and cash equivalents of $6.1 billion do not look to be impressive. Exiting the third quarter of 2024, 3M\u2019s long-term debt-to-capital ratio was pinned at 70.69%, much higher than the industry\u2019s 25.83%. High debt levels, if not controlled, can increase its financial obligations and prove detrimental to profitability in the quarters ahead. Story Continues 3M LT Debt-to-Capital Ratio Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The company has also been subject to several litigations, including earplug lawsuits. It has committed substantial funds to resolve these disputes as ongoing litigation might lead to additional expenses. Per the terms of the Combat Arms Earplug settlement announced in August 2023, 3M agreed to pay a sum of $6 billion to resolve the litigation case over the period of 2023 to 2029. 3M\u2019s international presence keeps it exposed to the risk of adverse currency fluctuations. This is because a strengthening U.S. dollar may require the company to either raise prices or contract profit margins in locations outside the United States. For instance, adverse foreign currency translation lowered the company\u2019s sales by 0.3% year over year in the third quarter of 2024. MMM\u2019s Downward Earnings Estimate Revisions Reflecting the abovementioned headwinds, earnings estimates for 3M have moved down over the past 30 days. Earnings estimates for fourth-quarter 2024 and 2025 have inched down 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively. Find the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar . Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Factors Aiding the Company 3M is poised to benefit from strength in the Safety and Industrial segment. Solid momentum in the industrial adhesives and tape end markets, driven by an increase in the sales of bonding solutions for electronic devices is likely to drive the segment\u2019s performance. Strength in the commercial branding and transportation end markets has also been driving the company\u2019s Transportation and Electronics segment. Solid electronics demand, backed by an increase in production volume, by electronics original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers bodes well. However, weakness in the automotive electrification market due to a decline in automotive OEM build rates remains a concern for the segment. Conclusion 3M\u2019s market leadership position, diversified product portfolio and strong dealer network provide it with a competitive advantage to leverage the long-term demand prospects in industrial and transportation markets. However, MMM has been facing several challenges, including weakness in the retail market, high debt level and litigation cases. The downward estimate revision activity in earnings and expensive valuation warrant a cautious approach for existing investors. Potential investors should consider waiting for clearer signs of recovery before investing in this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 5 Quality Compounder Stocks and add them to your watchlist.
