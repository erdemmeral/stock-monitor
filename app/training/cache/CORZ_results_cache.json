In the current year,\u00a0AI-powered Agents\u00a0might transform industries, sectors, and everyday tasks. The agents are expected to execute tasks autonomously, refine the workflows, and enable individuals to remain focused on higher-value activities. AI and its Impact on Interest Rates Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard economist, explained the significant impact of AI on the global economy, primarily related to interest rates. He spoke to CNBC-TV18 at WEF in Davos and highlighted how artificial intelligence has been fueling shifts in productivity, labor markets, and inflation, which influence the decisions of central banks. As per the economist, AI continues to act as one of the factors responsible for higher interest rates, reiterating its increasing impact on financial markets and economic policy. With the advancement of AI technologies, apart from reshaping productivity, they also alter the dynamics of economic growth. The integration of AI across sectors is expected to result in significant shifts in labor markets and broader investment strategies, which contribute to inflationary pressures.
