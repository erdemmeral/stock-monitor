[{"text": "CMCT Announces Reverse Stock Split Business Wire Thu, Jan 2, 2025, 2:45 PM 5 min read In This Article: CMCT +1.63% DALLAS, January 02, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Creative Media & Community Trust Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCT and TASE: CMCT) (\"we,\" \"our,\" \"CMCT\" or the \"Company\") announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a reverse stock split of CMCT common stock at a ratio of one-for-ten (the \"Reverse Stock Split\"). The Reverse Stock Split will become effective at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on January 6, 2025 (the \"Effective Time\"), and CMCT common stock will begin trading on the Nasdaq Global Market on a split-adjusted basis at market open that same day. At the Effective Time, every ten shares of CMCT common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be combined into one issued and outstanding share of CMCT common stock. No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who would otherwise hold a fractional share of CMCT common stock following the Reverse Stock Split will receive a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares based on the closing price of CMCT common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market on January 6, 2025. Stockholders who hold shares of CMCT common stock in book-entry form or through a bank, broker or other nominee do not need to take any action in connection with the Reverse Stock Split, and will see the impact of the Reverse Stock Split automatically reflected in their accounts. The trading symbol of CMCT common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market will remain \"CMCT.\" CMCT common stock has been assigned a new CUSIP number of 125525527 that will be effective upon completion of the Reverse Stock Split at the Effective Time. Pursuant to the rules of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (\"TASE\"), and in order for TASE to make the appropriate adjustments to reflect the Reverse Stock Split, CMCT common stock will not trade on TASE on January 6, 2025 and will resume trading once such adjustments are made.

Story Continues Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. These statements include the plans and objectives of management for future operations, including plans and objectives relating to the Reverse Stock Split. Such forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"project,\" \"target,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"might,\" \"believe,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"continue,\" \"pursue,\" \"potential,\" \"forecast,\" \"seek,\" \"plan,\" \"should\" or \"goal\" or the negative thereof or other variations or similar words or phrases. Such forward-looking statements also include, among others, statements about CMCT\u2019s plans and objectives relating to the Reverse Stock Split. Such forward-looking statements are based on particular assumptions that management of CMCT has made in light of its experience, as well as its perception of expected future developments and other factors that it believes are appropriate under the circumstances. Forward-looking statements are necessarily estimates reflecting the judgment of CMCT\u2019s management and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include those associated with (i) the effects of the Reverse Stock Split, (ii) the timing, form, and operational effects of CMCT\u2019s development activities, (iii) the ability of CMCT to raise in place rents to existing market rents and to maintain or increase occupancy levels, (iv) fluctuations in market rents, (v) the effects of inflation and continuing higher interest rates on the operations and profitability of CMCT and (vi) general economic, market and other conditions. Additional important factors that could cause CMCT\u2019s actual results to differ materially from CMCT\u2019s expectations are discussed in \"Item 1A\u2014Risk Factors\" in CMCT\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in Part II, Item 1A of CMCT\u2019s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations and there can be no assurance that these expectations will be attained. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond CMCT\u2019s control. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements expressed or implied will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements expressed or implied herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by CMCT or any other person that CMCT\u2019s objectives and plans will be achieved. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. CMCT does not undertake to update them to reflect changes that occur after the date they are made, except as may be required by applicable laws.

Story Continues Forward Looking Statements This press release contains certain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. These statements include the plans and objectives of management for future operations, including plans and objectives relating to future growth of CMCT\u2019s business and availability of funds. Such forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"project,\" \"target,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"might,\" \"believe,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"continue,\" \"pursue,\" \"potential,\" \"forecast,\" \"seek,\" \"plan,\" or \"should,\" or \"goal\" or the negative thereof or other variations or similar words or phrases. Such forward-looking statements also include, among others, statements about CMCT\u2019s plans and objectives relating to future growth and outlook. Such forward-looking statements are based on particular assumptions that management of CMCT has made in light of its experience, as well as its perception of expected future developments and other factors that it believes are appropriate under the circumstances. Forward-looking statements are necessarily estimates reflecting the judgment of CMCT\u2019s management and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include those associated with (i) whether CMCT can complete the refinancing of additional assets and repayment of its recourse corporate-level credit facility on terms favorable to CMCT, or at all, (ii) the timing, form, and operational effects of CMCT\u2019s development activities, (iii) the ability of CMCT to raise in place rents to existing market rents and to maintain or increase occupancy levels, (iv) fluctuations in market rents, (v) the effects of inflation and continuing higher interest rates on the operations and profitability of CMCT and (vi) general economic, market and other conditions. Additional important factors that could cause CMCT\u2019s actual results to differ materially from CMCT\u2019s expectations are discussed in \"Item 1A\u2014Risk Factors\" in CMCT\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in Part II, Item 1A of CMCT\u2019s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations and there can be no assurance that these expectations will be attained. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond CMCT\u2019s control. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements expressed or implied will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements expressed or implied herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by CMCT or any other person that CMCT\u2019s objectives and plans will be achieved. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. CMCT does not undertake to update them to reflect changes that occur after the date they are made, except as may be required by applicable laws.

Previously Announced Program to Strengthen Balance Sheet and Liquidity DALLAS, December 09, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Creative Media & Community Trust Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCT and TASE: CMCT) (the \"Company\") announced today it has closed a secured, non-recourse loan of up to $92.2 million (the \"Sheraton Mortgage Loan\") on its Sheraton Grand Sacramento Hotel and parking garage located at 1230 J Street in downtown Sacramento, California. The Sheraton Mortgage Loan is a floating rate, interest-only loan which matures in December 2026, with three one-year extension options that are subject to customary extension conditions. The Sheraton Mortgage Loan consists of (a) an $84.3 million closing day advance that was used by the Company to paydown existing debt on its corporate-level credit facility (the balance outstanding on the corporate facility was reduced to approximately $97.3 million from $169.3 million), pay certain of the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the closing of the Sheraton Mortgage Loan, and to fund amounts related to a comprehensive renovation of the Sheraton Grand Sacramento Hotel\u2019s 505 guest rooms and suites (the \"Room Renovations\") and (b) a future advance component of up to $7.9 million to fund additional amounts related to the Room Renovations. The Room Renovations were initiated earlier this year and the Company anticipates they will be completed by 2024 year-end. In 2025, the Company plans to improve and modernize the hotel\u2019s ballroom and meeting space, food and beverage outlets and common areas. These upgrades will primarily be funded from proceeds to be received as part of a recently executed, long-term extension of the Sheraton Grand\u2019s management agreement with Marriott International. The Company is in the advanced stages of refinancing several additional assets and intends to use part of the proceeds from these property-level refinancings to fully repay and retire its recourse corporate-level credit facility. The Company intends to invest remaining proceeds, along with proceeds from any future potential asset sales, principally in premier multifamily properties as part of its ongoing shift away from traditional office.

Story Continues Forward Looking Statements This press release contains certain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. These statements include the plans and objectives of management for future operations, including plans relating to the refinancing of additional assets and the intention to repay and retire CMCT\u2019s recourse corporate-level credit facility. Such forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"project,\" \"target,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"might,\" \"believe,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"continue,\" \"pursue,\" \"potential,\" \"forecast,\" \"seek,\" \"plan,\" or \"should,\" or \"goal\" or the negative thereof or other variations or similar words or phrases. Such forward-looking statements also include, among others, statements about CMCT\u2019s plans and objectives relating to the refinancing of additional assets and the intention to repay and retire CMCT\u2019s recourse corporate-level credit facility. Such forward-looking statements are based on particular assumptions that management of CMCT has made in light of its experience, as well as its perception of expected future developments and other factors that it believes are appropriate under the circumstances. Forward-looking statements are necessarily estimates reflecting the judgment of CMCT\u2019s management and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include those associated with (i) whether CMCT can complete the refinancing of additional assets and repayment of its recourse corporate-level credit facility on terms favorable to CMCT, or at all, (ii) the timing, form, and operational effects of CMCT\u2019s development activities, (iii) the ability of CMCT to raise in place rents to existing market rents and to maintain or increase occupancy levels, (iv) fluctuations in market rents, (v) the effects of inflation and continuing higher interest rates on the operations and profitability of CMCT and (vi) general economic, market and other conditions. Additional important factors that could cause CMCT\u2019s actual results to differ materially from CMCT\u2019s expectations are discussed in \"Item 1A\u2014Risk Factors\" in CMCT\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in Part II, Item 1A of CMCT\u2019s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations and there can be no assurance that these expectations will be attained. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond CMCT\u2019s control. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements expressed or implied will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements expressed or implied herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by CMCT or any other person that CMCT\u2019s objectives and plans will be achieved. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. CMCT does not undertake to update them to reflect changes that occur after the date they are made, except as may be required by applicable laws.

Transaction provides cash distribution to CMCT as well a recurring management fee DALLAS, November 07, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--CMCT (NASDAQ: CMCT and TASE: CMCT) announced today that an international institutional investor has acquired a 49 percent interest in 1902 Park Ave., a premier, Class A apartment property located in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, a thriving walkable submarket with abundant dining and entertainment options. Proceeds from the investment were used to pay off the mortgage and fund a distribution to CMCT and another CIM-advised fund. CMCT and the CIM-advised fund each acquired a 50 percent ownership in 1902 Park Ave. in early 2023 in an off-market transaction. These two funds will earn a management fee and potentially an incentive fee based on future performance. 1902 Park Ave. is a 75-unit apartment community located adjacent to 1910 W. Sunset Blvd., an eight-story creative office property that was acquired by CMCT in February 2022. CMCT is currently developing a former surface parking lot at 1910 W. Sunset Boulevard into a 36-unit premier apartment community, which is expected to be complete in the third quarter of 2025. Both the 1910 W. Sunset Blvd. creative office building and apartment development are CMCT joint ventures with an international pension fund.

These statements include the plans and objectives of management for future operations, including plans relating to 1902 Park Avenue and 1910 W.

Such forward-looking statements also include, among others, statements about CMCT\u2019s plans and objectives relating to 1902 Park Avenue and 1910 W.

Forward-looking statements are necessarily estimates reflecting the judgment of CMCT\u2019s management and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include those associated with (i) the timing, form, and operational effects of CMCT\u2019s development activities, (ii) the ability of CMCT to raise in place rents to existing market rents and to maintain or increase occupancy levels, (iii) fluctuations in market rents, (iv) the effects of inflation and continuing higher interest rates on the operations and profitability of CMCT and (v) general economic, market and other conditions. Additional important factors that could cause CMCT\u2019s actual results to differ materially from CMCT\u2019s expectations are discussed in \"Item 1A\u2014Risk Factors\" in CMCT\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in Part II, Item 1A of CMCT\u2019s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time.

Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 2:00 PM 32 min read In This Article: CMCT +1.63% DALLAS, November 08, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Creative Media & Community Trust Corporation (NASDAQ and TASE: CMCT) (\"we\", \"our\", \"CMCT\", or the \"Company\"), today reported operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Third Quarter 2024 Highlights Real Estate Portfolio Same-store office portfolio (2) was 72.9% leased. Executed 4,850 square feet of leases with terms longer than 12 months. Financial Results Net loss attributable to common stockholders of $34.8 million, or $1.22 per diluted share. Funds from operations attributable to common stockholders (\"FFO\") (3)1 was $(28.4) million, or $(1.00) per diluted share. Core FFO attributable to common stockholders (4)1 was $(11.5) million, or $(0.40) per diluted share. In September 2024, the Company suspended its offering of Series A1 Preferred Stock and redeemed a total of 2,589,606 and 2,167,156 shares of Series A1 Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred stock, respectively, which were paid in shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock, resulting in the total issuance of 60,526,804 shares of Common Stock. Management Commentary \"We continue to make progress on our previously announced actions to accelerate our focus towards premier multifamily assets, strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity,\" said David Thompson, Chief Executive Officer of Creative Media & Community Trust Corporation. \"We are in the advanced stages of refinancing several of our assets. We intend to use part of the proceeds from these property-level refinancings to fully repay and retire our recourse corporate-level credit facility. We plan to invest any remaining proceeds, along with proceeds from any future potential asset sales, principally in premier multifamily properties.\" \"We also continued to make progress on our multifamily development pipeline and hotel renovation. We finalized our partial conversion of office to multifamily at our 4750 Wilshire / 701 S Hudson property in the quarter and commenced the lease up of the 68 luxury units. We continue to expect our 36-unit multifamily development in Echo Park Los Angeles to be completed in the third quarter of 2025. At our hotel property, we completed the renovation of nearly 300 rooms. While the construction related to the renovations impacted our third quarter results, we anticipate finalizing all 503 rooms around 2024 year-end.\" Third Quarter 2024 Results Real Estate Portfolio As of September 30, 2024, our real estate portfolio consisted of 27 assets, all of which were fee-simple properties and five of which we own through investments in unconsolidated joint ventures (the \"Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\"). The Unconsolidated Joint Ventures own two office properties (one of which has been partially converted into multifamily units), one multifamily site currently under development, one multifamily property and one commercial development site. The portfolio includes 13 office properties, totaling approximately 1.3 million rentable square feet, three multifamily properties totaling 696 units, nine development sites (three of which are being used as parking lots) and one 503-room hotel with an ancillary parking garage. Story Continues Financial Results Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $34.8 million, or $1.22 per diluted share of Common Stock, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $22.9 million, or $0.94 per diluted share of Common Stock, for the same period in 2023. The increase in net loss attributable to common stockholders was driven by a decrease in FFO 2 of $20.9 million (described below), partially offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense, adjusted for the impact of non controlling interests, of $9.1 million. FFO 2 attributable to common stockholders (3) was $(28.4) million, or $(1.00) per diluted share of Common Stock for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $(7.5) million, or $(0.31) per diluted share of Common Stock, for the same period in 2023. The decrease in FFO 2 was primarily attributable to an increase in redeemable preferred stock redemptions of $15.7 million, a decrease of $3.6 million in segment net operating income and an increase in redeemable preferred stock dividends of $1.2 million. Core FFO 2 attributable to common stockholders (4) was $(11.5) million, or $(0.40) per diluted share of Common Stock for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $(7.1) million, or $(0.29) per diluted share of Common Stock, for the same period in 2023. The decrease in Core FFO 2 is attributable to the aforementioned changes in FFO 2 , while not impacted by the increase in redeemable preferred stock redemptions or transaction-related costs, as these are excluded from our Core FFO 2 calculation. Segment Information Our reportable segments during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted of three types of commercial real estate properties, namely, office, hotel and multifamily, as well as a segment for our lending business. Total segment net operating income (\"NOI\") (5) was $7.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $11.2 million for the same period in 2023. Office Same-Store Same-store (2) office segment NOI (5) decreased to $5.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $9.4 million in the same period in 2023, while same-store (1) office Cash NOI (6)2 decreased to $6.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $9.9 million in the same period in 2023. The decreases in same-store (2) office segment NOI (5) and same-store (2) office cash NOI (6)2 were primarily attributable to our same store unconsolidated office entities, which collectively experienced a net unrealized loss on their investments in real estate, compared to net a unrealized gain recognized in the prior year-period. In addition, our consolidated same-store office properties saw an increase in operating expenses, primarily attributable to higher repairs and maintenance, utilities, and administrative expenses at an office property in Oakland, California and higher repairs and maintenance expenses and real estate tax expense at an office property in Austin, Texas. At September 30, 2024, the Company\u2019s same-store (2) office portfolio was 72.2% occupied, a decrease of 990 basis points year-over-year on a same-store (2) basis, and 72.9% leased, a decrease of 1,100 basis points year-over-year on a same-store (2) basis. The annualized rent per occupied square foot (7) on a same-store (2) basis was $60.31 at September 30, 2024, compared to $57.04 at September 30, 2023. During three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company executed 4,850 square feet of leases with terms longer than 12 months at our same-store (2) office portfolio. Total Office Segment NOI (5) decreased to $5.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $9.3 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was due to the decrease in same-store (2) office segment NOI (5) discussed above. Hotel Hotel Segment NOI (5) was $973,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease from $1.9 million for the same period in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in occupancy, which was negatively impacted by ongoing construction related to hotel renovations, beginning during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The following table sets forth the occupancy, average daily rate and revenue per available room for our hotel in Sacramento, California for the specified periods: Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Occupancy 55.5 % 68.9 % Average daily rate (a) $ 184.69 $ 175.91 Revenue per available room (b) $ 102.55 $ 121.14 ______________________ (a) Calculated as trailing 3-month room revenue divided by the number of rooms occupied. (b) Calculated as trailing 3-month room revenue divided by the number of available rooms. Multifamily Our Multifamily Segment consists of two multifamily buildings located in Oakland, California as well as an investment in a multifamily building in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, California through one of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, all of which were acquired during the first quarter of 2023. Our multifamily segment NOI (5) was $508,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $(391,000) for the same period in 2023. The increase in our multifamily segment NOI (5) was primarily due to higher occupancy and higher net monthly rent per occupied unit (9) at our multifamily properties in Oakland, California during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, our Multifamily Segment was 92.0% occupied, monthly rent per occupied unit (8) was $2,555 and net monthly rent per occupied unit (9) was $2,444, compared to 84.1%, $2,869, and $2,100, respectively, as of September 30, 2023. Lending Our lending segment primarily consists of our SBA 7(a) lending platform, which is a national lender that primarily originates loans to small businesses in the hospitality industry. Lending segment NOI (5) was $688,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $366,000 for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense resulting from the amount of principal repayments on our SBA 7(a) loan-backed notes. ______________________ 1 Non-GAAP financial measure.

Debt and Equity During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 548,876 shares of Series A1 Preferred Stock for aggregate net proceeds of $12.2 million. Net proceeds represent gross proceeds offset by costs specifically identifiable to the offering, such as commissions, dealer manager fees and other offering fees and expenses as well as allocated indirect offering costs. In September 2024, the Company suspended its offering of Series A1 Preferred Stock. In addition, in September 2024, the Company redeemed a total of 2,589,606 and 2,167,156 shares of Series A1 Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred stock, respectively, which were paid in shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock (including the payment of accrued and unpaid dividends on the redeemed shares), resulting in the total issuance of 60,526,804 shares of Common Stock. In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 we made incremental paydowns of $4.0 million on our revolving credit facility. Dividends On September 16, 2024, we declared a stock dividend of $0.04 (or 0.0202 shares of Common Stock) per share of Common Stock, payable in shares of Common Stock on October 8, 2024, using a price of $1.985 per share, resulting in the issuance of 1,684,634 shares of Common Stock. About the Data Descriptions of certain performance measures, including Segment NOI, Cash NOI, FFO attributable to common stockholders, and Core FFO attributable to common stockholders are provided below. Certain of these performance measures\u2014Cash NOI, FFO attributable to common stockholders and Core FFO attributable to common stockholders \u2014are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the subsequent tables for reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. (1) Stabilized office portfolio : represents office properties where occupancy was not impacted by a redevelopment or repositioning during the period. (2) Same-store properties : are properties that we have owned and operated in a consistent manner and reported in our consolidated results during the entire span of the periods being reported. We excluded from our same-store property set this quarter any properties (i) acquired on or after July 1, 2023; (ii) sold or otherwise removed from our consolidated financial statements on or before September 30, 2024; or (iii) that underwent a major repositioning project we believed significantly affected its results at any point during the period commencing on July 1, 2023 and ending on September 30, 2024. When determining our same-store office properties as of September 30, 2024, one office property was excluded pursuant to (i) and (iii) above and one office property as excluded pursuant to (ii) above. (3) FFO attributable to common stockholders (\"FFO\") : represents net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, computed in accordance with GAAP, which reflects the deduction of redeemable preferred stock dividends accumulated, excluding gain (or loss) from sales of real estate, impairment of real estate, and real estate depreciation and amortization. We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (the \"NAREIT\"). See \u2018Core FFO\u2019 definition below for discussion of the benefits and limitations of FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance. (4) Core FFO attributable to common stockholders (\"Core FFO\") : represents FFO attributable to common stockholders (computed as described above), excluding gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt, redeemable preferred stock deemed dividends, redeemable preferred stock redemptions, gain (loss) on termination of interest rate swaps, and transaction costs. We believe that FFO is a widely recognized and appropriate measure of the performance of a REIT and that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. In addition, we believe that Core FFO is a useful metric for securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of our Company as it excludes from FFO the effect of certain amounts that we believe are non-recurring, are non-operating in nature as they relate to the manner in which we finance our operations, or transactions outside of the ordinary course of business. Like any metric, FFO and Core FFO should not be used as the only measure of our performance because it excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our real estate properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, and Core FFO excludes amounts incurred in connection with non-recurring special projects, prepaying or defeasing our debt, repurchasing our preferred stock, and adjusting the carrying value of our preferred stock classified in temporary equity to its redemption value, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our operating results. Other REITs may not calculate FFO and Core FFO in the same manner as we do, or at all; accordingly, our FFO and Core FFO may not be comparable to the FFOs and Core FFOs of other REITs. Therefore, FFO and Core FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) as a measure of our performance and should not be used as a supplement to or substitute measure for cash flows from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP. FFO and Core FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends. FFO and Core FFO per share for the year-to-date period may differ from the sum of quarterly FFO and Core FFO per share amounts due to the required method for computing per share amounts for the respective periods. In addition, FFO and Core FFO per share is calculated independently for each component and may not be additive due to rounding. (5) Segment NOI : for our real estate segments represents rental and other property income and expense reimbursements less property related expenses and excludes non-property income and expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, corporate related general and administrative expenses, gain (loss) on sale of real estate, gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt, impairment of real estate, transaction costs, and benefit (provision) for income taxes. For our lending segment, Segment NOI represents interest income net of interest expense and general overhead expenses. See \u2018Cash NOI\u2019 definition below for discussion of the benefits and limitations of Segment NOI as a supplemental measure of operating performance. (6) Cash NOI : for our real estate segments, represents Segment NOI adjusted to exclude the effect of the straight lining of rents, acquired above/below market lease amortization and other adjustments required by generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). For our lending segment, there is no distinction between Cash NOI and Segment NOI. We also evaluate the operating performance and financial results of our operating segments using cash basis NOI excluding lease termination income, or \"Cash NOI excluding lease termination income\". Segment NOI and Cash NOI are not measures of operating results or cash flows from operating activities as measured by GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to income from continuing operations, or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity, or as an indication of our performance or of our ability to pay dividends. Companies may not calculate Segment NOI or Cash NOI in the same manner. We consider Segment NOI and Cash NOI to be useful performance measures to investors and management because, when compared across periods, they reflect the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating our properties and the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from income from continuing operations. Additionally, we believe that Cash NOI is helpful to investors because it eliminates straight line rent and other non-cash adjustments to revenue and expenses. (7) Annualized rent per occupied square foot : represents gross monthly base rent under leases commenced as of the specified periods, multiplied by twelve. This amount reflects total cash rent before abatements. Where applicable, annualized rent has been grossed up by adding annualized expense reimbursements to base rent. Annualized rent for certain office properties includes rent attributable to retail. (8) Monthly rent per occupied unit : Represents gross monthly base rent under leases commenced as of the specified period, divided by occupied units. This amount reflects total cash rent before concessions. (9) Net monthly rent per occupied unit : Represents gross monthly base rent under leases commenced as of the specified period less rent concessions granted during the specified period, divided by occupied units.

FFO represents net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), which reflects the deduction of redeemable preferred stock dividends accumulated, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, impairment of real estate, and real estate depreciation and amortization. We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (the \"NAREIT\"). Like any metric, FFO should not be used as the only measure of our performance because it excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our real estate properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our operating results. Other REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the NAREIT; accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to the FFO of other REITs. Therefore, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) as a measure of our performance and should not be used as a supplement to or substitute measure for cash flows from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders to FFO attributable to common stockholders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

CREATIVE MEDIA & COMMUNITY TRUST CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Core Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders (Unaudited and in thousands, except per share amounts) In addition to calculating FFO in accordance with the standards established by NAREIT, we also calculate a supplemental FFO metric we call Core FFO attributable to common stockholders. Core FFO attributable to common stockholders represents FFO attributable to common stockholders, computed in accordance with NAREIT's standards, excluding losses (or gains) on early extinguishment of debt, redeemable preferred stock redemptions, gains (or losses) on termination of interest rate swaps, and transaction costs. We believe that Core FFO is a useful metric for securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of our Company as it excludes from FFO the effect of certain amounts that we believe are non-recurring, are non-operating in nature as they relate to the manner in which we finance our operations, or transactions outside of the ordinary course of business. Like any metric, Core FFO should not be used as the only measure of our performance because, in addition to excluding those items prescribed by NAREIT when calculating FFO, it excludes amounts incurred in connection with non-recurring special projects, prepaying or defeasing our debt and repurchasing our preferred stock, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our operating results. Other REITs may not calculate Core FFO in the same manner as we do, or at all; accordingly, our Core FFO may not be comparable to the Core FFO of other REITs who calculate such a metric. Therefore, Core FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) as a measure of our performance and should not be used as a supplement to or substitute measure for cash flows from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP. Core FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.

CREATIVE MEDIA & COMMUNITY TRUST CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Reconciliation of Net Operating Income (Unaudited and in thousands) We internally evaluate the operating performance and financial results of our real estate segments based on segment NOI, which is defined as rental and other property income and expense reimbursements less property related expenses and excludes non-property income and expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, corporate related general and administrative expenses, gain (loss) on sale of real estate, gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt, impairment of real estate, transaction costs, and provision for income taxes. For our lending segment, we define segment NOI as interest income net of interest expense and general overhead expenses. We also evaluate the operating performance and financial results of our operating segments using cash basis NOI, or \"cash NOI\". For our real estate segments, we define cash NOI as segment NOI adjusted to exclude the effect of the straight lining of rents, acquired above/below market lease amortization and other adjustments required by GAAP. Cash NOI is not a measure of operating results or cash flows from operating activities as measured by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to income from continuing operations, or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity, or as an indication of our performance or of our ability to pay dividends. Companies may not calculate cash NOI in the same manner. We consider cash NOI to be a useful performance measure to investors and management because, when compared across periods, it reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating our properties and the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from income from continuing operations. Additionally, we believe that cash NOI is helpful to investors because it eliminates straight line rent and other non-cash adjustments to revenue and expenses. Below is a reconciliation of cash NOI to segment NOI and net income (loss) attributable to the Company for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Release Date: November 08, 2024 For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript . Positive Points Creative Media & Community Trust ( NASDAQ:CMCT ) is committed to increasing its multifamily portfolio and reducing traditional office assets, aligning with current market trends. The company is in advanced stages of refinancing several assets, including the Sheraton Grant Hotel and high-quality Los Angeles office assets, to improve liquidity and cash flow. CMCT completed an office-to-multifamily conversion at 4750 Wilshire and is on track to complete a 36-unit multifamily development in Echo Park, Los Angeles. The company successfully closed a co-investment in a premier Class A apartment property at 1902 Park Avenue, providing cash distribution and recurring management fees. Occupancy rates in CMCT's multifamily segment improved significantly, reaching about 92% at the end of the quarter, driven by better performance in Oakland properties. Negative Points CMCT continues to face challenges in the real estate market, particularly with traditional office assets and soft rental rates in the Bay Area. The company's office lease percentage declined to 72.9% from 83.5% last quarter, primarily due to lower occupancy at the One Oakland office building. Renovation disruptions at the Sacramento hotel significantly impacted results, although completion is expected by year-end. Net Operating Income (NOI) decreased by $3.6 million compared to the prior year, with notable declines in the office and hotel segments. The company's Funds from Operations (FFO) was negative, driven by preferred stock redemptions and decreased segment NOI. Q & A Highlights Q : Can you provide some color on the drivers behind the decision to convert preferred shares into common equity, and is there potential for more conversions going forward? A : David Thompson, CEO: The conversion is part of our strategy to strengthen the balance sheet, improve cash flow, and focus on liquidity. Our target capital structure includes about 40% common equity, and this conversion helps align with that target. Future conversions will depend on various factors, including trading conditions and board decisions. Story Continues Q : Is there a specific conversion price that might deter further conversions, given the current stock performance? A : David Thompson, CEO: Several factors will be considered, including trading prices and benefits to liquidity and capital structure. The board will ultimately decide on future conversions. Q : Regarding planned future refinancings, is there an expected range of interest rate savings? A : Steve Altebrando, IR Contact Officer: Interest rate savings are possible, but the primary focus is shifting to a property-level financing strategy to reduce overall enterprise risk and extend debt maturities. Q : Will refinancings create more capital, and will the focus be on fixed or floating rates? A : Steve Altebrando, IR Contact Officer: There is potential to free up capital, and the focus will primarily be on fixed rates, except for the hotel, which will have a floating rate due to its business plan. Q : Are there plans for asset dispositions or other capital-raising activities now that the preferred pipeline is suspended? A : Steve Altebrando, IR Contact Officer: We are evaluating all assets for potential sale to raise capital and position the portfolio for future growth.

Operator Hello and welcome to the Creative Media and Community Trust. Third quarter, 2024 earnings call, (Operator Instructions) I would now like to hand the call to Steve Altebrando. Please go ahead. Steve Altebrando Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us. My name is Steve Altebrando, the portfolio oversight for CMCT. Also on the call today are David Thompson, our Chief Executive Officer and Barry Berlin, our Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast and will be temporarily archived on the investor relations section of our website where you can also find our earnings release. Our earnings release includes a reconciliation of nongaap financial measures discussed during today's call. During this call. We will make forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of assumptions made by and information currently available to us. Our actual results will be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and other factors that are beyond our control or ability to predict. Although we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, they are not guarantees of future performance and some will prove to be incorrect. Therefore, our actual future results can be expected to differ from our expectations and those differences may be material for a more detailed description of potential risks. Please refer to our sec filings which can be found in the investor relations section of our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to David Thompson. David Thompson Thanks Steve and thank you everyone for joining our call. Today. We continue to work through the challenges in the real estate market, particularly the traditional office asset class, as well as the challenges in the Bay area. We remain committed to increasing our multifamily portfolio as well as reducing our traditional office assets. A strategy that we have pursued for more than two years and believe is best suited for the current market environment. In the third quarter, we announced actions to accelerate our focus towards premier multifamily assets. These steps are also aimed at strengthening our balance sheet and improving our liquidity and cash flow. We are making progress against these goals. First, we are in the advanced stages of refinancing several of our assets including our Sheraton Grant Hotel and several of our high quality Los Angeles office assets. We intend to use the proceeds from these property level refinancings to fully repay and retire our recourse corporate level credit facility. We plan to invest in your remaining proceeds along with proceeds from future potential asset sales or refinancings principally to acquire additional premier multifamily properties. Second, we continue to make progress on rebalancing our portfolio including through our multifamily development pipeline and the renovation of our hotel asset. We will continue to evaluate the disposition of assets that do not fit our strategy with respect to our multifamily pipeline. We recently completed an office to multifamily conversion at 4,750 Wilshire and are on track to complete our 36 unit multifamily development in Echo Park in Los Angeles. In the third quarter of 2025 we also just closed a coinvestment in 1,902 Park Avenue, another premier class a apartment property which is located also in Echo Park. That transaction provided a cash distribution to CMC and will contribute recurring management fees. We believe we have a growing portfolio of premier assets and these steps will better position the company to participate in the real estate recovery. Turning to our third quarter results, we continue to be impacted by elevated short term interest rates, continued soft rental rates at our Bay area multifamily assets, lower office occupancy and renovation disruption at our hotel with respect to the office we noted last quarter, our largest tenant at one Kaiser Plaza gave back approximately 130,000 square feet at the end of July with respect to our hotel. Our results were significantly impacted this quarter by a temporary disruption from the renovation of our hotel property in Sacramento. However, we anticipate finalizing the room renovation around year end which will be in time for the busier seasonal period typically in the 1st and 2nd quarters of each year. With that, I will turn it over to Steve to provide a further update on our development pipeline, the portfolio and our co investment activity. Story Continues Steve Altebrando Thanks David. Starting with the coinvestment, we just closed at 1902, Park Avenue, a 75 unit, fully leased apartment community, an international institutional investor acquired a 49% interest in this premier class a apartment property located in Echo Park, a thriving walkable submarket with abundant dining and entertainment options. Proceeds from the investment were used to pay off the mortgage and fund a distribution to C MC T and another C I IC im advised fund, the CMCT and the CIM advised fund each acquired a 50% ownership interest in 1902 Park Avenue in early 2023. In an off market transaction. After this transaction, CMc T's ownership will decline to about 25.5%. C MC T will earn a management fee and potentially an incentive fee based on future performance. This represents C Mc T's second coinvestment where C MC T earns fee income turning to our development pipeline. And as David just mentioned, we have three projects underway or just completed including two multifamily projects in L A and the hotel room renovation in Sacramento. Starting with our multifamily projects, our office to residential project at 4,750 Wiltshire was completed in the third quarter ahead of schedule with the residential component being renamed 701, South Hudson. The asset is located in Hancock Park, an affluent residential submarket of L A where housing is supply constrained. The property was previously a three story office building and the ground floor creative office is 100% leased and the top two floors were converted to 68 high end four rent residential units leasing has commenced and as of today, the residential portion is currently 10% leased. We are also evaluating additional multifamily development opportunities at this property on adjacent land that is currently used for surface parking. We are in the initial stages of seeking entitlements. Our second multifamily development is 1,915 Park in Echo Park which has an expected mid 2025 delivery upon completion, the new seven story building will feature 36 units. The building is currently being topped off with rough and work underway. Turning to our hotel. Our $21 million room renovation at the Sheridan Grand Sacramento which began in July includes a refresh of ALL503 rooms. We have completed nearly 300 rooms so far and we expect to complete the project around the end of 2024 which is also ahead of our original schedule. We believe this renovation will be especially beneficial to the asset as it is one of just two hotels located directly across the street from Sacramento's Convention Center which itself completed a major renovation and expansion in 2021 according to our operating portfolio on a consolidated basis. At quarter end, our multifamily segment was about 92% occupied excluding the recently opened seven and one South Hudson property. This compares to 79.3% at the end of 2023. This increase is largely driven by a significant improvement in occupancy at our channel house and 1,150 clay multifamily assets in Oakland. Our achieved rental rates have been below expectations as the market continues to absorb the high level of supply added across Oakland in 2018 through 2022. Given the still elevated cost to develop, we believe the local rents would need to increase dramatically before it is economical to see new multifamily construction. Therefore, we expect minimal new supply for the foreseeable future and eventually market rent growth. Turning to office overall, our office lease percentage declined to 72.9% at the end of the quarter from 83.5% last quarter. Primarily due to the lower occupancy at our One Oakland office building, a traditional office investment that does not fit our current strategy with that. I'll turn it over to Barry. Barry Berlin Thank you, Steve. Good morning. I will be going over some of our financial highlights for the third quarter starting with our segment. No, I, which was $7.6 million for the third quarter of 2024. Compared to $11.2 million in the prior year. Comparable period. A decrease of $3.6 million broken down by our four segments. We experienced decreases of $3.9 million in our office segment and $950,000 in our hotel segment, which were partially offset by increases of $900,000 and $320,000 respectively. In our multifamily and lending business segments. Our office segment decrease of $3.9 million in net O I to $5.4 million from $9.3 million was primarily driven by the pickup of earnings from our unconsolidated office entities which collectively experienced net unrealized losses on their investments in real estate during the current quarter compared to net unrealized gains in Q3 last year. Additionally, we saw an increase in operating expenses at our consolidated properties primarily at an office property in Oakland, California and an office property in Austin, Texas. Our hotel segment decrease of $950,000 in no I to $970,000 for the third quarter of 2024. From $1.9 million in the third quarter. Last year was primarily attributable to a decrease in occupancy which was negatively impacted by construction related to hotel renovations that began during the third quarter of 2024. Our multifamily segment increase of approximately $900,000 in no I to a profit of $510,000 from a loss of $390,000 for the third quarter. Last year, the improvement was primarily due to higher occupancy and higher monthly rent per occupied unit net of rent concessions at our multifamily properties in Oakland, California and our lending division increase of $325,000 in no I to approximately $690,000 from $365,000 for the third quarter. Last year was primarily due to decreased interest expense resulting from principal repayments on our SB A seven a loan back notes in our non segment expenses. We had a significant decrease in depreciation and amortization of $9.7 million which was driven by the full amortization during 2023 of the acquired in place and tangible assets for our Oakland assets while there was no amortization for acquired in place lease intangible assets during 2024. Also of importance is our election to redeem a total of approximately $2.6 million shares of series A one preferred stock and $2.2 million shares of series A preferred stock. In late September 2024 we paid for these redemptions through the issuance of shares of our common stock which in total amounted to approximately $60.5 million shares. Concurrent with such redemption, we suspended our offering of the series A one preferred stock. The redemption caused us to record approximately $16 million as a reduction of net income available to common stockholders. The preferred redemptions are part of our ongoing efforts to improve our liquidity and FFO and based on the current fed funds rate will reduce our preferred dividend by nearly $8 million per year. Our FFO was a negative $1 per diluted share compared to negative 31\u00a2 in the prior year comparable period. And our core FFO was a negative 40\u00a2 per diluted share compared to a negative 29\u00a2 in the prior year comparable period. The decrease in FFO was primarily caused by the redeemable preferred stock redemptions of $15.7 million and the decrease of $3.6 million in segment no, I the decrease in core FFO was driven by the previously mentioned decrease in segment noi but not impacted by the increase in redeemable preferred stock redemptions. As these are excluded from our core FFO calculation, we can now open the line for questions. Question and Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions) Today's first question comes from John Maoka with B Riley Securities. Please go ahead. Good morning. Maybe he's going up first to the, he's going first to the the preferred conversion. You maybe provide some color on. And the drivers behind the decision to convert those into common equity. And I guess maybe longer term. What's the potential for more conversions going forward? David Thompson Sure, this is David. I'll, take a shot at that and see if you can fill in if I miss anything. I mean, as we noted in our press release and our discussions and we're very focused on strengthening the balance sheet, improving cash flow, focusing on liquidity. You know, we've long said that our target capital structure has about 40% common equity and what we've seen over the last couple of years with the values of real estate going down because of interest rates and particularly for us challenges in the Bay Area, you know, that had gotten out of balance. So this helps us in that regard and it also helps us with again taking more proactive steps to improve cash flow. So we, you know, we save on the the cash preferred dividend by converting it into common. And again, this kind of aligns with some of the other things we we've talked about doing, including, you know, being in the advanced stages of refinancing the hotel and several of our high quality L A office assets. And, and again, to put us in a better position to be, again, focused on strengthening the balance sheet and improving the cash flow, I think, with respect to going forward, I mean, it's something we just have to continue to evaluate, you know, ultimately, that will be a decision of our board, but it's something that we're, we're keeping an eye on and again, don't have a view one way or the other at this point, but it's something where we'll continue to evaluate. Okay. is there a certain kind of conversion price that is off putting to doing more going forward? I mean, you know, the stock obviously has been down significantly, you know, the common equity has been down significantly since the conversion happened. And I don't know if that, you know, if you and the board find that off putting for more conversions going forward or if it's just kind of, this is something that, that needs to happen in order to right size, you know, where you want the balance sheet to be positioned. David Thompson Yeah, I mean, I think they are all factors. We're going to have to look at, we'll have to look at where it's trading. We'll have to look at again, what are the benefits to our liquidity? What are the benefits to begin getting our capital structure back more in line with the target? So it's all going to come into play. And again, ultimately, it will be something the board will have to make a decision on. Okay. And then, you know, in terms of some of the planned future refinancings is there, you know, broad strokes, kind of a range of interest rates, sorry, interest rate savings, you're kind of looking at today as you, as you think about some of those that refinancing activity or is it still, you know, too early. David Thompson Steve If you want to take that? I don't know yet. Steve Altebrando Yeah, I mean, a lot of it is really dependent on the five year which has been pretty volatile of late. But I think more than anything, I think there is an opportunity for interest rate savings, but kind of bigger picture for us is we are shifting our financing strategy more to a property level strategy. And you know, there's certain benefits of that including I think just, just lower overall risk to the enterprise. I think there is an opportunity for some interest rates and things and certainly an opportunity to term out our debt extended maturities. So, that's really the driver behind it is really the, I would say that the shift of the strategy as opposed to the rate Yeah, but having said that I do think there are some, some opportunities to, to reduce rate a little bit. Would you be looking to you know, to create more capital via those refinancings or is it kind of going to be a one for one? And you're just kind of looking to you know, shift stuff positional positionally and then also would the focus be more on fixed or kind of floating? You think at a property level. Steve Altebrando There, there is an Opportunity to free up some capital, our our leverage when you look at just pure debt versus our assets is, is, is pretty low. So there is an opportunity to free up some, some capital and which for respect to, for the most part, we're looking at fixed rate. You know, the exception being the hotel where there's a business plan to our term and with respect to the renovation, in which case, you know, we're looking at refinancing that asset right now and it would be a floater and that, and the benefits of that is, it allows you to basically refinance at a later date and without any restrictions of basically prepayments. And then any kind of other things going forward that could, you know, create additional capital, you know, maybe you know, disposition of assets you're looking at today and or you know, other forms of raising capital now that, you know, the preferred pipeline if you will has been turned off. Steve Altebrando We are really looking across every asset in the portfolio and evaluating whether it makes sense to potentially sell. So I would say everything is on the table on that front. So and we'll we'll continue to you really, really be focused on positioning the portfolio and raising some capital near term positioning the portfolio for growth going forward. Okay? And then one last one for me, sorry, it's a little all over the place given, you know, the direction of the last couple of questions. But if if you did create more capital on the balance sheet today, any thoughts to a buyback just given where the stock is trading? David Thompson I think it's a little Too early. Go ahead Steve. Steve Altebrando Yeah, I think it's a little too early. We're we're still have some wood to chop on the on the refi you know, once we get through that. So the goal is to retire that the credit facility entirely and, and wind up with some additional capital. And, and at that point, you know, we can start evaluating whether you know, something like that makes sense. I appreciate taking questions. That's it for me. Thank you. Thanks John. Operator Thank you. This concludes our question and answer session and the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.
