Therapeutics Announces Initiation of Phase 1a Trial of STAR-0310, a Potential Best-in-Class Monoclonal Antibody OX40 Antagonist for the Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis Business Wire Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 4:00 PM 7 min read In This Article: ATXS -- Early Proof-of-Concept Results from the Phase 1a Trial Anticipated in Q3 2025 -- BOSTON, January 23, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Astria Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATXS), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing life-changing therapies for allergic and immunologic diseases, today announced initiation of a Phase 1a clinical trial of STAR-0310 in healthy subjects. STAR-0310, a high affinity monoclonal antibody OX40 antagonist that incorporates YTE technology, is in development for the potential treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD) and potentially other indications. The Phase 1a trial is intended to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of STAR-0310 in healthy adult participants. Astria expects early proof-of-concept results from the Phase 1a trial in the third quarter of 2025. \"The Phase 1a trial of STAR-0310 in healthy subjects is an important opportunity for us to clinically differentiate the profile of STAR-0310,\" said Jill C. Milne, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer at Astria Therapeutics. \"We believe STAR-0310 will be the best-in-class therapy due to efficacy, safety and tolerability, and treatment burden, and could transform lives for many people living with moderate-to-severe AD.\" The Phase 1a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled single ascending dose trial is evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of STAR-0310 in approximately 40 healthy adult participants. Preclinical results support the potential for STAR-0310 to have the best-in-class OX40 inhibitor profile. By design, there is significantly less antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) with STAR-0310 compared to rocatinlimab, an OX40 antagonist currently in Phase 3 development for the treatment of AD. Reduction in ADCC activity has the potential for a more favorable safety profile and potentially wider therapeutic window for STAR-0310, which we believe provides the potential to drive more efficacy. STAR-0310 exhibits a long mean half-life of 26 days in cynomolgus monkeys, compared to 10-14 days in a typical non-half-life extended IgG1 antibody, and has comparable potency to rocatinlimab.

Design of ALPHA-ORBIT Pivotal Phase 3 Trial of Navenibart in HAE Business Wire Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 4:00 PM 9 min read In This Article: ATXS -- Single Pivotal Trial Designed to Demonstrate Efficacy and Safety of Every 3- and Every 6-Month Administration in a 6-Month Treatment Period -- -- Pioneering Patient-Centric Dosing Flexibility in HAE with Potential Market-Leading First-Choice Profile -- -- Phase 3 Initiation On-Track, Expected in Q1 2025 -- -- Strong Financial Position, Funded Through Expected Top-Line Phase 3 Results -- BOSTON, January 13, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Astria Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATXS), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing life-changing therapies for allergic and immunologic diseases, today announced its planned design of the ALPHA-ORBIT Phase 3 clinical trial of navenibart in people with hereditary angioedema (HAE), which will include both every 3- (Q3M) and every 6-month (Q6M) treatment arms with the primary analysis at 6 months. Global start-up activities are underway, and ALPHA-ORBIT is expected to initiate in Q1 2025, with top-line results anticipated in early 2027. \"We are thrilled to announce our planned Phase 3 design, which reflects feedback from regulators and is intended to support global registration for both Q3M and Q6M administration,\" said Jill C. Milne, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer at Astria. \"With navenibart, we are pioneering patient-centric dosing flexibility in HAE with the goal of maximizing attack rate reduction with a compellingly low burden of treatment. Assuming approval, we believe navenibart will become the market-leading, first-choice therapy for HAE.\" \"Our Phase 3 program was designed in collaboration with the patient community and physicians, is based on input from global regulatory authorities, and addresses the importance of providing options to patients for a disease that\u2019s highly variable,\" said Christopher Morabito, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Astria. \"Phase 3 preparations are underway, with trial initiation on-track and expected for this quarter. We are driven by the goal of bringing a potentially life-changing therapy to patients with HAE.\" ALPHA-ORBIT is designed as a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of navenibart over a 6-month treatment period in up to 145 patients with Type 1 or Type 2 HAE. Patients will be randomized to receive one of three navenibart dose arms: 1) an initial 600 mg dose and followed by 300 mg Q3M, 2) 600 mg Q6M, and 3) 600 mg Q3M, or placebo. The dose arms support the potential to provide patient-centric dosing flexibility to people with HAE. The primary endpoint is time-normalized monthly HAE attacks at 6 months, and a key secondary endpoint includes the proportion of participants who are attack-free at 6 months. After 6 months, patients may be eligible to enter a long-term extension trial, in which all patients will be treated with navenibart (open-label) and which will include an open-label, patient-centric flexible dosing period. The navenibart Phase 3 program will consist of the ALPHA-ORBIT Phase 3 trial and the long-term extension trial, which are designed to support registration globally. The Phase 3 program was designed with input from the European Medicines Agency and the Company\u2019s end of Phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) held in December 2024. Story Continues Planned doses for the Phase 3 ALPHA-ORBIT program were selected based on positive final top-line results from target enrollment in the Phase 1b/2 ALPHA-STAR trial of navenibart, announced in December 2024, which showed rapid onset of robust and durable efficacy, favorable safety and tolerability, and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics consistent with sustained plasma kallikrein inhibition for both Q3M and Q6M administration. Final results included reduction in mean monthly attack rate of 90-95% and up to a 67% attack-free rate over 6 months. The Company will present these data at an upcoming scientific conference. Additional details regarding the Company\u2019s planned Phase 3 program and other business updates are contained in the Company\u2019s Corporate Presentation, which is available on the \"Events and Presentations\" page of the \"For Investors\" section of the Company\u2019s website.

Final 3- and 6-Month Results from the ALPHA-STAR Trial of Navenibart Expected in Q4 2024 -- -- STAR-0310 Investigational New Drug (IND) Application Submission On-Track for Year-End 2024 -- -- Phase 1a Trial of STAR-0310 in Healthy Subjects Expected to Initiate in Q1 2025 -- BOSTON, November 13, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Astria Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATXS), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing life-changing therapies for allergic and immunologic diseases, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a corporate update. \"We had another strong quarter of execution for both navenibart and STAR-0310,\" said Jill C. Milne, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer at Astria Therapeutics. \"We are excited about the opportunity for navenibart to be the market-leading therapy for HAE. We expect that navenibart\u2019s profile, including infrequent dosing, low risk of pain, and trusted mechanism and modality, will give both patients and physicians confidence when choosing a medicine for HAE. We are engaged with regulators on finalizing our Phase 3 design and have manufactured clinical supplies for the Phase 3, which we expect to initiate in Q1 2025. STAR-0310 is also progressing as planned. We are on track with our IND submission before year-end and plan to initiate a Phase 1a trial in Q1 2025. We are intentionally designing the STAR-0310 program to capitalize on the learnings and address the liabilities of other OX40 and OX40L therapies to create what we believe will be the best-overall OX40 program. We plan to maintain this momentum and are looking forward to an exciting 2025.\" Navenibart (STAR-0215) Navenibart was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Orphan Medicinal Product Designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of HAE. Astria is in discussion with global regulatory authorities and is finalizing the design for the Phase 3 trial of navenibart in people with HAE. Clinical supplies have been manufactured and are ready to support the Phase 3 trial. Pending regulatory feedback, the Company plans to initiate the Phase 3 program in Q1 2025 and expects top-line results by year-end 2026. The goal is to enable patients to choose what works best for them by developing both Q3M and Q6M dosing options. The Company believes navenibart will be life-changing for HAE patients and has the opportunity to become the market leading HAE treatment. Initial proof-of-concept results from the ALPHA-STAR Phase 1b/2 trial of navenibart in people with HAE demonstrate that administration of navenibart once or twice over six months reduced monthly attack rates by 90-96% in HAE patients at 3 and 6 months, supporting the potential for chronic administration of navenibart two or four times per year. Additionally, navenibart was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events and no discontinuations. The Company plans to report final data from ALPHA-STAR target enrollment in Q4 of 2024. All of the original 16 target enrollment patients from ALPHA-STAR have entered the ALPHA-SOLAR long-term open-label trial. Initial safety and efficacy data from ALPHA-SOLAR, with Q3M and Q6M administration, are expected mid-2025. Astria presented initial results from the ALPHA-STAR trial of navenibart at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venerology in September 2024 and Global Angioedema Forum (GAF) in October 2024 in Copenhagen, Denmark. Astria also presented the design of the ALPHA-SOLAR Long-Term Open-Label trial at GAF. Results presented at the American College of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) conference in October 2024 and the Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (CSACI) conference in November 2024 demonstrated that navenibart induced rapid improvements in Quality of Life (QoL) and HAE attack rates in patients in the ALPHA-STAR trial. Story Continues STAR-0310 Astria is developing STAR-0310, a high affinity monoclonal antibody OX40 antagonist that incorporates YTE technology, for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). Preclinical results support the potential for STAR-0310 to have the best-in-class OX40 inhibitor profile. STAR-0310 exhibits a long mean half-life of 26 days in cynomolgus monkeys, compared to 10-14 days in a typical non-half-life extended IgG1 antibody, and has comparable potency to rocatinlimab. Additionally, by design there is significantly less antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) with STAR-0310 compared to rocatinlimab. Reduction in ADCC activity has the potential for a more favorable safety profile and potentially wider therapeutic window for STAR-0310. Astria is on track with our IND submission to FDA for STAR-0310 before year-end 2024 and plans to initiate a Phase 1a clinical trial in healthy subjects in the first quarter of 2025, with early proof-of-concept results expected in the third quarter of 2025. Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results Cash Position: As of September 30, 2024, Astria had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $344.3 million, compared to $246.5 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company expects that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund its operations into mid-2027, including all navenibart program activities through the completion of a planned Phase 3 pivotal trial as well as advancing the STAR-0310 OX40 program through submission of an IND and early proof-of-concept results from a Phase 1a clinical trial. Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $28.0 million, compared to $14.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses were $20.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $13.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily associated with the STAR-0310 program\u2019s manufacturing and IND-enabling activities in addition to an increase in external expenses to support a planned Phase 3 pivotal trial for navenibart. G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses were $8.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $6.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses was attributable to stock-based compensation and company growth to support the advancement of our programs. Operating Loss: Loss from operations was $29.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $20.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net Loss: Net loss was $24.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $17.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net Loss Per Share Basic and Diluted: Net loss per share basic and diluted was $0.42 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss basic and diluted of $0.63 per share for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Astria Therapeutics Announces Positive Final Results from Target Enrollment in the ALPHA-STAR Phase 1b/2 Trial of Navenibart for HAE Business Wire Wed, Dec 11, 2024, 4:00 PM 9 min read In This Article: ATXS -- Navenibart Demonstrated 6 Months of HAE Attack Prevention with 1 or 2 Doses -- -- 90-95% Mean Monthly Attack Rate Reduction Supporting Chronic Dosing 2 or 4 Times Per Year -- -- 67% Attack-Free Rate Over 6 Months in Cohorts 2 and 3 -- -- Favorable Safety and Well-Tolerated Profile -- -- Phase 3 Initiation on Track for Q1 2025 -- BOSTON, December 11, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Astria Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATXS), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing life-changing therapies for allergic and immunologic diseases, today announced positive final results from the target enrollment group of 16 patients in the ALPHA-STAR Phase 1b/2 clinical trial evaluating navenibart (STAR-0215), a monoclonal antibody inhibitor of plasma kallikrein, in hereditary angioedema (HAE) patients. These final results demonstrated reduction in the mean monthly attack rate of 90-95% at 6 months, favorable safety and tolerability profile, and support both every three- (Q3M) and every six-month (Q6M) dosing regimens. The results underscore the potential of navenibart\u2019s profile to be the market-leading therapy for HAE. Astria is advancing navenibart to Phase 3 development with trial initiation expected in Q1 2025. \"The results from the ALPHA-STAR Phase 1b/2 trial affirm our belief in navenibart\u2019s profile and its potential to be a life-changing, market-leading preventative treatment for HAE patients,\" said Christopher Morabito, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Astria Therapeutics. \"After one or two doses over six months, patients experienced rapid onset of robust and durable efficacy, favorable safety and tolerability, and PK and PD that are consistent with sustained plasma kallikrein inhibition and Q3M and Q6M administration. These results are highly consistent with the interim results we reported in March. We look forward to presenting these data at an upcoming scientific conference and expect to initiate Phase 3 development in Q1, pending completion of discussions with global regulators.\" \"These results from the ALPHA-STAR trial are exciting for the future of the HAE treatment landscape,\" said Dr. Aleena Banerji, Clinical Director MGH Allergy and Clinical Immunology Unit. \"We understand from people living with HAE that the disease and treatment burden can weigh heavily on their physical and mental health. I am optimistic that a therapy with infrequent dosing, a well-tolerated profile, and a trusted mechanism and modality could alleviate the burden for patients.\" ALPHA-STAR is a dose-ranging proof-of-concept trial in adults with HAE Type 1 or 2 designed to assess safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and quality of life in patients receiving single and multiple doses of navenibart in three cohorts delivered subcutaneously to prevent attacks in HAE. All cohorts began with an eight-week run-in period to measure baseline HAE attacks and safety, efficacy, PK, and PD are assessed through 6-months (Day 168) after the last dose received. Among the target enrollment (n=16), 88% had Type 1 HAE, the average age was 46 years, and 56% were female. Story Continues Cohort 1 evaluated a 450 mg dose (n=4). Results show that, on average, over 6 months: 91% reduction in monthly attack rate 96% reduction in moderate and severe attacks 94% reduction in acute rescue medication use 50% of patients were attack-free through 3 months of follow-up, and 25% were attack-free through 6 months of follow-up Cohort 2 evaluated a 600 mg dose followed by a 300 mg dose three months later (n=6). Results show that, on average, over 6 months: 95% reduction in monthly attack rate 95% reduction in moderate and severe attacks 94% reduction in acute rescue medication use 67% of patients were attack-free Cohort 3 evaluated a 600 mg dose followed by a 600 mg dose one month later (n=6). Results show that, on average, over 6 months: 92% reduction in monthly attack rate 96% reduction in moderate and severe attacks 91% reduction in acute rescue medication use 67% of patients were attack-free PK and PD were consistent with previously reported results and demonstrated rapid and sustained target plasma kallikrein inhibition consistent with effective and safe Q3M and Q6M administration. Navenibart was generally well-tolerated with no serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and no discontinuations. There were four non-severe and quickly resolved treatment-related TEAEs: one case of dizziness, a transient injection site reaction (rash), an injection site erythema, and an injection site pruritus. There were no injection site reactions of pain. The results shared above are available in the Company\u2019s corporate presentation in the investor section of www.astriatx.com . The Company expects to present these data at an upcoming scientific conference. All 16 patients have enrolled into ALPHA-SOLAR, a long-term open-label trial. Initial safety and efficacy data from Q3M and Q6M dosing in the ALPHA-SOLAR trial are expected mid-2025. Pending regulatory feedback, the Company plans to initiate the Phase 3 program in Q1 2025 and expects topline results by year-end 2026.

December 10, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Astria Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:ATXS), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing life-changing therapies for allergic and immunologic diseases, today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance of its Investigational New Drug (IND) application for STAR-0310, a monoclonal antibody OX40 antagonist, the company is developing as a potential treatment for atopic dermatitis (AD) and potentially other indications. A Phase 1a trial of STAR-0310 in healthy subjects is expected to initiate in the first quarter of 2025, with early proof-of-concept results expected in the third quarter of 2025. Further, the company anticipates proof-of-concept results in atopic dermatitis patients in the second quarter of 2026. \"We are pleased with the FDA\u2019s acceptance of our IND application for STAR-0310 and the progress it represents for the program,\" said Chris Morabito, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Astria Therapeutics. \"We are very excited about the potential for the OX40 mechanism. With the goal of creating the overall best OX40 program, we intentionally have designed STAR-0310 to capitalize on the learnings of OX40 receptor and OX40 ligand programs. STAR-0310's high affinity and high potency in conjunction with low ADCC has the potential to enable a wider therapeutic window, and additionally, STAR-0310 has the potential to be dosed as infrequently as every six months due to its long half-life and potential for disease modification.\" About Astria Therapeutics: Astria Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company, and our mission is to bring life-changing therapies to patients and families affected by allergic and immunologic diseases.
