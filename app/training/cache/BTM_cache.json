[{"text": "This Bitcoin Depot Insider Increased Their Holding In The Last Year editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sun, Jan 26, 2025, 4:16 PM 3 min read In This Article: BTM BTMWW Looking at Bitcoin Depot Inc.'s ( NASDAQ:BTM ) insider transactions over the last year, we can see that insiders were net buyers. That is, there were more number of shares purchased by insiders than there were sold. While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Bitcoin Depot The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Bitcoin Depot Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by insider Andrew Paul for US$228k worth of shares, at about US$1.70 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at around the current price of US$1.79. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. While we always like to see insider buying, it's less meaningful if the purchases were made at much lower prices, as the opportunity they saw may have passed. Happily, the Bitcoin Depot insider decided to buy shares at close to current prices. Andrew Paul was the only individual insider to buy shares in the last twelve months. Andrew Paul purchased 155.79k shares over the year. The average price per share was US$1.65.

The relationship allows Events to draw on the 25 years of experience Sidoti has as a premier provider of independent securities research focused specifically on small and microcap companies and the institutions that invest in their securities, with most of its coverage in the $200 million-$5 billion market cap range. Sidoti's coverage universe comprises approximately 150 equities of which greater than 60 percent participate in the firm's rapidly growing Company Sponsored Research (\"CSR\") program. In 2024, Sidoti established Lighthouse Equity Research as an extension of its CSR program to meet the specific needs of companies not valued using traditional metrics or that face challenges obtaining coverage due to political risks or other factors. Events is a leading provider of corporate access through the eight investor conferences it hosts each year. By virtue of its direct ties to Sidoti, Event's benefits from Sidoti's small- and microcap-focused nationwide sales force, which has connections with 2,500 institutional relationships in North America.

Fair Value Of BTM Resources Berhad (KLSE:BTM) editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sat, Jan 18, 2025, 3:04 AM 6 min read Key Insights Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, BTM Resources Berhad fair value estimate is RM0.039 BTM Resources Berhad's RM0.045 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate Industry average of 1,200% suggests BTM Resources Berhad's peers are currently trading at a higher premium to fair value In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of BTM Resources Berhad ( KLSE:BTM ) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward. Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model . Check out our latest analysis for BTM Resources Berhad Crunching The Numbers We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Seeing as no analyst estimates of free cash flow are available to us, we have extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the company's last reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF (MYR, Millions) RM3.23m RM3.55m RM3.84m RM4.10m RM4.34m RM4.57m RM4.78m RM4.99m RM5.19m RM5.40m Growth Rate Estimate Source Est @ 12.95% Est @ 10.14% Est @ 8.17% Est @ 6.79% Est @ 5.83% Est @ 5.15% Est @ 4.68% Est @ 4.35% Est @ 4.12% Est @ 3.96% Present Value (MYR, Millions) Discounted @ 11% RM2.9 RM2.9 RM2.8 RM2.7 RM2.5 RM2.4 RM2.3 RM2.1 RM2.0 RM1.9 (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = RM24m The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (3.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 11%. Story Continues Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = RM5.4m\u00d7 (1 + 3.6%) \u00f7 (11%\u2013 3.6%) = RM72m Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = RM72m\u00f7 ( 1 + 11%) 10 = RM25m The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is RM49m. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of RM0.04, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. KLSE:BTM Discounted Cash Flow January 18th 2025 The Assumptions We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at BTM Resources Berhad as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.384. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for BTM Resources Berhad Strength Debt is not viewed as a risk. Weakness Current share price is above our estimate of fair value. Opportunity Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows. Lack of analyst coverage makes it difficult to determine BTM's earnings prospects. Threat No apparent threats visible for BTM. Looking Ahead: Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

TikTok ban as users seek alternatives to the ByteDance-owned app Kalhan Rosenblatt Updated Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 7:53 PM 4 min read TikTok users are pushing back against the looming TikTok ban set to potentially go into effect Sunday by downloading a Chinese app called RedNote, which some users are calling \u201c China\u2019s TikTok .\u201d TikTok\u2019s ban was largely derived from national security concerns related to TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, and many users are moving to RedNote as an explicit form of protest. Known as Xiaohongshu in China, RedNote is a social media platform that includes images, short-form videos, community building tools, shopping and more. It is not a one-to-one TikTok clone, and it is not owned by ByteDance. It is owned by Shanghai-based Xingyin Information Technology. American TikTokers who fear losing the platform have suggested their followers join them in downloading RedNote to send a message to the U.S. government, as well as the social media company Meta, which stands to gain new users of its TikTok-like product, Reels, if the ban goes into effect. Meta reportedly used a Republican lobbying firm to spread ill will toward TikTok in 2022. Some have said that following a ban, they are prepared to do weeklong Meta blackouts, meaning they will not use any Meta apps, such as Instagram and Facebook. On Monday, RedNote was the top free-to-download app on the Apple App Store, followed by TikTok\u2019s sister app Lemon8. Users say that while they wait to see whether the U.S. Supreme Court will give TikTok an eleventh-hour reprieve, they plan to use RedNote if TikTok goes away Sunday. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about RedNote. What is RedNote, and what are people saying about it? RedNote is a Shanghai-based Chinese-language social media app that offers a little bit of everything Americans are used to in a social media app. Users can share videos, post pictures, make text posts and access a host of shopping features. The interface is different from TikTok\u2019s in that a video does not immediately start playing upon the app\u2019s opening and users must log in to begin using it. However, it is similar in that it serves content it thinks each user will like. Although RedNote has been available in English, some users reported Monday that it appeared to be more accessible for its American user base as its popularity grew. Some posts Monday on RedNote welcomed \u201cTikTok refugees\u201d to the platform. Other users joked about meeting their TikTok-designated \u201cChinese spy\u201d on RedNote, with some Chinese users chiming in that they were happy to find their American counterparts. How are memes driving people to the platform? On TikTok, some videos of people joking about saying goodbye to their \u201cChinese spy\u201d (some in Mandarin) have racked up millions of views and likes. The memes are part of a deeper resentment some users feel toward the U.S. government for moving to ban TikTok in the name of security and safety even though some lawmakers use it themselves, as well as toward the continued politicization of other social media companies, like X and Meta. Story Continues The anger was on full display on TikTok as some explained why they were downloading RedNote. \u201cI\u2019m going to download it on my phone. I\u2019m going to let it track other apps. I\u2019m going to give it permission to see my location and all of my contacts and then I\u2019m just going to let it sit there,\u201d a TikTok user posted. \u201cI\u2019m going to let it sit there as a little window through which my personal Chinese spy can see everything that I\u2019m doing.\u201d Others had a more somber tone discussing their decisions to download RedNote, suggesting the U.S. government\u2019s intention was to hurt its people, many of whom have built large followings and full-time careers on TikTok. \u201cOur government, I\u2019m convinced, loves and thrives seeing us unhappy and seeing us struggle and seeing us poor,\u201d another TikToker said. \u201cSeeing that RedNote, another Chinese app, which is owned and hosted in China, is the No. 1 app in the App Store today is just beautiful.\u201d When was RedNote released? RedNote launched in 2013. While it grew steadily over the years, its biggest boom came during the pandemic, which is when it rose in popularity. How many users are on the app? RedNote has 300 million monthly active users, according to TechCrunch . TechCrunch reported that women are 79% of the user base. Could RedNote be banned like TikTok? Like TikTok and Lemon8, the short answer appears to be yes \u2014 however, it is not as straightforward as it is for TikTok and Lemon8, whose parent company, ByteDance, is named in the law. Experts noted that the law gives the executive branch the authority to deem a country a \u201cforeign adversary\u201d and that in doing so it can choose to ban an app that comes from that country. In this case, China is already deemed a \u201cforeign adversary\u201d in the TikTok ban, and therefore the executive branch could theoretically decide that other apps from China must be banned. But lawmakers who crafted the bill said in interviews with The Washington Post that while it could be used for foreign-controlled social media platforms, the core intention of the ban was to target TikTok and its sister applications.

"Tallarna Secures a Contract with InnSure Under the Insurance Innovation Prize Business Wire Thu, Jan 16, 2025, 6:02 PM 4 min read Tallarna has secured a contract to develop a performance insurance product for Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and solar PV deployed across commercial real estate. This product will protect technologies\u2019 economic outcomes, empowering Tallarna\u2019s fully-funded Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS) subscription offering across New York State. By underpinning BESS and solar PVs\u2019 cash flows with investment-grade insurance, Tallarna gives stakeholders the confidence to decarbonize at scale. NEW YORK & LONDON & STOCKHOLM, January 16, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Tallarna , a climate tech and finance platform for sustainable impact, today announced it has secured a significant contract under the New York State-based Insurance Innovation Prize . This initiative is administered by InnSure and supported by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) . Tallarna has been contracted to create a data-led, performance insurance product that protects the economic outcomes of BESS and solar PV deployed across commercial real estate. This represents a significant milestone in the company\u2019s continued product and market expansion. Called Energy Infrastructure Insurance (EII), this pioneering product will de-risk the adoption of BESS and solar PV \u2013 protecting these technologies in isolation and together. This will lower the cost of capital for fully-funded EaaS projects by transferring significant risks away from funders. In doing so, off-takers will gain increasingly attractive EaaS subscription prices. EII will be integral to Tallarna\u2019s EaaS offering, which will give commercial building owners and occupiers the guaranteed availability, performance, and economic outcomes of clean energy technologies without the risks or costs of ownership. Technologies\u2019 financial benefits will exceed the subscription fee, turning decarbonization into a financial imperative. Part of EII\u2019s innovation will be its use of data in identifying, scoping, and managing risk. Tallarna will collaborate with a software analytics provider to ensure effective scenario modeling, operational control, and real-time metering & monitoring across these energy assets\u2019 lifetimes. Such granular, data-driven insights will enhance insurers\u2019 understanding of the risks facing these technologies, inform proactive maintenance to mitigate against loss events, enable cover to dynamically adapt to changes in technology use, and accelerate claims payment. This data-led approach will support EII to comprehensively address the specific and complex risks facing BESS and solar PV deployment in commercial real estate. These technologies produce a sophisticated revenue stack, both Behind-the-Meter (BTM) and Front-of-the-Meter (FTM), on which stakeholders\u2019 returns depend. By uniquely underpinning these cash flows with a holistic, investment-grade, and long-term insurance product, Tallarna will make large-scale action possible. Story Continues Designed with input from Tallarna\u2019s panel of funding partners, technology providers, insurers, developers, and commercial real estate customers, EII will cover five key risks: Shortfall Indemnity: Protects against the difference between BESS and solar PVs\u2019 expected and actual cash flows due to technology underperformance. Revenue Cap and Collar: Delivers minimum price certainty for FTM merchant revenues in exchange for an upfront premium and an upside revenue share. Defect, Breakdown, and Design Fault: Covers the repair and replacement of installed systems, including parts and labor, for the entirety of EaaS projects\u2019 contract term. Fire: Provides cover against first and third-party property damage risks, including that caused by thermal runaway in BESS. Lack of Irradiance: Compensates for reduced energy generation due to periods of insufficient sunlight. By integrating these elements of cover, Tallarna will protect against the major and material risks facing these technologies for up to 15 years. At the end of this contract, Tallarna will have commercialized a new, data-led performance insurance product across New York State. \"Overcoming the financial uncertainty facing clean energy technologies is key to driving a sustainable, profitable future for people and the planet,\" commented Rupert Dixon , Director of Insurance at Tallarna. \"We are excited for this collaboration \u2013 our first with InnSure and our third with NYSERDA \u2013 to create an insurance product that offers stakeholders the robust, dynamic, and comprehensive cover required to decarbonize at scale.\" \"Insurance is a powerful risk management tool that is instrumental to scaling technology adoption across various industries,\" added Christopher Lowell , Managing Director at InnSure. \"Tallarna\u2019s EII exemplifies how insurance can lead efforts to incentivize climate action by defending the financial outcomes of projects.\" View source version on businesswire.com:

the past three years editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Tue, Jan 7, 2025, 8:58 AM 3 min read In This Article: BTM.SI One simple way to benefit from the stock market is to buy an index fund. But if you choose individual stocks with prowess, you can make superior returns. For example, the Penguin International Limited ( SGX:BTM ) share price is up 32% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 4.6% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 2.7% in the last year, including dividends. With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Penguin International To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement. Penguin International was able to grow its EPS at 21% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 10% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 11.38 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock. You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). SGX:BTM Earnings Per Share Growth January 7th 2025 Dive deeper into Penguin International's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Penguin International's earnings, revenue and cash flow . What About Dividends? As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Penguin International's TSR for the last 3 years was 46%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments! A Different Perspective Penguin International provided a TSR of 2.7% over the last twelve months. But that was short of the market average. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 6% over five years. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Penguin International better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 4 warning signs for Penguin International (of which 2 can't be ignored!) you should know about.

Equity Research Coverage GlobeNewswire \u00b7 GlobeNewswire Inc. Texas Capital Bancshares, Inc. Thu, Jan 9, 2025, 1:20 AM 4 min read In This Article: TCBI TCBIO Coverage begins with 38 companies in the U.S. upstream, agribusiness, biofuel and energy adjacent sectors DALLAS, Jan. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Texas Capital Securities, a subsidiary of Texas Capital Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ: TCBI), today announced it has initiated coverage of 38 companies in the energy and energy-adjacent sectors. The newly formed Equity Research team will enhance the firm\u2019s product and service capabilities, investment insights and dedicated coverage of the energy industry and adjacent sectors, while also providing a platform to further expand its Institutional Services business. \u201cToday\u2019s coverage initiations continue the strategic expansion of our specialized product offerings to support clients active in the equity markets and focused on transformative opportunities in the energy and adjacent sectors,\u201d said Daniel Hoverman, Head of Corporate & Investment Banking. \u201cLooking forward to 2025, we intend to continue expanding our coverage universe to complement our industry-focused coverage teams, including our leading corporate banking practices in Healthcare, Technology, Media & Telecom, Diversified Industries, and Financial Institutions, and to establish Texas Capital as the \u2018first call\u2019 for small- and mid-cap U.S.-listed public companies. We believe our full service platform offers both issuers and equity investors a valuable combination of expertise, advisory services and capital, resulting in a differentiated client experience, market connectivity, investor access and strategic advice. Our decision to launch Equity Research in the Energy sectors stands as testament to our dedication to serving an important sector of the Texas and U.S. economy and the exciting prospects facing the industry thanks to AI-driven data center demand, the expansion of U.S. liquified natural gas infrastructure, and policy-driven growth in biofuels.\u201d Initial coverage will focus on three core areas: Upstream Energy: The sector remains market leading on return of capital metrics and has re-rate potential for companies with meaningful natural gas exposure. Coverage includes 23 stocks, including 17 Exploration and Production (E&P) companies, four Mineral and Royalty companies and two Minerals-like MLPs. Energy Adjacent: These sectors are positioned to capitalize on transformative trends such as AI data center power demand growth, the buildout of liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and tightening water handling fundamentals in the Delaware Basin. Coverage includes eight stocks, including land management and royalty companies, water handling operators, natural gas contract compression operators, clean energy technology and a behind-the-meter power (BTM) generation provider. Agribusiness and Biofuels: These companies are poised to benefit from an evolving U.S. renewable fuel policy landscape. Coverage includes seven stocks, including three vertically integrated Renewable Diesel (RD) - Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) operators, three vertically integrated renewable natural gas (RNG) operators and one global agribusiness and food company. Story Continues \u201cAssuming the Trump Administration maintains its \u2018all of the above\u2019 energy policy, we believe that policy could accomplish the trifecta of strengthening the domestic economy, providing global energy security and lowering energy emissions,\u201d said Derrick Whitfield, Head of Energy Equity Research. \u201cPerhaps most importantly for investors, the U.S., and the Permian Basin more specifically, has the opportunity to become ground zero for the global AI data center buildout based on its abundant, low-cost natural gas, access to water for cooling, renewable power integration, and ample land to build necessary utilities.\u201d As Texas Capital continues to grow, the firm remains dedicated to delivering exceptional value to its clients, ensuring they have access to the information and resources necessary to make informed decisions in an ever-evolving market landscape.

electric power sector is undergoing a digital transformation with mobile applications playing a crucial role by enabling real-time data sharing and more efficient grid management. Innovative technology is supporting utilities\u2019 efforts to modernize infrastructure, enhance operations, and transition to renewable energy sources. The electric utility sector is undergoing an unprecedented energy transition that requires reducing carbon emissions, promoting decentralization, and increasing the digitalization of workflows. These changes significantly affect electrical distribution, especially with the rise of behind-the-meter (BTM) systems. Utilities\u2019 future success hinges on their ability to address these challenges holistically and cost-effectively. Utilities must implement automated work procedures that use shared data and adaptable tools throughout the life of the electric grid. Work process digitalization instantaneously gives field staff access to work order data and enables monitoring of back-office work progress in real time. Field crews equipped with these digital technologies are necessary to optimize the operation of modern electrical distribution systems. The Network Lifecycle The electrical distribution network lifecycle has four phases: plan, build, operate, and respond (Figure 1). Each phase requires process optimization and integration with systems such as geographic information system (GIS), workforce management system (WMS), and outage management system (OMS), as well as the ability to access them from the field. Mobile applications support the network lifecycle by digitalizing the process of sharing data and optimizing previously manual data-handling processes, which enhances productivity and cuts costs. 1. The four phases of the utility network lifecycle. Courtesy: IQGeo Plan Your Network. The plan phase boosts situational awareness through mobile apps and their ability to share real-time data with operational systems. The network is updated dynamically using digital design tools that optimize fieldwork processes. Mobile apps enable field crews to digitally perform staking, field design, construction estimates, and drawing mark-ups, making the process more efficient and productive. Build Your Network. In the build phase, mobile apps improve data quality for construction teams and streamline the preparation of as-built drawings. Field crews also use mobile apps to record updated field data for engineering and management. This accelerates the build process and better manages changes in a dynamic work environment. Operate and Maintain Your Network. In the operate and maintain phase, field crews use mobile apps to receive geo-enabled work orders to shorten response times. Smart forms are customizable for task and workforce planning, and may be integrated with advanced distribution management systems (ADMS) and OMS. Field crews can also update as-built drawings, GIS databases, and asset inspection reports online and offline, enabling efficient network operation and maintenance. Respond and Repair Your Network. Mobile applications are used in the response and repair phase to accelerate service restoration without compromising field crew safety. For example, field crews can view affected areas on a tablet, which facilitates faster workforce activation during disaster response incidents. Further, mobile apps allow field crews to update system status in real time. In return, headquarters can also keep field crews informed of any changes in network or environmental conditions. Story Continues Business Case for Mobile Applications 2. UK-based IQGeo\u2019s field mobility software framework provides a valuable perspective for assessing and addressing significant challenges associated with grid modernization. Courtesy: IQGeo Mobile applications are essential during the entire network lifecycle, particularly for enabling grid modernization projects and decision-making during design, construction, maintenance, and operations. IQGeo\u2019s mobility software (Figure 2) delivers measurable and compelling business value across the five critical operational benchmarks summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Five critical operational benchmarks for electrical utilities deploying mobile applications. Source: IQGeo Many utilities have heavily invested in mobile applications as they significantly enhance productivity, optimize resource use, improve the field user experience, and ensure the reliable delivery of services to customers. The following case studies briefly illustrate different approaches to mobile geospatial applications. Case Study 1. A northwest U.S. utility serving one million customers relies on mobile geospatial solutions for electrical distribution operations. Field crews use IQGeo on iPads to access and update grid data in real time, reducing delays in as-built updates from months to immediate onsite entries (Figure 3). The utility envisions a comprehensive \u201cSuper App\u201d that integrates real-time circuit data, emergency response, and distributed energy resources (DER) functions to improve efficiency, safety, and decision-making. 3. Field crews equipped with mobile devices running IQGeo allow as-built updates to be completed before leaving the job site. Courtesy: IQGeo Case Study 2. A northeastern U.S. utility is upgrading its interconnection processes to achieve 50% renewable energy by 2030, focusing on DERs, energy storage, and electric vehicle (EV) charging. Field crews utilize iPads for the purpose of asset inspection and data collection, thereby enhancing maintenance procedures. Furthermore, the organization integrates drones with mobile applications to facilitate the process of data collection and mapping, thereby streamlining operations and optimizing efficiency. Case Study 3. A utility department in a California city is using a mobile GIS solution to work more efficiently and share asset data with other departments. The project aims to help the utility make better decisions by giving its staff real-time access to location-based data on their mobile devices. Empower Grid Modernization with a Mobile Geospatial Strategy Utilities must fully embrace the digital transformation of their assets and workforce to remain competitive. Mobile applications will have a crucial role in digitalizing their workflows. By harnessing the power of mobile technology, utilities can enhance communication, streamline workflows, and optimize operations.
