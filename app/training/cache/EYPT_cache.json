[{"text": "Strong week for EyePoint Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:EYPT) shareholders doesn't alleviate pain of one-year loss editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sat, Jan 25, 2025, 3:35 PM 3 min read In This Article: EYPT -6.27% EyePoint Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( NASDAQ:EYPT ) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 16% in the last month. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last year have been disappointing. Specifically, the stock price slipped by 68% in that time. Some might say the recent bounce is to be expected after such a bad drop. You could argue that the sell-off was too severe. On a more encouraging note the company has added US$74m to its market cap in just the last 7 days, so let's see if we can determine what's driven the one-year loss for shareholders. View our latest analysis for EyePoint Pharmaceuticals EyePoint Pharmaceuticals isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing. Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. That's because fast revenue growth can be easily extrapolated to forecast profits, often of considerable size. In the last year EyePoint Pharmaceuticals saw its revenue grow by 7.5%. That's not a very high growth rate considering it doesn't make profits. Without profits, and with revenue growth sluggish, you get a 68% loss for shareholders, over the year. Like many holders, we really want to see better revenue growth in companies that lose money. Of course, the market can be too impatient at times. Why not take a closer look at this one so you're ready to pounce if growth does accelerate. The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). NasdaqGM:EYPT Earnings and Revenue Growth January 25th 2025 We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. If you are thinking of buying or selling EyePoint Pharmaceuticals stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts . A Different Perspective EyePoint Pharmaceuticals shareholders are down 68% for the year, but the market itself is up 27%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 9% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should \"buy when there is blood on the streets\", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand EyePoint Pharmaceuticals better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - EyePoint Pharmaceuticals has 3 warning signs (and 1 which can't be ignored) we think you should know about.

About EyePoint Pharmaceuticals EyePoint Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: EYPT) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing and commercializing innovative therapeutics to help improve the lives of patients with serious retinal diseases. The Company's pipeline leverages its proprietary bioerodible Durasert E\u2122 technology for sustained intraocular drug delivery. The Company\u2019s lead product candidate, DURAVYU\u2122 (f/k/a EYP-1901), is an investigational sustained delivery treatment for VEGF-mediated retinal diseases combining vorolanib, a selective and patent-protected tyrosine kinase inhibitor with bioerodible Durasert E\u2122. DURAVYU is presently in Phase 3 global, pivotal clinical trials as a sustained delivery treatment for wet AMD, the leading cause of vision loss among people 50 years of age and older in the United States, and in a Phase 2 clinical trial in DME. EyePoint expects full topline data from the Phase 2 clinical trial in DME in Q1 2025 and topline data from both Phase 3 pivotal trials in wet AMD in 2026. Pipeline programs include EYP-2301, a TIE-2 agonist, razuprotafib, formulated in Durasert E\u2122 to potentially improve outcomes in serious retinal diseases. The proven Durasert\u00ae drug delivery technology has been safely administered to thousands of patient eyes across four U.S. FDA approved products. EyePoint Pharmaceuticals is headquartered in Watertown, Massachusetts. Story Continues Vorolanib is licensed to EyePoint exclusively by Equinox Sciences, a Betta Pharmaceuticals affiliate, for the localized treatment of all ophthalmic diseases outside of China, Macao, Hong Kong and Taiwan. DURAVYU\u2122 has been conditionally accepted by the FDA as the proprietary name for EYP-1901. DURAVYU is an investigational product; it has not been approved by the FDA. FDA approval and the timeline for potential approval is uncertain.

Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco on Tuesday, January 14, 2025 at 2:15 p.m. PT \u2013 WATERTOWN, Mass., Jan. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EyePoint Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: EYPT), a company committed to developing and commercializing innovative therapeutics to improve the lives of patients with serious retinal diseases, today provided a company update and anticipated 2025 milestones for its lead product candidate, DURAVYU\u2122\u00a0(vorolanib intravitreal insert), f/k/a EYP-1901. DURAVYU is an investigational sustained delivery therapy delivering patent-protected vorolanib, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) formulated in proprietary bioerodible Durasert E\u2122 for sustained intraocular delivery. \u201c2024 was an exceptional year for EyePoint, positioning us for continued success and execution in 2025,\u201d said Jay Duker, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer. \u201cMost importantly, as we step into 2025, both of our global Phase 3 clinical trials for DURAVYU in wet AMD are now fully underway with enrollment in both trials exceeding our expectations. The LUGANO trial has already enrolled approximately one-third of planned patients, and the LUCIA trial is tracking ahead of schedule after an accelerated initiation in December. We expect to fully enroll these trials in the second half of 2025. We remain very excited by the large market opportunity for DURAVYU in diabetic macular edema (DME) where 16-week interim data demonstrated early and sustained improvement in BCVA and CST. We look forward to final VERONA data as well as alignment with the FDA and EMA in the coming months to finalize our Phase 3 plan for this important indication.\u201d Dr. Duker continued, \u201cWe continue our track record of strong execution with the opening of our new, state-of-the-art Northbridge, MA manufacturing facility in the fall of 2024. The 40,000 plus square-foot manufacturing facility reflects our commitment to quality and commercial readiness for DURAVYU. With two simultaneous Phase 3 clinical trials underway, the most robust clinical dataset of all long-acting treatments in development for wet AMD, an impressive patent portfolio for DURAVYU, and a strong balance sheet, we are well-positioned to advance our mission of bringing potentially life-changing therapeutics to patients suffering from serious retinal diseases globally.\u201d Story Continues The Leader in Sustained Ocular Drug Delivery : Global Phase 3 LUGANO and LUCIA pivotal trials of DURAVYU in wet AMD underway. Enrollment completion of both trials is expected in 2H 2025, with topline data anticipated in 2026. DURAVYU Phase 3 pivotal design is the only sustained delivery wet AMD program evaluating six-month re-dosing in both trials. The LUGANO and LUCIA trials are also designed to provide data on the efficacy, durability, and safety of DURAVYU and provide the retina community with valuable insight on how DURAVYU could be used in \u2018real-world\u2019 practice. DURAVYU was evaluated in the largest Phase 2 clinical trial to date (DAVIO 2) of all sustained delivery programs in development, meeting all primary and secondary endpoints. DURAVYU is the only sustained release TKI being evaluated in DME. Positive interim 16-week data from the Phase 2 VERONA clinical trial demonstrated DURAVYU 2.7mg meaningfully improved patients with active DME better than aflibercept alone both anatomically and visually with CST (central subfield thickness) improvement of 68.1 microns and a BCVA gain of +8.9 letters vs. baseline. Notably, both DURAVYU doses showed an immediate benefit demonstrating the unique drug release profile of DURAVYU. Full topline data from the Phase 2 VERONA clinical trial is expected in 1Q 2025 with interactions with the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on Phase 3 plans to follow. DURAVYU has the most robust safety database among sustained delivery treatments with over 190 patients dosed across multiple indications, with no DURAVYU related ocular or systemic serious adverse events reported. EyePoint\u2019s Durasert technology has been utilized in four FDA approved products with an established favorable safety profile in thousands of patients. Corporate Updates In January 2025, EyePoint appointed renowned retina specialist and industry pioneer Reginald J. Sanders, M.D., FASRS to the Board of Directors. In October 2024, EyePoint announced the opening of its Northbridge, MA cGMP commercial manufacturing facility built to meet U.S. FDA and EMA standards. It will support global manufacturing across the Company\u2019s portfolio, including lead pipeline asset, DURAVYU\u2122\u00a0upon potential regulatory approval. The facility is strategically designed to support the Company\u2019s next phase of growth and broadens EyePoint\u2019s manufacturing capabilities with capacity for pipeline expansion. Approximately $370 million 1 of cash and investments at December 31, 2024 with cash runway into 2027 beyond topline Phase 3 data for DURAVYU in wet AMD expected in 2026. EyePoint will present at the 43 rd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco on Tuesday, January 14, 2025 at 2:15 p.m. PT/5:15 p.m. ET. Jay S. Duker, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide a company update on clinical and regulatory progress and highlight upcoming milestones.

About DURAVYU\u2122 DURAVYU\u2122, f/k/a EYP-1901, is being developed as a potential paradigm-altering treatment for patients suffering from VEGF-mediated retinal diseases. DURAVYU delivers vorolanib, a potent, selective and patent-protected tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) as a solid bioerodible insert using EyePoint\u2019s proprietary sustained-release Durasert E\u2122\u00a0technology. Vorolanib brings a new mechanistic approach to the treatment of VEGF-mediated retinal diseases as a pan-VEGF receptor inhibitor, inhibiting all VEGF receptors. In an in-vivo model of retinal detachment, vorolanib demonstrated neuroprotection and may have antifibrotic benefits as it also blocks PDGF. DURAVYU is shipped and stored at ambient temperature and is administered with a standard intravitreal injection in the physician's office. DURAVYU is immediately bioavailable with zero-order kinetics release for at least six months. Positive data from Phase 1 and Phase 2 (DAVIO 2) clinical trials of DURAVYU in wet AMD demonstrated clinically meaningful efficacy data with stable visual acuity and CST and a favorable safety profile. Data from DAVIO 2 demonstrated an impressive treatment burden reduction of approximately 88% six months after treatment with DURAVYU, with over 80% of patients supplement-free or receiving only one supplemental anti-VEGF injection. The DAVIO 2 clinical trial data supported the initiation of the current global Phase 3 clinical trials, LUGANO and LUCIA in wet AMD. DURAVYU is also currently being studied in the Phase 2 VERONA trial for diabetic macular edema (DME) with positive interim 16-week results for both safety and efficacy. Full topline data is expected in the first quarter of 2025.

Thu, Dec 5, 2024, 3:06 PM 1 min read In This Article: EYPT -6.27% https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/mind-medicine-doses-first-patient-in-panorama-study EyePoint ( EYPT ) Pharmaceuticals announced that the first patient has been dosed in the LUCIA trial, the Company\u2019s second global Phase 3 clinical trial of DURAVYU, formerly EYP-1901, for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration. DURAVYU is an investigational sustained delivery therapy delivering patent-protected vorolanib, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor formulated in proprietary bioerodible Durasert E(TM) for sustained intraocular delivery. LUGANO and LUCIA are global, randomized, double-masked, aflibercept controlled, non-inferiority Phase 3 trials assessing the efficacy and safety of DURAVYU in patients with active wet AMD including treatment naive and treatment experienced patients. Each trial is expected to enroll approximately 400 patients globally who will be randomly assigned to a 2.7mg dose of DURAVYU or an on-label aflibercept control. The LUGANO and LUCIA trials are the only sustained release wet AMD pivotal Phase 3 trials evaluating re-dosing in both trials. Patients in the DURAVYU treatment arm will receive an intravitreal injection of DURAVYU every six months, starting at month two of the trial. DURAVYU is delivered via a standard intravitreal injection in the physician\u2019s office, similar to current standard practice with FDA approved anti-VEGF treatments. The primary endpoint of the Phase 3 pivotal trials is the average change in best corrected visual acuity at weeks 52 and 56 versus baseline. Secondary endpoints include safety, reduction in treatment burden, percentage of eyes free of supplemental aflibercept injections and anatomical results as measured by optical coherence tomography.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $15.2 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.

Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $30.56 indicates a potential upside of 175.1%. The average comprises nine short-term price targets ranging from a low of $18 to a high of $68, with a standard deviation of $15.13. While the lowest estimate indicates an increase of 62% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 512.1% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts. While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in EYPT. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside. Here's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price Targets According to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading. While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why? They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts. However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces. Story Continues That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism. Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in EYPT Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 5.5%, as three estimates have moved higher compared to no negative revision. Moreover, EYPT currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term.

Announces First Patient Dosed in Second Global Phase 3 LUCIA Clinical Trial of DURAVYU\u2122 for the Treatment of Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration EyePoint Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Wed, Dec 4, 2024, 3:00 PM 11 min read In This Article: EYPT -6.27% EyePoint Pharmaceuticals, Inc. \u2013 Topline data for Phase 3 pivotal program anticipated in 2026 \u2013 WATERTOWN, Mass., Dec. 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EyePoint Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: EYPT), a company committed to developing and commercializing innovative therapeutics to improve the lives of patients with serious retinal diseases, today announced that the first patient has been dosed in the LUCIA trial, the Company\u2019s second global Phase 3 clinical trial of DURAVYU, formerly EYP-1901, for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). DURAVYU is an investigational sustained delivery therapy delivering patent-protected vorolanib, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor formulated in proprietary bioerodible Durasert E\u2122 for sustained intraocular delivery. \u201cDosing the first patient in our second global Phase 3 clinical trial, the LUCIA trial, marks another significant milestone demonstrating our continued focus on execution at EyePoint,\u201d said Jay S. Duker, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of EyePoint. \u201cWe are encouraged by the robust physician and patient interest in DURAVYU with enrollment in our first pivotal trial, the LUGANO trial, exceeding our expectations. With two simultaneous Phase 3 clinical trials underway, the most robust clinical dataset of all long-acting treatments in development for wet AMD, and a strong balance sheet, we are well-positioned as the leader in sustained-release ocular drug delivery bringing impactful therapies to patients suffering from serious retinal diseases.\u201d \u201cWe are pleased to have dosed the first patient in the LUCIA trial so soon after dosing the first patient in the LUGANO trial. This underscores our commitment to develop innovative therapies with the potential to change the current treatment paradigm in wet AMD,\u201d said Ramiro Ribeiro, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer of EyePoint. \u201cThe Phase 3 pivotal program is the first and only sustained release wet AMD pivotal program evaluating re-dosing in both trials. Following a typical non-inferiority approval pathway, the LUGANO and LUCIA trials will provide data on the efficacy, durability, safety and dosing flexibility of treatment with DURAVYU and have the potential to provide the retina community valuable insights on how DURAVYU could be used in \u2018real-world\u2019 practice. With over 240 global sites already committed across both Phase 3 trials and exceptional patient and investigator enthusiasm, we are confident we can rapidly enroll patients in the Phase 3 pivotal trials.\u201d \u201cPatients with wet AMD typically require life-long treatment with frequent intravitreal injections to preserve their vision.\u00a0\u00a0This high treatment burden often results in under-treatment and irreversible vision loss,\u201d said Adam Gerstenblith, M.D., principal investigator in the LUCIA clinical trial and vitreoretinal surgeon at Mid Atlantic Retina Specialists. \u201cThe Phase 3 LUCIA trial is an important step forward in our pursuit of more durable treatments that are safe and effective. Moreover, the design of the LUCIA trial includes both treatment na\u00efve and previously treated wet AMD patients, as well as re-dosing of DURAVYU every six months, which aligns well with how we would approach potential treatment using DURAVYU in clinical practice. We are proud to be the site to treat a patient with DURAVYU in the LUCIA trial and we look forward to continuing to work with EyePoint to rapidly enroll patients in this critical Phase 3 program.\u201d Story Continues LUGANO and LUCIA are global, randomized, double-masked, aflibercept controlled, non-inferiority Phase 3 trials assessing the efficacy and safety of DURAVYU in patients with active wet AMD including treatment na\u00efve and treatment experienced patients. Each trial is expected to enroll approximately 400 patients globally who will be randomly assigned to a 2.7mg dose of DURAVYU or an on-label aflibercept control. The LUGANO and LUCIA trials are the only sustained release wet AMD pivotal Phase 3 trials evaluating re-dosing in both trials. Patients in the DURAVYU treatment arm will receive an intravitreal injection of DURAVYU every six months, starting at month two of the trial. DURAVYU is delivered via a standard intravitreal injection in the physician's office, similar to current standard practice with FDA approved anti-VEGF treatments. The primary endpoint of the Phase 3 pivotal trials is the average change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at weeks 52 and 56 versus baseline. Secondary endpoints include safety, reduction in treatment burden, percentage of eyes free of supplemental aflibercept injections and anatomical results as measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). More information about the trial is available at clinicaltrials.gov (LUGANO identifier: NCT06668064; LUCIA identifier: NCT06683742). About Wet AMD Wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss and irreversible blindness in people over the age of 50. Wet AMD is an advanced form of condition that develops when abnormal blood vessels grow into the macular retina, leaking blood or fluid, and leading to potentially severe vision loss. Wet AMD is a lifelong disease that requires continuous treatment so that patients may maintain visual function. Although multiple treatments are now available, challenges still exist as the current standard-of-care is dosed on average every two months in\u00a0the United States\u00a0under a treat-and-extend protocol, and these large molecule anti-VEGF treatments only target one pathology of the disease. This lifetime of frequent treatment represents a tremendous burden for patients, physicians, and the health care system, potentially leading to patient noncompliance and further vision loss. About DURAVYU \u2122 DURAVYU TM , f/k/a EYP-1901, is being developed as a potential paradigm-altering treatment for patients suffering from VEGF-mediated retinal diseases. DURAVYU delivers vorolanib, a potent, selective and patent-protected tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) as a solid bioerodible insert using EyePoint\u2019s proprietary sustained-release Durasert E \u2122 technology. Vorolanib brings a new mechanistic approach to the treatment of VEGF-mediated retinal diseases as a pan-VEGF receptor inhibitor, inhibiting all VEGF receptors. Further, in an in-vivo model of retinal detachment, vorolanib demonstrated neuroprotection and may have antifibrotic benefits as it also blocks PDGF. DURAVYU is shipped and stored at ambient temperature and is administered with a standard intravitreal injection in the physician's office. DURAVYU is immediately bioavailable with zero-order kinetics release for at least six months. Positive data from both the Phase 1 DAVIO and Phase 2 DAVIO 2 clinical trials of DURAVYU in wet AMD demonstrated clinically meaningful efficacy data with stable visual acuity and CST and a favorable safety profile. Further, data from DAVIO 2 demonstrated an impressive treatment burden reduction of approximately 88% at eight months, six months after treatment with DURAVYU, with over 80% of patients supplement-free or receiving only one supplemental anti-VEGF injection through up to eight months, six months after treatment with DURAVYU. The data from the DAVIO 2 clinical trial supported the advancement of the wet AMD program and the initiation of the global Phase 3 clinical trials, LUGANO and LUCIA. DURAVYU is also currently being studied in the Phase 2 VERONA trial for diabetic macular edema (DME). Full topline data is expected in the first quarter of 2025. About EyePoint Pharmaceuticals EyePoint (Nasdaq: EYPT) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing and commercializing innovative therapeutics to help improve the lives of patients with serious retinal diseases. The Company's pipeline leverages its proprietary bioerodible Durasert E \u2122 technology for sustained intraocular drug delivery. The Company\u2019s lead product candidate, DURAVYU \u2122 (f/k/a EYP-1901), is an investigational sustained delivery treatment for VEGF-mediated retinal diseases combining vorolanib, a selective and patent-protected tyrosine kinase inhibitor with bioerodible Durasert E \u2122 . DURAVYU is presently in Phase 3 global, pivotal clinical trials as a sustained delivery treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), the leading cause of vision loss among people 50 years of age and older in\u00a0the United States, and in a Phase 2 clinical trial in diabetic macular edema (DME). EyePoint expects full topline data from the Phase 2 clinical trial in DME in Q1 2025 and topline data from both Phase 3 pivotal trials in wet AMD in 2026. Pipeline programs include EYP-2301, a TIE-2 agonist, razuprotafib, formulated in Durasert E \u2122 to potentially improve outcomes in serious retinal diseases. The proven Durasert \u00ae drug delivery technology has been safely administered to thousands of patient eyes across four\u00a0U.S.\u00a0FDA approved products.\u00a0EyePoint Pharmaceuticals\u00a0is headquartered in\u00a0Watertown, Massachusetts. Vorolanib is licensed to EyePoint exclusively by Equinox Sciences, a Betta Pharmaceuticals affiliate, for the localized treatment of all ophthalmic diseases outside of\u00a0China,\u00a0Macao,\u00a0Hong Kong\u00a0and\u00a0Taiwan. DURAVYU\u2122 has been conditionally accepted by the FDA as the proprietary name for EYP-1901. DURAVYU is an investigational product; it has not been approved by the FDA. FDA approval and the timeline for potential approval is uncertain.
