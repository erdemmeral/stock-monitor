[{"text": "LIVE The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs AAON (NASDAQ:AAON) jumps 5.4% this week, though earnings growth is still tracking behind five-year shareholder returns editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 1:21 PM 3 min read In This Article: AAON -1.39% When you buy a stock there is always a possibility that it could drop 100%. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For instance, the price of AAON, Inc. ( NASDAQ:AAON ) stock is up an impressive 283% over the last five years. On top of that, the share price is up 29% in about a quarter. Since the stock has added US$569m to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns. View our latest analysis for AAON While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time. Over half a decade, AAON managed to grow its earnings per share at 30% a year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 31%. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth. You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). NasdaqGS:AAON Earnings Per Share Growth January 23rd 2025 It's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of AAON's earnings, revenue and cash flow . What About Dividends? When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return . The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, AAON's TSR for the last 5 years was 294%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments! A Different Perspective It's good to see that AAON has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 97% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 32% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the 1 warning sign we've spotted with AAON . Story Continues But note: AAON may not be the best stock to buy .

quarter\u2019s best and worst performers in the hvac and water systems industry, including Advanced Drainage (NYSE:WMS) and its peers.

Continued choppiness in the non-residential end market impacted revenue from both pipe and allied products which, combined with significant storm events, resulted in revenue flat to the prior year. Importantly, we were able to manage through demand fluctuations and unfavorable price/cost to maintain a robust Adjusted EBITDA margin of 31.4%, underscoring the resiliency of the ADS business model. \" Advanced Drainage Total Revenue Unsurprisingly, the stock is down 22.3% since reporting and currently trades at $123.50.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our 9 Best Market-Beating Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

tariffs Comfort Systems Stock Surges 84% in 6 Months: What's Next for FIX? Shrabana Mukherjee Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 7:13 PM 5 min read In This Article: FIX -1.66% Comfort Systems USA FIX, a leading provider of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) services, has seen its stock skyrocket 83.5% over the past six months. This impressive performance outshines the Zacks Building Products - Air Conditioner and Heating industry\u2019s 22.1% gain, the broader construction sector\u2019s 6% increase, and even the S&P 500\u2019s 12.1% rise. The FIX stock has also outperformed its peer group companies, AAON, Inc. AAON, EMCOR Group, Inc. EME and Watsco, Inc. WSO. AAON, EME and WSO shares have surged 61.6%, 50.3% and 5.3%, respectively, over the past six months. Comfort Systems Stock 6-Month Share Performance Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The company\u2019s growth is fueled by strong market demand, a robust project pipeline, and continued innovation. With FIX consistently trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, technical indicators suggest that investor confidence remains high, as shown below. But does this rally have more room to run, or should investors consider locking in profits? Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Comfort Systems\u2019 Growth Drivers: Demand, Backlog, and Sector Strength Comfort Systems has benefited from strong demand across various end markets, particularly in technology and manufacturing. The company reported a record backlog of $5.7 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024, a 32.4% year-over-year jump. This backlog underscores the ongoing demand for its services and management\u2019s disciplined approach to project selection, focusing on high-margin, low-risk opportunities. Sectoral diversity plays a key role in FIX\u2019s resilience. Industrial clients, including those in technology, life sciences, and battery production, accounted for 60% of revenues in the third quarter of 2024. Institutional markets, including education and healthcare, provided stability, while service revenues climbed 7%, positioning the company to surpass $1 billion in service revenues this year. Market Trends of FIX: AI, Semiconductor Growth, and Sustainability The surge in data center construction, driven by AI and hyperscale computing needs, has created a strong tailwind for Comfort Systems. Demand for advanced cooling systems and dense copper installations continues to rise. Additionally, the CHIPS Act and reshoring efforts in the United States have increased semiconductor manufacturing projects, further boosting the company\u2019s pipeline. Comfort Systems is also well-positioned to benefit from the push for energy-efficient buildings and renewable technologies. With a strong foothold in modular and industrial construction, the company is capitalizing on growing sustainability trends in commercial and institutional sectors. Story Continues Comfort Systems\u2019 Operational Strength: Innovation and Execution A key differentiator for FIX is its ability to integrate advanced construction technologies. The early adoption of Building Information Modeling has enhanced its prefabrication and modular construction capabilities, leading to improved project execution. By leveraging mobile technology and data analytics, the company is driving efficiencies in service and construction operations. Partnerships with tech firms and pilot programs exploring emerging technologies ensure that Comfort Systems remains at the forefront of industry innovation. These strategic initiatives are helping the company maintain competitive advantages in a rapidly evolving construction landscape. FIX\u2019s Financial Resilience: Strong Balance Sheet and Cash Flow FIX\u2019s financials remain solid, with revenues of $5.16 billion and a gross profit of $1.04 billion in the first nine months of 2024. The company has generated positive free cash flow for 25 consecutive years, reinforcing its strong liquidity position. As of Sept. 30, 2024, Comfort Systems held $415.6 million in cash against a minimal debt of $68.4 million, resulting in a low debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.09. This strong financial foundation has enabled the company to increase dividends and execute share repurchases. FIX has steadily raised its dividend payout for 12 consecutive years, currently offering an annual dividend of $1.40 per share with a low payout ratio of 9%. FIX\u2019s Challenges: Managing Demand and Workforce Constraints Despite its impressive performance, FIX faces challenges in balancing its backlog with disciplined project selection. The company remains selective in securing new contracts to ensure profitability and execution efficiency. CEO Brian Lane has emphasized that the challenge isn\u2019t finding work but maintaining disciplined selection to optimize margins. Another hurdle is workforce allocation. With increased project demand, maintaining a skilled labor force remains a priority. FIX has invested in automation and modular construction to improve efficiency, particularly in its Houston and North Carolina operations, but workforce constraints remain a key operational risk. FIX Stock Valuation While FIX\u2019s growth is impressive, its valuation has climbed significantly. The stock currently trades at a forward 12-month earnings multiple of 32.51x, marking the high end of its five-year range (8.59x to 32.51x). This suggests that much of the optimism surrounding FIX\u2019s growth prospects may already be priced in. FIX\u2019s P/E Ratio (Forward 12-Month) vs. Industry Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Additionally, earnings estimate revisions have remained muted over the past 60 days, indicating cautious sentiment among analysts. However, 2025 earnings per share projections still point to a 20.8% year-over-year increase, suggesting continued profitability.

Revenues are expected to be $1.75 billion, up 29.3% from the year-ago quarter.

-0.73% We recently published a list of 10 Jim Cramer Stocks to Watch in 2025 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Dover Corporation (NYSE:DOV) stands against other Jim Cramer stocks to watch in 2025. Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC commented on the bearish start of 2025 and said being a bear in the market is \u201ceasy\u201d because when the stocks rise no one would remember your outlook but if they fall, you will get the credit for your forethought. Cramer mentioned the reasons why he is bullish on the market in 2025. First, Cramer believes the departure of FTC Chair Lina Khan would bode well for the market. He called Khan \u201cway over her head\u201d and said she used to oppose \u201call deals.\u201d Cramer also said President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies are expected to be \u201cnegotiable\u201d that would offset their negative impact on companies. He also commented on the expected dynamics in the housing market: \u201cHousing breaks price we\u2019re already seeing what happens when there\u2019s overbuilding as is case in Florida. Prices come down when mortgage rates go up. What happens? Prices go down. Once prices come down, you know what? Buyers start staying away hoping for still lower prices, and it usually works, causing sellers to panic furiously, cutting prices themselves. They\u2019ll be stuck and can\u2019t move. It\u2019s called the cycle. Although it has been operating normally for the last few years, I think 2025 will be the year the cycle reasserts itself, and the FED will win big on this one.\u201d READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article we picked 10 stocks Jim Cramer was talking about heading into the new year.

Dover Corporation (NYSE: DOV ) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 32 In late October, a caller asked Jim Cramer about his thoughts on HVAC company Aaon Inc (NASDAQ:AAON).

RPM reported impressive second-quarter fiscal 2025 (ended Nov. 30, 2024) results with earnings and sales beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Both metrics increased on a year-over-year basis. Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar. This specialty chemicals manufacturer\u2019s shares gained 1.1% yesterday, after it reported strong earnings on the back of record adjusted EBIT for the 12th consecutive quarter and reduced interest expenses. The bottom line improved on the continued implementation of MAP 2025 operational improvement initiatives. Efforts to streamline SG&A expenses supported this progress. The company also achieved a record adjusted EBIT margin and maintained strong operating cash flow. Inside the Headlines RPM\u2019s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.39 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.35 by 3% and increased 13.9% from the year-ago period. This upside was driven by reduced interest expenses from debt paydowns of $226.5 million in the last 12 months. Net sales of $1.85 billion surpassed the consensus mark of $1.78 billion by 3.7% and increased 3% from the prior year\u2019s $1.79 billion. This growth was driven by higher volumes across all four segments. The company focused on repair and maintenance while pursuing targeted organic growth opportunities. Strong performance was noted in technical solutions for high-performance construction, while residential markets showed signs of stabilization, supported by favorable weather conditions. RPM International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise RPM International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise RPM International Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | RPM International Inc. Quote Geographically, sales increased 4.2% in North America (accounting for around 77% of total sales). Sales in Europe (15% of total sales) increased 1.2%, driven by MAP 2025 initiatives. The metric in Africa and the Middle East (2% of total sales) grew 11.6%, aided by spending on high-performance construction projects. However, Latin America (4% of total sales) was down 9.5% year over year due to foreign currency headwinds. Asia Pacific (2% of total sales) also declined 5.3%, due to challenging year-over-year comparison. Net sales grew 3.7% organically. However, divestitures, net of acquisitions, reduced sales by 0.1% and foreign currency translation impacted sales by 0.6%. RPM\u2019s Operational Discussion Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 28.7% from 29.2% reported a year ago. Adjusted EBIT increased 7.7% year over year to $255.1 million. Adjusted EBIT margin improved 60 basis points (bps) year over year to 13.8%. Story Continues Segmental Details of RPM Construction Products Group (CPG): In the reported quarter, segment sales increased 4.3% from a year ago to $690.1 million, owing to 4.9% organic growth and 0.1% contribution from buyouts. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 0.7%. CPG achieved strong sales, driven by turnkey roofing systems, restoration efforts, a direct sales model and exceptional customer service. Adjusted EBIT of $108.6 million was up 9% year over year and adjusted EBIT margin rose 60 bps to 15.7%. This was driven by sales growth and MAP 2025, partially offset by an unfavorable mix. Performance Coatings Group (PCG): The segment\u2019s sales increased 1.4% year over year to $374.9 million. Sales were up 3.3% organically but declined 1.1% due to divestitures, net of acquisitions and 0.8% owing to currency headwinds. PCG\u2019s organic sales improvement was led by the flooring and protective coatings businesses, which benefited from its focus on high-performance construction projects. Adjusted EBIT rose 6.7% on a year-over-year basis to $65 million and adjusted EBIT margin expanded 90 bps to 17.1%. MAP 2025 benefits and sales growth aided the bottom line. Consumer Group: Sales in the segment increased 2% year over year to $590.2 million, driven by market share gains and stabilization in DIY takeaway, supported by favorable weather conditions. Successful targeted marketing campaigns drove strong growth in international markets. Organic sales increased 2.7%, while unfavorable foreign currency translation impacted sales by 0.7%. The segment\u2019s adjusted EBIT increased 0.3% from the prior year\u2019s level to $96.6 million but the adjusted EBIT margin contracted 30 bps to 16.4%. Adjusted EBIT increased on the back of MAP 2025 benefits, sales growth and the rationalization of lower-margin products. Specialty Products Group (SPG): The segment\u2019s sales totaled $184.9 million, which increased 4.4% on a year-over-year basis (up 2.4% organically). This upside was driven by the disaster recovery business and its response to hurricanes. The acquisition contributed 1.5% to sales growth. Adjusted EBIT for the quarter totaled $19.6 million, up 16% from the prior-year level, while the adjusted EBIT margin grew 100 bps to 10.6%. Adjusted EBIT growth was backed by MAP 2025 benefits and improved sales.

"LIVE The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs Copeland Partners with HVAC Leaders to Deliver Advanced Cold-Climate Heat Pump Technologies Business Wire Tue, Jan 7, 2025, 5:00 PM 3 min read Collaborations underscore Copeland\u2019s leadership in the electrification of heating systems as OEMs participate in the Department of Energy's Cold-Climate Heat Pump Technology Challenges ST. LOUIS, January 07, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Copeland, a global leader in sustainable heating, cooling, refrigeration and industrial solutions, announced that AAON, a leader in high-performance and energy-efficient HVAC solutions, and several other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have recently selected Copeland to help advance their standard and cold-climate heat pump solutions. These strategic OEM partnerships follow the issuance of the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Residential and Commercial Building Cold-Climate Heat Pump (CCHP) Technology Challenges. Heat pumps cut greenhouse gas emissions by replacing or supplementing fossil fuel heating with efficient, low-carbon systems that work year-round and integrate with renewables. Traditionally, they were less effective in cold climates, needing backup heat at low temperatures. The DOE Residential Cold Climate Heat Pump Challenge aims to develop high-efficiency heat pumps that perform at temperatures as low as -15 F, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional heating. Similarly, the DOE\u2019s Commercial Building Heat Pump Technology Challenge seeks to create emissions-effective heat pump rooftop units to help organizations meet energy efficiency and decarbonization goals. \"Our partnership with Copeland will help us meet the rigorous standards of the DOE\u2019s Commercial Building Heat Pump Technology Challenge,\" said Brent Stockton, director of engineering at AAON. \"Copeland\u2019s commitment to research and development and their innovative technologies are essential in helping us deliver solutions that meet and exceed performance expectations in the most challenging environments.\" These recent OEM partnerships highlight Copeland\u2019s pivotal role in advancing cutting-edge heat pump technologies designed to perform efficiently in colder climates. The collaborations further underscore Copeland\u2019s leadership in the electrification of heating systems and a commitment to supporting OEMs in delivering high-efficiency, sustainable heating solutions. \"As the U.S. shifts toward cleaner, more sustainable energy sources, AAON is tackling the challenge head-on, developing more resilient and efficient cold-climate heat pump solutions,\" said Mark Bills, vice president and general manager of commercial HVAC at Copeland. \"Our engineering expertise and advanced heat pump technologies are designed to help our OEM partners achieve rigorous performance standards and facilitate greater adoption of these new technologies.\" Story continues Two DOE grants awarded to Copeland in 2024 further fuel these activities and the company\u2019s ability to advance the research and manufacturing of cold-climate heat pump technologies. One grant funds research and development for modular heat pump technology with integrated thermal energy storage, while the other grant expands Copeland\u2019s production capacity for heat pump compressors across key U.S. manufacturing facilities. These investments in facilities in Ava and Lebanon, Missouri, Sidney, Ohio, and Cudahy, Wisconsin, further enable Copeland to meet the growing demand for high-efficiency, cold-climate heat pumps across residential, commercial and industrial markets.
