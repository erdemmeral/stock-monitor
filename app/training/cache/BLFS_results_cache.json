[{"text": "Strong Segmental Performance to Drive Stryker's Q4 Earnings? Zacks Equity Research Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 8:33 PM 5 min read In This Article: SYK -0.04% Stryker Corporation SYK is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2024 results on Jan. 28, after market close. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 3.24%. Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar. Q4 Estimates The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $3.87 per share, indicating an increase of 11.9% year over year. The consensus mark for revenues is pinned at $6.35 billion, implying growth of 9.2% from the prior-year reported figure. Factors to Note Stryker\u2019s fourth-quarter performance is likely to have been driven by strong performance in the U.S. market, notably in Instruments, Medical, Endoscopy, Trauma and Extremities and Mako. Strong International sales also buoy optimism, which is likely to have accelerated in the to-be-reported quarter. The company's MedSurg and Neurotechnology segment witnessed substantial sales growth in the third quarter on the back of increased unit volume and higher prices. Strong performances in the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Japan and most emerging markets also boosted revenues. This trend is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter. Stryker is also poised for significant growth, having had several launches in the past few months. In November, it launched two new products \u2014 the next generation of SurgiCount+ and the Oculan Lighting Platform. These two products are likely to have generated additional sales during the fourth quarter. On its third-quarter earnings call, SYK stated that its commercialization of the Pangea Plating system is progressing well. Its LIFEPAK 35 defibrillator and monitor witnessed a strong order book, and sales have started to ramp up. The trend is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter as well. The Osteotomy Truss System and the Ankle Truss System, launched in September, are likely to have boosted SYK\u2019s Foot & Ankle portfolio with enhanced surgical precision and improved patient outcomes. Meanwhile, enhanced surgical precision and patient safety with the use of Spine Guidance 5 Software featuring Copilot might have driven adoption higher during the fourth quarter. Apart from the launches, SYK is also strengthening its product portfolio with acquisitions. The company completed five acquisitions during the second half of 2024, including Vertos Medical in October, Care.ai and NICO Corporation in September, MOLLI Surgical in August, and Artelon in July. Vertos Medical and NICO added minimally invasive solutions for pain and hemorrhage procedures, respectively. While Care.ai strengthened its healthcare and IT offerings, Artelon added soft tissue fixation products and MOLLI\u2019s portfolio boosted Stryker\u2019s surgical solutions in breast cancer care. These acquisitions are likely to be accretive to the quarterly results. On its fourth-quarter earnings call, the company will likely provide updates related to the integration of these recently acquired businesses and their future impact on its performance. Story Continues Our estimate for the MedSurg and Neurotechnology, and the Orthopaedics & Spine segments\u2019 sales is pegged at $3.75 billion and $2.57 billion, respectively. U.S. and international sales are estimated to be $4.74 billion and $1.59 billion, respectively. Meanwhile, the ongoing pressure in China due to volume-based procurement policy might have partially offset international growth. Stryker is working toward alleviating the ongoing inflationary pressure. It continued to recognize improved pricing and reduced cost pressure in the past couple of quarters. This is likely to have benefited gross margin during the fourth quarter. What the Zacks Model Unveils Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Stryker this time around.

(BLFS) Is a Great Choice for 'Trend' Investors, Here's Why Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 4:50 PM 3 min read In This Article: BLFS -2.51% Most of us have heard the dictum \"the trend is your friend.\" And this is undeniably the key to success when it comes to short-term investing or trading. But it isn't easy to ensure the sustainability of a trend and profit from it. Often, the direction of a stock's price movement reverses quickly after taking a position in it, making investors incur a short-term capital loss. So, it's important to ensure that there are enough factors -- such as sound fundamentals, positive earnings estimate revisions, etc. -- that could keep the momentum in the stock going. Our \"Recent Price Strength\" screen, which is created on a unique short-term trading strategy, could be pretty useful in this regard. This predefined screen makes it really easy to shortlist the stocks that have enough fundamental strength to maintain their recent uptrend. Also, the screen passes only the stocks that are trading in the upper portion of their 52-week high-low range, which is usually an indicator of bullishness. BioLife Solutions, Inc. (BLFS) is one of the several suitable candidates that passed through the screen. Here are the key reasons why it could be a profitable bet for \"trend\" investors. A solid price increase over a period of 12 weeks reflects investors' continued willingness to pay more for the potential upside in a stock. BLFS is quite a good fit in this regard, gaining 16.5% over this period. However, it's not enough to look at the price change for around three months, as it doesn't reflect any trend reversal that might have happened in a shorter time frame. It's important for a potential winner to maintain the price trend. A price increase of 3.7% over the past four weeks ensures that the trend is still in place for the stock of this company. Moreover, BLFS is currently trading at 90.3% of its 52-week High-Low Range, hinting that it can be on the verge of a breakout. Looking at the fundamentals, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises -- the key factors that impact a stock's near-term price movements. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> Story Continues Another factor that confirms the company's fundamental strength is its Average Broker Recommendation of #1 (Strong Buy). This indicates that the brokerage community is highly optimistic about the stock's near-term price performance. So, the price trend in BLFS may not reverse anytime soon. In addition to BLFS, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our \"Recent Price Strength\" screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria. This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.

(NASDAQ:BLFS) Potentially Undervalued? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Fri, Jan 10, 2025, 1:22 PM 3 min read In This Article: BLFS -2.51% BioLife Solutions, Inc. ( NASDAQ:BLFS ), might not be a large cap stock, but it saw a significant share price rise of 35% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQCM. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. As a stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s examine BioLife Solutions\u2019s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there\u2019s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for BioLife Solutions What Is BioLife Solutions Worth? Good news, investors! BioLife Solutions is still a bargain right now. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $42.47, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low.

NasdaqCM:BLFS Earnings and Revenue Growth January 10th 2025 Future outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price.

Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:BLFS) Just Reported And Analysts Have Been Cutting Their Estimates editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Fri, Nov 15, 2024, 1:31 PM 3 min read In This Article: BLFS -2.51% BioLife Solutions, Inc. ( NASDAQ:BLFS ) just released its third-quarter report and things are looking bullish. The results were impressive, with revenues of US$31m exceeding analyst forecasts by 20%, and statutory losses of US$0.04 were likewise much smaller than the analysts had forecast. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year. See our latest analysis for BioLife Solutions NasdaqCM:BLFS Earnings and Revenue Growth November 15th 2024 Taking into account the latest results, the nine analysts covering BioLife Solutions provided consensus estimates of US$101.9m revenue in 2025, which would reflect a concerning 31% decline over the past 12 months. The loss per share is expected to greatly reduce in the near future, narrowing 76% to US$0.26. Before this earnings announcement, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$119.3m and losses of US$0.26 per share in 2025. So there's definitely been a change in sentiment in this update, with the analysts administering a substantial haircut to next year's revenue estimates, while at the same time holding losses per share steady. The consensus price target was broadly unchanged at US$29.30, implying that the business is performing roughly in line with expectations, despite a downwards adjustment to forecast revenue next year. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. Currently, the most bullish analyst values BioLife Solutions at US$32.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$26.00. This is a very narrow spread of estimates, implying either that BioLife Solutions is an easy company to value, or - more likely - the analysts are relying heavily on some key assumptions. Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry . These estimates imply that revenue is expected to slow, with a forecast annualised decline of 25% by the end of 2025. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 29% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the same industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 6.5% annually for the foreseeable future. It's pretty clear that BioLife Solutions' revenues are expected to perform substantially worse than the wider industry. Story Continues The Bottom Line The most important thing to take away is that the analysts reconfirmed their loss per share estimates for next year. Unfortunately, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and our data indicates underperformance compared to the wider industry. Even so, earnings per share are more important to the intrinsic value of the business. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates. With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on BioLife Solutions. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits.

Negative Points The company reported a GAAP operating loss of $1.6 million for Q3 2024, although this was an improvement from the previous year. Despite the sale of the biostorage business, BioLife Solutions Inc ( NASDAQ:BLFS ) still faces challenges with its freezer business, which is considered a drag on long-term margins. The company's total revenue guidance for 2024 was slightly reduced due to a decrease in expected storage revenue following the sale of the biostorage business. BioLife Solutions Inc ( NASDAQ:BLFS ) is still in the process of exiting its remaining freezer business, which represents less than 13% of sales but impacts long-term profitability. The company faces potential risks from macroeconomic factors and industry-wide issues that could affect future demand and growth. Q & A Highlights Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with BLFS. Q : Can you frame up what pro forma gross margins look like post the sale of SSAE, and how should we think about any OpEx savings and depreciation going forward? A : We issued an 8-K earlier today that lays out all the details for different prior periods. For the six months of 2024, adjusted gross margin sans SSAE was 60% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 13%. Going forward, we expect minimal impact on our adjusted EBITDA profile. Q : With the destocking, we've seen some swings in revenue and growth over the last year. Can you frame up how we should think about long-term growth from here? A : We expect growth in 2025 and believe the destocking is behind us. We will provide formal guidance in early January. Q : Post SSAE sale, what are the areas of focus, whether it be additional deals or capacity ads around the media business? A : The focus is on our cell processing product line, including biopreservation media and Sexton tools. We have capacity needs for biopreservation, and the sale of SSAE provides capital for this. Any M&A will focus on maintaining or expanding our market leadership in cell processing tools without negatively impacting our margin expansion trajectory. Lire la suite Q : Can you expand on the specific levers within the cell processing platform that you can pull heading into next year? A : Key factors include deepening relationships with distributors, pricing opportunities, and cross-selling Sexton tool products into our existing customer base. We expect some revenue from these initiatives toward the end of next year. Q : Regarding the announced divestiture of SSAE, does this change your strategy on the potential divestiture of CBS? A : We are committed to exiting the CBS business through a transaction and are close to completing it. The focus will remain on proprietary, higher growth, higher margin recurring revenue products in the cell processing platform.
