Story Continues About Hepion Pharmaceuticals Hepion\u2019s primary asset, Rencofilstat, is a potent inhibitor of cyclophilins, which are involved in many disease processes. Rencofilstat has been shown to reduce liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma tumor burden in experimental disease models. In November 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) granted Fast Track designation for rencofilstat for the treatment of NASH. That was followed in June 2022 by the FDA\u2019s granting of Orphan Drug designation to rencofilstat for the treatment of HCC. In April 2024, Hepion announced that it was winding down its ASCEND-NASH clinical trial. This trial was designed as a Phase 2b, randomized, multi-center, double-blinded study with first patient screened in August 2022, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Rencofilstat dosed for 12 months, with a target enrollment of 336 subjects. Enrollment was paused in April 2023, with 151 subjects randomized. To date, approximately 80 subjects have completed their Day 365 visits and are evaluable for both safety and efficacy. An additional 40 subjects will provide significant safety data for evaluation. These patients will be added to Hepion\u2019s existing safety database.

8:00 PM 2 min read Manufacturer sees increased demand for education, information and helpful products, from families seeking medical-grade protection against the effects of smoke and ash BUFFALO, N.Y. , Jan. 22, 2025 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0As Californians begin to return home after the devastating wildfires in Los Angeles and the surrounding areas, Austin Air Systems , North America's leader in clinically tested HEPA and carbon air purification technologies, is helping residents navigate the challenges of indoor air quality safety in the aftermath. \"The air after a wildfire isn't just smoke\u2014it's filled with invisible toxins that can pose serious health risks,\" said Lauren McMillan , President of Austin Air Systems. \"Air quality indexes can often be misleading as they only measure particulates, not the harmful chemicals still in the air. Those pollutants can travel for miles with a small gust of wind, making it more than just an environmental issue but a severe public health risk for California and neighboring states.\" Wildfire smoke contains a dangerous mix of chemicals, gases, metals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and fine particulate matter that can affect the heart, brain, respiratory system, and immunity\u2014especially among\u00a0children, the elderly, pregnant women, and individuals with pre-existing respiratory conditions. Web searches for \"air purifier for wildfire smoke\" have increased by more than 5,000 percent since the fires broke out, according to Google Trends and the Los Angeles Times . Austin Air has also experienced a surge in demand for its medical-grade air purifiers, and inquiries from residents asking how they can best protect their families once they return home. Austin Air Systems has a few tips for those cleared to return: Stay indoors. Close windows and limit overall outdoor exposure. Wear a mask when outside. N95 or P100 respirator masks are the most effective. Change your HVAC filter. Wildfire conditions accelerate filter degradation; replace filters regularly. Upgrade to carbon. Invest in HEPA-certified air purifiers with activated carbon filters to ensure the device is best equipped to handle the toxic air. Avoid ozone generators: These devices can worsen air toxicity, and DIY purifiers often lack proper filtration. Follow evacuation orders: Air quality can change rapidly with wind and fire flare-ups. Stay vigilant. Seek medical attention if necessary. Symptoms like coughing, breathing difficulty, or chest pain require immediate care.

Concern for Food Safety Forbes Report Camfil Air Filters Los Angeles Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 4:57 PM 4 min read Camfil USA, a leading air filtration company, supports Los Angeles communities during wildfires by providing HEPA and high MERV-A-rated filters to combat harmful smoke, gases, and odors effectively. How Los Angeles Wildfire Air Quality Impacts Food Safety: Mark Davidson of Camfil Mentioned in Forbes Wildfire Air Filtration Experts from Camfil Support Los Angeles Communities Amid Devastating Wildfires Los Angeles, CA, Jan. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As the devastating wildfires in Los Angeles continue to raise alarm over air quality, a new Forbes article sheds light on the critical connection between wildfire smoke and food safety. The article prominently features Mark Davidson , a leading expert from Camfil , who provides actionable insights on how advanced air filtration technology can mitigate these risks. Los Angeles Wildfires: A Growing Concern for Food Safety Wildfires in Los Angeles are not just an environmental concern; they also pose significant risks to public health and food production. Smoke from wildfires contains two individual hazards: ultrafine particles (PM2.5) and a wide range of unusual harmful chemicals created when buildings burn. Both can infiltrate food production facilities, threatening food safety at every stage of the supply chain. In the recent Forbes feature titled \u201c Los Angeles Wildfire Air Quality Threatens Food Safety \u201d , Davidson emphasized the urgency of addressing air quality issues to protect both food producers and consumers. \u201cWildfire smoke doesn\u2019t just linger outside; it penetrates indoor environments, impacting food safety protocols and air quality control measures,\u201d Davidson explained in the article. Camfil\u2019s Expertise: Protecting Food and Air Quality Amid Wildfires With decades of experience in air filtration, Camfil is at the forefront of addressing air quality challenges during wildfire seasons. In the Forbes article, Davidson highlighted the role of two types of filtration solutions: high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters for mitigating the risks posed by ultrafine particles, and molecular air filters to control the gaseous chemicals also found in wildfire smoke. \u201cCamfil\u2019s advanced filtration solutions are designed to capture both the smallest particulate matter and to adsorb hazardous chemicals, ensuring clean air in food production environments,\u201d Davidson noted. \u201cThis not only protects the integrity of food products but also safeguards the health of workers.\u201d Real-World Data: How Wildfires Impact California\u2019s Food Industry The Forbes feature also delves into how recent wildfires have impacted California\u2019s food producers. In 2023 alone, contamination risks during peak wildfire season rose by over 30%, leading to costly recalls and disruptions in supply chains. Story continues Camfil stepped in to provide tailored filtration solutions to several affected facilities, preventing airborne contaminants from compromising food safety. This proactive approach reduced risks, allowing businesses to maintain operations even during the most severe wildfire conditions. Mark Davidson\u2019s Recommendations for Food Producers In the Forbes piece, Davidson outlined essential steps for food producers to mitigate the impact of wildfire smoke: Upgrade Air Filters: Install HEPA filters when compatible with the HVAC system. Otherwise, install the highest MERV-A-rated filter that maintains the required airflow. Install molecular filters to help control odor and to remove invisible gases and harmful chemicals. Conduct Air Quality Assessments : Regularly monitor indoor air quality to ensure compliance with safety standards and each facility's individual Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) plan. Proactive Maintenance : Service HVAC and filtration systems ahead of wildfire season to ensure peak performance. Collaborative Solutions for a Safer Future Davidson and the team at Camfil are committed to helping food producers adapt to the challenges posed by climate change and wildfires. \u201cBy implementing advanced air filtration solutions, we can protect food safety and public health even in the face of extreme environmental events,\u201d Davidson emphasized in the Forbes article.

Buildings Toronto, ON, Jan. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Camfil Canada, a global leader in clean air solutions, has released a comprehensive blog titled How to Improve Airflow and Circulation in a Building that explores the vital role of airflow and air circulation in maintaining healthy indoor environments. From workplaces to commercial and public spaces, ensuring proper airflow is essential for improving air quality and creating a healthier, more comfortable environment for building occupants. The Importance of Airflow and Circulation Proper airflow and circulation play a pivotal role in removing indoor pollutants, reducing allergens, and regulating temperature and humidity. Without adequate circulation, harmful particulates such as PM2.5, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and mould can accumulate, posing significant health risks. Camfil's blog outlines how high-quality air filtration systems and optimized HVAC performance can address these challenges effectively. Key Benefits of Optimized Airflow and Circulation: Improved Air Quality: Efficient ventilation systems dilute and remove airborne pollutants. Enhanced Comfort: Consistent airflow ensures even temperature distribution across building spaces. Energy Efficiency: Proper circulation reduces strain on HVAC systems, saving energy. Healthier Environments: Cleaner air minimizes the risks of asthma, allergies, and cardiovascular issues. Practical Solutions for Better Airflow Camfil's experts recommend implementing solutions such as: Installing high-efficiency air filters (MERV 13-A or HEPA filters) to capture contaminants. Maintaining HVAC systems through regular cleaning and monitoring. Utilizing both mechanical and natural ventilation when possible. Retrofitting older buildings with advanced filtration systems. Why Air Changes Per Hour (ACH) Matter Air changes per hour (ACH) ensure the effective dilution of harmful particles in indoor spaces. Organizations like ASHRAE and the CSA recommend ACH standards tailored to building types, from residential properties to hospitals, to maintain optimal air quality.
