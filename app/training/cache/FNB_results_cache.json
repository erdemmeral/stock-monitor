Corp Q4 Earnings Beat on Higher NII & Fee Income, Stock Dips Zacks Equity Research Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 3:50 PM 4 min read In This Article: FNB -2.49% F.N.B. Corporation \u2019s FNB fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 38 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 33 cents. Moreover, the bottom line was flat with the prior-year quarter\u2019s level. Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar. Results were aided by growth in net interest income (NII) and non-interest income. Also, higher loans and deposits are other positives. However, higher provisions and adjusted expenses were the undermining factors. Shares of FNB lost 2.3% in Wednesday\u2019s trading session in light of these negatives. After considering significant items, the net income available to its common stockholders was $109.9 million, up from $50.8 million year over year. Our estimate for the metric was $114.7 million. For 2024, adjusted earnings were $1.39 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.34. However, the bottom line declined 11.5% from 2023. The net income available to its common stockholders (GAAP) was $459.3 million, down 3.7% from the previous year. FNB\u2019s Revenues Improve, Expenses Rise Quarterly net revenues were $373.1 million, up 10.7% from the year-earlier quarter. However, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $408 million. For 2024, net revenues were $1.60 billion, up 1.7% from 2023. The top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 1.63 billion. NII was $322.2 million, down marginally from the prior-year quarter\u2019s actual. The fall was mainly due to higher deposit costs, partly offset by growth in earning assets and higher yields on investment securities. Our estimate for NII was pegged at $318.9 million. Net interest margin (FTE basis) (non-GAAP) contracted 17 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.04%. Non-interest income was $50.9 million, up from $13.1 million in the prior year quarter. This improvement was driven by a rise in almost all fee income components, partly offset by a fall in capital markets income, mortgage banking operations income, lower dividends on non-marketable equity securities, and a decline in interchange and card transaction fees. Our estimate for the metric was $88.6 million. Non-interest expenses were $248.2 million, down 6.5% year over year. Our estimate for the same was $231 million. After excluding significant items impacting earnings, adjusted expenses rose 13.4%. As of Dec. 31, 2024, the common equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 10.6% compared with 10.0% in the prior-year quarter. At the end of the fourth quarter, average loans and leases were $33.8 billion, up marginally on a sequential basis. Average deposits totaled $37 billion, which was up 3.8%. Story Continues F.N.B. Corp\u2019s Credit Quality Deteriorates FNB\u2019s provision for credit losses was $22.3 million, jumping 68.1% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s level. Our estimate for provisions was $29.6 million. The ratio of non-performing loans and other real estate owned (OREO) to total loans and OREO increased 14 bps to 0.48%. Also, net charge-offs to total average loans were 0.24%, up 14 bps from the prior-year quarter\u2019s level. Further, total delinquency increased 13 bps to 0.83%. Our Take on FNB Stock FNB\u2019s solid liquidity position bodes well for the future. The company\u2019s top line is expected to benefit from its efforts to increase fee income, diverse revenue streams, relatively high rates and opportunistic acquisitions. However, persistently rising expenses, higher funding costs and significant commercial loan exposures amid a challenging backdrop are expected to hurt profits in the near term. F.N.B. Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise F.N.B. Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise F.N.B. Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | F.N.B. Corporation Quote Currently, FNB carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here . Performance of Other Banks First Horizon Corporation \u2019s FHN fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted EPS (excluding notable items) of 43 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents. This compares favorably with the 32 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. FHN\u2019s results benefited from a rise in NII and a decline in expenses. Also, lower provisions were another positive. However, a fall in fee income and a deteriorating capital position were major headwinds. Hancock Whitney Corp. \u2019s HWC fourth-quarter 2024 EPS of $1.40 easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.28. The bottom line compared favorably with $1.26 earned in the year-ago quarter. The results benefited from the increase in non-interest income and NII. Lower expenses and provisions were other positives. However, the decline in total loans was a headwind for HWC.

I will now turn the call over to Vince Delie, Chairman, President and CEO. Vincent Delie Thank you. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Vince Calabrese, our Chief Financial Officer; and Gary Guerrieri, our Chief Credit Officer. FNB reported fourth quarter operating net income available to common shareholders of $136.7 million or $0.38 per diluted common share. This brings our full-year 2024 operating EPS to $1.39 reflecting the successful execution of our strategic objectives. In 2024, FNB generated year-over-year loan growth of 5% and robust deposit growth of 6.9%. These results occurred throughout our diverse geographic footprint, materially outpacing the industry as we continue to leverage the strength of our technology, balance sheet and capital base, as well as our team of frontline bankers. Non-interest income continues to grow, achieving yet another record level of $350 million, highlighting our diversified business model and robust suite of products and services. We further strengthened our balance sheet and achieved a record CET1 ratio of 10.6% and increased tangible book value per share 11% to a record of $10.49. FNB remains focused on optimizing our balance sheet to drive shareholder value and best position the company for future success. As part of that commitment, we recently completed the sale of approximately $231 million of available for sale securities yielding 1.41%, and reinvested the proceeds into securities yielding 4.78%, a 337 basis point improvement with a similar duration and convexity profile. FNB also issued $500 million of senior debt in December and received favorable execution relative to similar issuances by peers signifying the confidence that fixed income markets have an FNB sustained profitability, credit quality and overall balance sheet strength. FNB has demonstrated tremendous success building a valuable deposit franchise with superior market share throughout our footprint and robust physical and digital tools. We now hold the top five deposit share in 50% of our markets and TOP10 deposit share in over 80%. Deposits ended the year at $37.1 billion, an increase of $2.4 billion from the prior year. We continue our focus on growing deposits while managing the overall cost of funds. In the fourth quarter, deposits increased $336 million link quarter with total deposit costs at 2.2%, which is expected to meaningfully out perform piers. We continue to build out our technology to assist consumers. FNB recently invested in a fintech, which provides technology that will be embedded into the eStore to enable our customers to instantaneously move their direct deposit and reoccurring transactions to FNB. We expect an improved onboarding process with fewer obstacles to drive greater success at becoming our customer's primary bank. FNB strong loan and deposit growth in 2024 outpaced the industry based on the [H8] data, more than doubling the large banks and more than tripling small banks full year growth. The strategic investments in our delivery channel have created the opportunity to deepen customer relationships, gain market share and further outperform our competitors. December marked the one year anniversary of introducing deposits into the eStore common application. Allowing customers to apply for up to 30 consumer loan and deposit products simultaneously. We are seeing impressive adoption, for example, since the launch of the eStore common app and when comparing volume to pre-launch levels over the same period. Average monthly consumer loan application volume is up 41%, and average monthly consumer deposit application volume is up nearly 30%. In addition to the functionality gained from our fintech partner, additional enhancements to the eStore are scheduled for '25 including features for insurance, small business and middle market commercial banking, providing new growth opportunities, and continuing our momentum and non-interest income, which reached an all-time high of $350 million in 2024. We recognize the benefit of having diverse revenue streams and we will continue to invest in products and services to increase non-interest income as well as relationship based deposits. Our team has had great success identifying and introducing new high value business units that complement our existing products and services. During the last 10 years, our wholesale and consumer banking groups have established or significantly expanded eight business lines that are now multimillion dollar revenue generators providing us with high returns on investment and additional granularity in our fee income composition. In the face of continuously reducing consumer banking fees, these new products and offerings have contributed to a 10-year compounded annual growth rate of more than 9% for non-interest income while creating additional value for our clients. Looking forward to this year, FNB is expanding our capital markets offerings to include commodities hedging, public finance and commercial investment banking services with plans to further enhance fee based business products for treasury management, merchant services, and payment capabilities. As we continue to grow and expand FNB, it is vital that we maintain a durable and scalable infrastructure that can be leveraged both as a competitive advantage and to meet regulatory requirements. Our comprehensive risk framework is a key consideration in executing our business strategies. This year, FNB has taken steps to strengthen internal processes, risk management, and government practices as well as introduce automation to increase efficiency, reduce fraud and create cost savings. We are leveraging our data infrastructure and technology investments to build out automation and dynamic scorecard reporting for a variety of our operational units that will enable us to drive productivity enhancements in real time. We believe this step is necessary to fully engage software automation, as we move into the future and continue to drive efficiency. FNB's approach to credit risk, a component of overall risk management has provided strong and stable asset quality that has outperformed peers through various economic cycles. Our credit performance was solid in what has been a shifting economic environment. I will now turn the call over to Gary, who will provide a review of overall credit performance. Gary? Story Continues Gary Guerrieri Thank you Vince, and good morning everyone. We ended the quarter and year end period with our asset quality metrics remaining at stable levels. Total delinquency ended the quarter at 83 basis points, up four bps from the prior quarter with NPLs and OREO at 48 basis points, up 9 bps. Net charge offs totaled 24 basis points and 19 basis points for the year, reflecting solid performance in the current economic environment. Criticized loans were down 27 bps on a linked quarter basis, reflecting continued improvement across the portfolio. Total funded provision expense for the quarter stood at $23.2 million supporting loan growth and covering charge offs. Our ending funded reserve stands at $423 million, an increase of $2.6 million ending at 1.25% unchanged from the prior quarter. When including acquired unamortized loan discounts, our reserve stands at 1.34%, and our NPL coverage position remains strong at 285% inclusive of the discounts. The non owner CRE portfolio credit metrics continue to remain at satisfactory levels with delinquency and NPLs at 99 and 84 basis points respectively. Throughout 2024, we reviewed approximately $1.8 billion of the non-owner CRE portfolio that had matured or was in the process of maturing with approximately $600 million completed in the current quarter. Additionally, approximately $2 billion of the non-owner CRE portfolio was reviewed in the quarter through our ongoing loan risk rating assessment process. We are pleased with the outcome of the reviews with a slight reduction in criticized loans. We also took aggressive action certain credits that should position the portfolio well going into the year. As part of this proactive approach to managing credit risk, we reduced the non-owner CRE portfolio exposure by approximately $300 million in the quarter ending the year at 220% of total risk based capital. We continue to perform targeted reviews of other portfolios each quarter along with a full portfolio stress test. Our stress testing results for this quarter have been consistent with prior quarters with our current ACL covering over 90% of our projected charge offs in a severe economic downturn, including in the recent quarter where we applied an additional shock on non-owner occupied CRE. In closing, our credit metrics ended the year at solid levels. With our loan portfolio continuing to perform as expected in the current economic environment. Our ongoing investments in credit risk management systems, analytics, and staff allow us to quickly identify risk and take proactive actions. We look forward to achieving prudent loan growth in the year ahead while remaining consistent in our core underwriting and credit philosophy. I will now turn the call over to Vince Calabrese, our Chief Financial Officer for his remarks. Vincent Calabrese Thanks Gary. Good morning. Today, I will focus on the fourth quarter's financial results including details on the investment securities restructuring completed in November, the debt issuance in the renewable energy investment tax credit financing transaction, as well as walking through our guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2025. Fourth quarter operating net income totaled $136.7 million or $0.38 per share when excluding the $34 million pretax loss on the investment securities restructure. As part of our ongoing balance sheet management strategies, $231 million of lower yielding securities were sold during the fourth quarter. Proceeds were reinvested in securities with an average yield of 4.78%, with similar duration and convexity profile. Because the sold investment securities were inavailable for sale with the unrealized loss already reflected in AOCI, the realized loss did not incrementally impact tangible book value which increased 10.8% on a year-over-year basis to a record at $10.49 per share. In December, FNB further enhanced its balance sheet flexibility and liquidity position by issuing $500 million of senior notes maturing in December 2030. The new debt will serve as a replacement $450 million of senior and sub known maturities occurring in the latter half of 2025. The fourth quarter's performance also includes contributions from our commercial leasing team, who originate renewable energy financing transactions as part of their business model. In the fourth quarter, the company recognized renewable energy investment tax credits of $28.4 million as a benefit to income taxes from a solar project financing transaction. This was partially offset by related $10.4 million pretax non-credit valuation impairment on the financing receivable which is included in other non-interest expense. While we continue to have an active pipeline in the renewable energy sector, closings can be difficult to predict given long construction lead times. Total assets at yearend 2024 were $48.6 billion, up 5.3% for the year. Fourth quarter total loans and leases increased $222 million or 0.7% linked quarter ending the year $33.9 billion. The tumor loan growth of $240 million was led by residential mortgage which remained strong despite rising interest rates. Commercial loans and leases were essentially flat, reflecting reduced line of credit utilization, scheduled reductions in CRE to the permanent market and lower capital investment levels somewhat offset by strong production and equipment finance and renewable energy project financing. Full-year 2024 spot loan growth was $1.6 billion or 5%, reflecting the $431 million auto loan sale in the third quarter. Commercial loans and leases growth of $667 million or 3.3% benefited from both our geographic footprint and diverse lines of business. For example, the Carolina markets generated over half of the total commercial loan growth for 2024, further down shedding the value of our investments in higher growth markets. Consumer loans grew $949 million or 8% on a spot basis in 2024 with residential mortgage growth driving the increase. Total deposits ended December at $37.1 billion, an increase of $336 million or nearly 1% linked quarter. Spot interest bearing demand balances grew 4.2% linked quarter driven by strength in interest bearing checking and money market balances. Time deposits declined 2.2% (inaudible) quarter to $7.5 billion driven by reduced levels of brokered CDs, given the overall continued strength in deposit generation. Average non-interest bearing deposits were essentially flat linked quarter in the midst of non-interest bearing to total deposits at quarter end was 26.3% compared to 26.8% last quarter, reflecting the strong interest bearing deposit growth and stable non-interest bearing demand deposits. Success of our ongoing balance sheet management and deposit gathering initiatives led to a loan to deposit ratio of 91.5% at year end, a more than 160 basis point improvement from year end 2023 and over 500 basis point improvement from peak levels in mid-2024. Fourth quarter, net interest income totaled $322.2 million, a slight decrease of $1.1 million from the prior quarter. Average earning assets were up $360 million linked quarter on higher investment securities and liquidity balances. Average loans rose only slightly linked quarter given the impact on consumer loans from the auto loan sale completed in the third quarter. Earning asset yields decreased 17 basis points to 5.34%, as the federal reserve interest rate cuts to begin in September impacted variable rate loan resets. Offsetting this impact was a 21 basis point increase in the securities portfolio yield to 3.38% driven by the portfolio restructuring. Interest bearing deposit costs decreased eight basis points linked quarter to 3% and cost on borrowings declined 37 basis points to [$479] Our total cumulative spot deposit beta since the fed interest rate cuts began in September 2024 equals 16% at yearend 2024 versus our 15% expectation provided on the third quarter call. The resulting fourth quarter net interest margin was 3.04%, down four basis points linked quarter. Average rates paid on time and money market balances declined throughout the quarter, bringing the December net interest margin one basis point higher than the margin for the full quarter. We continue to strategically lower deposit pricing in step with the downward trend in the fed funds rate and we expect a relatively stable net interest margin in the first quarter of 2025, dependent on federal reserve actions. Turning to non-interest income and expense. Non-interest income was $50.9 million or $84.9 million on an operating basis, when excluding the impact of the securities restructure. Mortgage banking income rose $1.4 million linked quarter which included a mortgage servicing rights valuation recovery partially offset by lower gain on sale margins given the sharp increase in mortgage rates during the fourth quarter. Capital markets income benefited from higher syndication and swap fees as well as strong debt capital markets and international banking revenue. Noninterest expense totaled $248.2 million, a $14 million increase from the prior quarter on an operating basis. Approximately $10.4 million of the linked quarter increase was driven by expenses related to the renewable energy tax credit transaction mentioned earlier. Salaries and employee benefits expenses were up $1.9 million linked quarter, reflecting higher than expected employer paid health care costs that were $6 million higher due to an increased volume of high cost claims which was partially offset by lower production and performance related variable compensation. Strategic hiring associated with our focus to grow market share and continued investments in our risk management infrastructure also continued this quarter. The efficiency ratio remains solid at 56.9% for the fourth quarter, and we continue to manage our expense base in a disciplined manner which is expensive to result in a significantly improved operating leverage performance in the second half of 2025. FMBs capital levels reached all-time highs, the CET1 ratio at 10.6% and tangible common equity ratio at 8.2%, providing flexibility to deploy capital to increase shareholder value. On a year over year basis, tangible book value per common share increased $1.2 or 10.8%, $10.49, demonstrating our commitment to strong internal capital generation. Let's now look at the guidance for the first quarter and full-year 2025 starting with the balance sheet. For full-year 2025, period and loans and deposits are expected to grow mid-single digits versus year-end 2024, as we continue to increase our market share across our diverse geographic footprint. Full-year net interest income is expected to be between $1.345 billion and $1.385 billion. With the first quarter expected between $315 million and $325 million. Our guidance assumes a 25 basis point rate cut in March and another 25 basis point rate cut in June. Non-interest income for the year is expected to be between $350 million and $370 million. With the first quarter expected in the range of $85 million to $90 million. This is inclusive of the new capital markets and treasury management product offerings, Vince mentioned earlier. Full-year guidance for noninterest expense is expected to be between $965 million to $985 million, representing a 4.6% increase at the midpoint, when excluding the tax credit related expenses in the fourth quarter of 2024. First quarter, non-interest expenses are expected in a range of $245 million to $255 million. This compensation expense is seasonally higher in the first quarter, due to normal long term stock compensation and higher payroll taxes. The 2025 provision expense is expected to be between $85 million and $105 million, dependent on net loan growth and charge off activity. Lastly, the full year effective tax rate should be between 21% and 22%, which does not include any investment tax credit activity that may occur. Before I turn the call over, I would like to congratulate Vince Delie, as he moves into his 20th year of service at FNB. During his tenure, he has successfully led FNB through multiple economic cycles and some of the most challenging times our industry has faced. Its visionary leadership, guided FNB to grow from $5 billion assets to nearly $50 billion. Catapulted FNB as an industry leader in digital banking tools and data analytics and developed a culture that values teamwork in doing what is right for all stakeholders. This was recently named the 2024 CEO of the year by the CEO magazine, a well-deserved award. This recognition builds on the multitude of awards FNB has achieved under Vince' leadership. Among the long list of honors, we are especially proud to have been named a list of the best, most trusted and most admired companies in the US and around the globe by prominent organizations such as Forbes, Time and Newsweek. We have received more than 100 Greenwich Excellence and best brand awards in just over a decade. Our President's E award for export service and gained consistent national and regional recognition as a top workplace. Now, having earned more than 70 awards is a leading workplace based on employee feedback. And in addition to our highly rated mobile banking app, we have garnered both international and national acclaim for omnichannel banking platform led by our innovative eStore and clicks to bridge strategy. On behalf of the FNB team and our Board of Directors, thank you, Vince for your dedication in leading FNB. Vincent Delie Thanks for the kind words, Vince. My 20 years at FNB have been some of the best of my professional career and is largely due to the dedication of my executive team and all of our employees. Every organization has a leader, but very few have the quality people that we have at FNB which makes all of this possible. So, thank you. Reflecting back on 2024, we achieved new milestones and set new records all while bringing value to all of our stakeholders. FNB celebrated its 160th anniversary, moved into a new 26 story state of the art headquarters in Pittsburgh's lower Hill district neighborhood and expanded our digital capabilities in our mobile application and the proprietary eStore in common application where we continue to lead the industry in customer engagement. We generated quality loans throughout our footprint while upholding our conservative and consistent underwriting standards. Deposit growth was pure leading and led to a 500 basis point improvement in our loan to deposit ratio from the peak during the year. We also diversified revenue streams to achieve record non-interest income, strengthened our balance sheet with a record CET1 ratio of 10.6%, through tangible book value 11% year over year. Achieved an operating return on tangible common equity of 14.5% and continued our conservative risk management practices across all lines of business. I want to thank our teams for their contributions and our shareholders for their continued support as we celebrate our 2024 milestones and build on our momentum in 2025. Thank you, and we will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Question and Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions) Daniel Tamayo, Raymond James. Daniel Tamayo Thank you. Good morning, everyone (multiple speakers) To be first -- and maybe first on the fee income initiatives that you mentioned, Vince to how they factor into to the guidance this year, just curious timing on those investments and initiatives and kind of your thoughts around, what may be ultimate growth prospects for those new businesses and investments? Vincent Delie Sure, a portion of the investment's already been recognized from an expense run rate perspective because we brought some people online and reflected in the expenses reflected in the guidance as well. We've had pretty good success starting several of these businesses, particularly in the capital markets line. And, I think with the -- we began the debt capital markets group and we immediately began generating revenues. So that became pretty much neutral in year one, enough revenue to offset the expense that we brought on. I would expect the same to be true of several of the business units that were starting out public finance, for example, we're starting to build out that team. I would expect that to begin to generate revenue in '25. And the break-even point is fairly quick for us. And then we shift over in '26 into some pretty attractive terms in that business, in particular, in the investment banking and advisory business, the same is true. That's a little bit different. But, we've identified a group that we're going to bring on and I would expect that to begin to generate revenue immediately because there's an ongoing business stream and clients associated with what we're doing there. So all in, I don't see it being, incredibly accretive to earnings year one, but in '26, I would expect it to be meaningfully impactful. So we're pretty excited about those two areas in particular. And then in terms of just building out the existing businesses, we -- we've added commodities hedging to our derivatives program. We have actually built out our syndications capability. So that's starting to move even further in the right direction, and we did pretty well just for record level of left the syndications for us. So as our scale has increased and our balance sheet has increased, it's given us the ability to pursue larger transactions with bigger fees associated with it. So that's been a positive for us and really benefited from the build out of that syndications team. That's -- our strategy was to create a number of areas to support our clients, but also to provide the company with a very diverse set of the income sources. And I think it's played out pretty well for us. I mean, you can see it over time and we've grown that, as I said, 9% on a compounded annual basis, and I would expect us to continue to do well in '25 and into '26 in a number of categories. So, we're pretty excited about that and. Vincent Calabrese I would just add to the incremental cost to start, these is very small. And as we talked about in Vince's comments, we have eight businesses that we've started and expanded and quickly, even the ones from scratch become million dollar plus revenue businesses quickly. Vincent Delie (multiple speakers) Vincent Calabrese Go ahead, I'm sorry. Vincent Delie And bringing everybody together in our new facility, we have a trading floor, we have capital markets area. It's really exciting. It makes it easier to recruit people, as we bring them in, they could see our full capabilities on display, if you ever get a chance, I'd encourage you to come and visit. So it's, it's pretty impressive. Daniel Tamayo (technical difficulty) Appreciate all that color. I guess maybe a follow-up, you talked about the costs associated with those and how some of them have been incurred already, and maybe some of them are not as meaningful as we think. But the guidance for '25, you talked about (inaudible) for a little less than 5% growth on the expense side. Just curious the primary drivers of that? And then think you talked about some cost savings initiatives on the call last quarter. Just curious if there's still a plan or an outlook for some initiatives that might drive that expense growth rate down into '26. Vincent Calabrese Yeah, I would just -- let me just start with the fourth quarter, right. So we came in at $248 was above our range, which was $225 million to $235 million. And really two items that drove that, the $10.4 million valuation impairment charge that we mentioned related to the investment tax credit offset a piece of the $28.4 million tax credit. And then we had a $6 million increase in health care costs that came in just an increased number 50% increase in kind of the high-cost claims above $100,000. So those two things have affected the fourth quarter. So as far as kind of a run rate going into next year, you won't have the $10.4 million and the $6 million. I think the claims will still be a little bit higher than what we expected for '24, when we started the year, but it will definitely be down quite close to 10%, kind of actual 24% to 25%. So that's kind of baked into the guidance. Things like as we approach $50 billion, there's [height] standard requirements that are out there. So we've been working on that for a couple of years. And there's probably a couple of million dollars of expense that was in there in '24. We'll have probably a similar increase in '25. Again, this is all baked into the guidance. And then it stabilizes as you get into '26. So as we just kind of build out some of the kind of first and second lines of defense. Vincent Delie Yes. And I'd say you're seeing that. That's why the expenses are elevated. You're seeing the build-out of the risk management area to comply with heightened standards. That has been happening. Otherwise, our efficiency ratio would have been in a much better position, and I would expect as we move through [2000] there's more spend coming, it's reflected in the guide, which is why we're guiding, I think, on a core basis, 4%, (multiple speakers) So that's reflected it would have been better. I mean there are a number of expense initiatives that we're pursuing to offset that expense build, which keeps it under 5%, 4%. So as we move into '26, we would expect to be at least have the operating expenses, the salary expense reflected in the run rate for those compliance issues. Vincent Calabrese And I would just remind everybody, first quarter, we have a seasonal increase from restarting the year payroll taxes and restricted stock that happens every year in the first quarter. That's $12 million to $15 million of expenses that you'll see fourth quarter to first quarter. Again, that's all baked into the guidance. And then the cost saving initiatives every year, as you know, for I don't know how many five, six, seven years, we've had a meaningful cost saving target comes out of a variety of which areas under negotiation, space optimization and facility optimization and just continuous process improvements, leveraging AI and other automation tools that we have with the company. So -- and we hit that every single year. So that's part of kind of how we fund some of these additional expenses and new initiatives. Daniel Tamayo Okay, great. Well, thank you for taking my questions. Vincent Delie (inaudible) Operator Russell Gunther, Stephens. Russell Gunther Hey, good morning guys. (multiple speakers) I wanted to start on the margin and just get a sense for how you're thinking about deposit cost progression over the course of the year. It looks like the guide as you matching loan growth and deposit growth. So just trying to get a sense for what the competitive pressures on the deposit cost will be? And if you could just kind of tie that into the net new margin or spread touching on where your new commercial loan yields are coming in? Vincent Calabrese Yeah. I would say slide 15 does a good job kind of looking at the different levers that we have as far as balance sheet pricing. Just kind of as a reminder, in our cumulative up data, we finished at 39.8% (technical difficulty) We outperformed the peers on the way up by 8 percentage points for total deposits and interest-bearing deposit data basis. Our team, I think, did a very good job managing deposit costs on the way up, kind of customer by customer, established a good plan as pivoted to start going down. So our goal would be to outperform again on the way down. The timing of it, right, it matters, obviously. But from an overall beta perspective, we're still comfortable with kind of a cumulative down data in the mid-30s. By the end of this year, kind of in the low to mid-20s is kind of what we're forecasting. To date, we've lowered our best rates on CDs and money marketing account by 100 to 125 basis points. So the Fed's move to 100. We've moved those kind of lock up for a little bit more. Our guys every day are working on kind of optimizing the deposit cost. But keep in mind, too, we're still growing deposits. So that's been a focus for us to bring our loan-to-deposit ratio down. So the balancing act is still growing deposits and bringing down the deposit rates will continue, and our guys are monitoring the competitors, monitoring the elasticity with our customers and just kind of continue to work it down. So that's all baked into the guidance. We have two Fed cuts in there kind of March and June as our guidance slide says. So it's just a very active process. And again, the goal will be to outperform on the way down. Russell Gunther I appreciate the color, Vince. Thank you. And then just last one for me. I appreciate the market share stats you shared earlier, TOP5 and 50%, TOP10 and 80%. Maybe just touch on specific markets you'd like to increase that share and how you plan to go about it touching on M&A, if that is something you'd look to do in '25? Thanks, guys. Vincent Delie Well, I'm going to go on the record of saying I would want to be an investment banker today. So I said I wouldn't want to be an investment banker a couple of years ago. I think that's all changed. I think that we're headed into an environment that permits M&A to occur naturally. And I think it's a healthy thing in the industry as smaller banks try to achieve and it helps all the way around the board -- helps the shareholder helps clients, right, obtain capital, creates efficiency. I think we're back to more M&A activity. Having said that, FNB is still going to focus on the same strategy, which is the optimal deployment of capital. So we're going to look at a variety of ways to deploy capital, not just M&A. I think we've broadened our footprint. You asked about what markets we're most interested in. We're going to continue to build out our presence in the Carolinas and in the Southeast. We have tons of potential to continue to grow. Deposits, particularly in Charlotte and Raleigh and the Piedmont Triad. I think we've only scratched the surface. As we build out our product set in TM in particular, there's a tremendous amount of upside for us because we're established we've had bankers in the market for five-plus years, and our brand awareness has improved dramatically. So there's significant upside there. I think in the Mid-Atlantic region, particularly in Washington, D.C. and Northern Virginia, there are opportunities for us. We continue to expand from a de novo perspective in those markets and build out our delivery channel. I think there's upside in those markets from a deposit perspective. And then moving into our more traditional markets, we've done a really good job in Pittsburgh, and we're worth [$1billion] in total deposits were number two in true retail deposit market share, excluding global custody of banks that have large broker portfolios. So I think we'll continue to focus on the areas that are more mature for us to drive deposit growth. Again, there's plenty of opportunities. So there are some very large players that control big chunks of market share that are much larger than us, and we have an opportunity to grow our deposit base in Cleveland, and Pittsburgh and Baltimore. (multiple speakers) Yes. And the digital investment, the -- on the consumer side, flipping over to the consumer side, we've invested pretty heavily in the eStore in the platform. Most of our focus has been strategically placed client acquisition, ease acquisition of clients. So the eStore concept itself where you can purchase up to 30 consumer products simultaneously, loan of deposit products, by filling out one application as an example. We are continuing to add to that platform. We will have capabilities this year that will permit us to move repetitive payments that occur ACH transactions that occur in checking accounts, direct deposit will be moved instantaneously. So when a customer comes in, opens an account with us through the eStore through an investment we're making with a fintech company partner that we picked up along the way, we're going to be able to move those things immediately. That's going to have a meaningful impact on our ability to maintain our client primacy as we call it, which helps grow noninterest-bearing deposits and improve the margin over time. And also gross fee income, positive good fee income in the consumer bank. So those are the things that we're doing to drive share. I think geographically, we're in a pretty good spot, and certainly, the focus will be on the areas that I mentioned. And Virginia, the Washington, D.C. area, contingent growth in the Carolinas and taking advantage of the more mature markets where we have increased brand recognition. Anyway, that's the strategy. I think we're sitting in a very good position to continue to achieve our objectives moving into '25 and '26. Russell Gunther I appreciate it guys. Thank you. Vincent Delie Yes. Thank you. Operator Kelly Motta, KBW. Kelly Motta Hi. Thank you. Thank you so much for the question. I guess it's kind of just stepping back and thinking through, operating leverage. I believe your prepared remarks said, you expect positive operating leverage to emerge in the back half of this year. Just wondering if you kind of look ahead. How should we be thinking about the overall efficiency of the bank and what, your balance between longer term of the investments you continue to make and continue to reap benefits for you versus getting to that operating leverage of that just wondering how you guys from a management perspective approach that? Vincent Calabrese Yeah. I can comment. The efficiency ratio, we've talked about the investments that we've been making and that we have continued to make. And even with that, we continue to have an efficiency ratio that's in the top quartile. So I think that's a focus for us. And we've consistently -- in the quarter last year, we were in the top quartile, if not the TOP2 or 3. So that's kind of an underpinning to it. And then positive operating leverage as we move forward, I mean as we get into this year, I mean, we've made the statement about the full year and really on both the dollar and a percentage basis and definitely getting there by the second half of the year. Some of that will be dependent on what happens with interest rates, obviously. But what's baked into our guidance and what we're shooting for would be having that positive operating leverage for the full year with it really kind of starting to ramp up in the second half of the year. So we're disciplined managers of expenses we've always been. So while we're investing, we're taking out anywhere from $10 million to $20 million in cost savings through the initiatives that I mentioned earlier. And it's -- again, it's a balancing act. But a lot of the (inaudible) charge is always, we're investing where we can grow revenue. So we're not very mindful of the types of things that we're investing in. So it's clearly a focus for us, and it will be nice to return to positive operating leverage this year for sure. Vincent Delie Yeah. Kelly, as you know, we are still pretty dependent on net interest income. So that changes the interest rate as the slope of the curve changes and the interest rate environment changes. What we need to stay focused on is being as efficient as possible and getting the highest possible returns we can capital and investment and that's been our focus. I think from a strategic perspective, what's the catalyst to keep us sufficient moving into the future, irrespective of the changes in rates. I'm very excited about automation the use of AI, our ability to track on an automated way, the activities that are going on in operations. And we have a project underway as well to optimize the reporting within the operating units that we have, which should produce pretty significant results as we move forward from an efficiency perspective. So being able to monitor thousands of actions that occur every day in our operations area. That's going to help us in the future develop tools from an AI perspective that will help us drive efficiency. So there's quite a bit of technology that's coming that should help us from an expense perspective as we move into the future, not here today, but it's coming, and we're preparing for. So you ask kind of long term strategically, that would be my answer. I think there's a tremendous opportunity in the industry, not just with FNB to take expense out of the operations area. Kelly Motta (multiple speakers) that is incredibly helpful and I apologize if you've touched on this one, earlier in the call. But, given the change in administration, have you seen any greater optimism among your commercial clients and willingness to make investments and perhaps drawn on lines of credit or undertake new investments that would necessitate, new loans or is it still just too early to see any kind of change there? Vincent Delie No, I think based on the conversations I've had with clients, I think they're more optimistic about the conditions for business as we move forward. Obviously, there seems to be euphoria about it. I think that we're starting to see the beginning of planning for capital investment, which leads to increased demand. And particularly, again, I'm excited, I think the things that I spoke about for us also applies to other industries. And because of those gains in efficiency, there should be increased profitability and the ability to deploy capital and receive higher returns, right on investment. So I think over time, we're going to see a building of demand for particularly C&I opportunities. Vincent Calabrese So our customers doing acquisitions, right? Vincent Delie And customers pursuing M&A transactions. That's the other side of it. We have everything kind of just died, right? Everything just stopped. And I think we'll see more M&A activity within our customer base and in the markets that we serve, which will lead to opportunities for us because that creates opportunities for us to participate in the credit facilities and provide capital market services. I think the investment banking platform that we're launching for middle market companies is also the perfect time because I think you'll see more activity even in the lower end of the spectrum. And that will create opportunities for us to benefit from the advisory fees, but also to roll the proceeds of the sale into our wealth platform. So I think the investments we're making, given the time that we're in and where we are in the cycle, I think, are pretty smart. So I hope it all pays off and works out the way we expect it to (multiple speakers) I think there is demand. Kelly Motta I appreciate all the color on all front. Thanks guys. I'll step back. Vincent Calabrese One other thing I could comment on to Kelly was just the -- we've talked about the swaps that are rolling off, and that's a positive to this year. That's been about a $10 million a quarter drag to net interest income, and those have began to roll off. $250 -- there's $1 billion in total, $250 million a quarter. The first one rolled off on January 1, and the rest of them May, July and October. So that $10 million a quarter drag will be going away as you go through the year. So that's also additive to the net interest income as we get into the second, third, fourth quarters. Kelly Motta Thank you so much. Vincent Delie Thank you. Operator Manuel Navas, D.A. Davidson. Manuel Navas Hey, good morning. You might have touched on a little bit of this but can you kind of talk about the cadence or the pace of NII and NIM across '25 stable nim in the first quarter? You have the cut in March in June. Where would it go from there across the year? Vincent Calabrese Yeah. I would just say, I mean, the fourth quarter feels like it's up here for us. So as you look to the first quarter, we would expect it to go up, I don't know, a few basis points, 2 to 3 basis points or so. And then really just gradually build as you go through the year with the March and June [cost take] in there. And with the [site] going a little bit slower, another key point, we're still cash-sensitive overall. We continue to organically move back to neutral from an interest rate risk standpoint. The delay slowdown in the Fed cuts is helpful in the short run for us because it helps you kind of catch up and manage the deposit costs down, as I mentioned earlier. So -- and we have -- because again, that slide 15 does a good job with kind of talking about the different moving parts. But we have -- just to give you a few data points, and we have $10 billion of liabilities that are repricing today. They have another [$5.2 billion] in CDs that mature in the next six months, [$3.2 billion] in the next three months at [43%] We've been putting on CDs in the kind of 350 to 360 net barriers. So that's positive there, too. And then we have billion (inaudible) annual cash flows from investment portfolio that's rolling off in around 3% or 4%. And we're currently reinvesting in the or 480 to 490 kind of area. So those are some of the similar levers going on. And then you have the loans, you have the $16 billion that are variable rate loans that are tied to SOFR (inaudible) And with the Fed moving slower, we get the benefit of that in our net interest income and our guide. Our guide has that the two (inaudible) in there. Manuel Navas What's the sensitivity? Would you go towards the high end of your guide with less cuts? Is that the way to think about it? Vincent Calabrese We have fewer cuts for sure. In the short run, it's additive, it's -- you still want those cuts the short end come down as you get into '26 and beyond. But in the short run, it's additive to one less cut. Manuel Navas Okay. How does I heard the response on business optimism maybe not yet translating into loan growth. How are pipelines looking right now? And should we expect a little bit slower first start of the year in loan growth or will it come in pretty strong from the, from the start giving the optimism is doing is, is up and what's the regional tilt of that growth still towards the Carolinas? Vincent Calabrese Yeah. I mean that -- those are great questions. Last quarter, when I was asking a similar question. I said that pipelines were down, which they are, continue to be. We went through the holiday season, the slower seasonal period for commercial banking at the end of the year. So pipelines still remain lower, probably 10% to 15% in a variety of markets pretty much across the board. But I expect that -- that's in the short term, I look at the 90-day pipeline more than I look at the long-term pipeline because that's what's more likely to come in, right? As you look at those pipelines, there are starting to build, I would expect momentum to build throughout the year, as I said on the last call, and we're expecting demand to pick up fairly briskly towards the second half of the year. And that kind of aligns with the normal seasonal cycle for C&I and C&I lending, in particular, commercial banking. So that would be my expectation. This is typically a lower period. I would say from a geographic perspective, we're seeing -- we've seen continued growth in Pittsburgh because we're mature. We see opportunities here. So we continue to get those. In the Carolinas, we've had great traction. The pipelines are actually slightly better in the Carolinas continue to trend in the right direction. So I would expect us to do well there. And then I think Mid-Atlantic's trailing a little bit as we move through the year, I think there's upside in those markets. So that's pretty much how we see the world. But it's still led by the Carolinas and our core Pittsburgh operation or specific drivers for our pipeline moving forward. Manuel Navas What would be the potential upside, if the curve continues to steepen in the back half of the year? And how much is that already in the guidance? And I'll step back after this question. Vincent Delie I don't think -- I'll let Vince answer that question, but I don't think that we have upside baked into the guidance. And we look at the yield curve as it slowed when we look at the forecast, and we model out our guide based upon what we think is going to happen with rates. And as we sit today, the yield curve still slightly inverted, right? I expect that to correct over time. And the more correction we have, the more impactful that is for banks in general. So I would look at it that way. I think in the short run, as Vince mentioned, there's also a lag associated with pricing on the liability side, right, when things shift. So if there are fewer rate cuts, that's going to help you in the short run, but in the long run, you're going to be stuck in a longer cycle with an inverted or flat yield curve. So it's kind of a tricky question, right? And there's quite a bit that goes into the modeling. I don't know if you want to add to that. Vincent Calabrese I would just add going back to betas, right? So the better job we do managing the deposit costs down, obviously, that can put you into the higher end of the range. And that's clearly focus daily briefly, every weekly price may we have. So that's something that better we do, the better we do that outperform peers that's additive to the net interest income, but it will be higher. Vincent Delie But we're not taking -- we don't shift to take bets on interest rates. We're managing the book to neutral. And we're just doing whatever we can, right, from a pricing perspective, a client perspective deposit mix. We do everything we can to try to optimize or maximize profitability in the environment that we're in. So that's how we operate. And I think you've got the guide and the guide is based on what we know today. We'll see how the year plays out. Vincent Calabrese Yeah. We've done a nice job as we've been growing deposits, bringing in new relationships. And as you broaden those relationships. Again, that's very additive from a profitability standpoint and broadening the relationships as you get into this year and into next year. And the steeper yield curve, clearly, as you exit '25 to '26 is very much a positive for us. Manuel Navas Thank you for the commentary. Vincent Calabrese Yeah. Vincent Delie Thanks for your question. Thank you. Operator Frank Schiraldi, Piper Sandler. Frank Schiraldi Good morning, just a couple on first for Gary on credit, just curious your thoughts on, do we see continued normalization here in credit? And your reserve has been very stable over the last few quarters, just curious if your thoughts on 2025. And maybe if that could be a potential tailwind, some reserve releases and any assumption on continued reductions in non-owner occupied commercial real estate. Gary Guerrieri Yeah, Frank, in reference to where we sit today with the reserve, it has been extremely stable. And I think that's a reflection of the stability in the portfolio as to where we sit going into 2025 and the position of each individual portfolio within the total of all the assets. So in terms of looking ahead, I mean, we've guided to a fairly stable type of provision expenses. We are extremely aggressive in managing the book of business, and we feel good as to where it sits today. We were aggressive in Q4 around the position of the book. So we feel good about where we have been positioned at the moment and we'll continue to work through the existing environment that the industry is facing. In terms of CRE, during the year, just from a total nonowner occupied CRE standpoint, the quarter, I mentioned in my remarks, we were down $300 million just in that quarter. For the full year, it was in excess of $500 million, and that was really centered around construction being down $370 million and office being down about $350 million. We're continuing to focus on moving the non-owner exposure as a percentage of capital down. So, I would expect to see that continue as we move forward. The secondary markets have opened up quite a bit. We saw some assets move there, which is what we expect them to do. So that surely is a positive event as well. And we do see that continuing as we move through the year ahead. Frank Schiraldi Okay. I appreciate that. And then just lastly, Vince just curious, your, your broad thoughts looking at the regulatory framework, the idea, being maybe a little bit of a lighter regulatory touch in the new administration. I just curious your thoughts is that just me, maybe a more streamlined, M&A process for the industry and maybe a pick up there or do you see any specific potential benefits to reduce your expense burden here? You mentioned the heightened standards, questions whether some of those thresholds may move higher. So just curious, your broad thoughts there? Vincent Delie Yeah, I'm not sure that the impact of banks our size will be immediate in terms of expense reduction. I think that given the bank failures that occurred several years ago, the demeanor of the regulators shouldn't change materially in the short run. I think in the long run, as the administration carries on, I think we'll see some relief. I think that relief is mainly -- I just -- I believe that the previous administration was anti-M&A kind of across the board. So a lot of the policies that were imposed and the regulators were enforcing rules that prevented banks from doing M&A. I'm convinced of that. I think that will ease up. So I think it will permit not just in the banking sector, but across the Board, permit more M&A to occur, which is why I would want to be an investment banker today, not a few years ago. But I think generally, the risks associated with operating a large institution aren't changing and the rigor in which the regulators pursue enforcement of regulations that are on the books isn't going to change materially. I think that will be pretty steady, particularly with the OCC and the regulatory bodies that have been more consistent in the application of the rules. I think what's going to go away are the enforcement actions in some of the things that happen kind of outside of the normal risk management, safety and soundness regime. I think there seems to be a different appetite for those types of moves by the regulators under this administration. So I think for the large banks, they'll see some relief. They've talked about Basel III changes to capital requirements and liquidity requirements. Obviously, those changes trickle down to us but the immediate impacts for larger institutions. That's kind of my view. I think we'll see some relief, but it's not going to result in material reduction in expense. I don't see that happening. (multiple speakers) Yeah. Thank you. Vincent Calabrese Thanks, Frank. Operator (Operator Instructions) Brian Martin, Janney Montgomery. Brian Martin Hey, good morning guys. (multiple speakers) Okay. Hey, just one question the one kind of current. I think you talked about the deposits, Vince, but just on the loan yields, just kind of competition, kind of what you're seeing there in terms of, yields today. So can you give a little color on how those are trending? Vincent Calabrese Sure. I mean if you look at the new loans that we made during the fourth quarter, came on around 6.5%. (inaudible) that's kind of where we've been putting loans on the books the last couple of months of November and December. So it's down from the prior quarter at 30 basis points or so. But at a 6.5% rate, it's still 66 basis points greater than the overall portfolio yield. So it's clearly still additive to that. But that's kind of where we're putting kind of with the blend of loans that we're putting on the blended rate right around that 6.5% level. Brian Martin Got you. Okay. And then just in terms of the opportunities on the capital side, I guess, can you talk about, weighing the share buybacks versus kind of the potential, I guess on the M&A side, just in terms of, if we do think about M&A or there are opportunities this year, can you just remind us on that front if it's more a it's just kind of the earn back that you guys would be looking for. And then just in terms of, with any potential deals, be more, smaller and additive to an existing market or is it more you're looking to get to a new market? I mean, the markets you're in, are pretty dynamic, just wondering if your expectation would be to be looking somewhere new or just kind of filling in kind of, like maybe some of the more recent ones on that front so? Vincent Delie Sure. We -- as I've said before, we haven't really changed our position from an M&A perspective. We would entertain opportunities. We're not looking for transformational transactions. I think the company is pretty well positioned in some fairly dynamic markets, and we have some work to do internally, right, to ensure that we generate the returns that we can achieve in those markets and manage risk. So I think from our perspective, we're focusing -- still focusing internally. We think we can get some pretty significant growth out of the existing footprint and some very -- grow some very profitable businesses that will help us from a return perspective. And then in terms of earn back in the event that we were to find an opportunity that was appealing to us, we would expect a very quick return on tangible book value dilution. So I'd say, continue to look within three years, right, returns have to be substantial. We look for internal rates of return in the high-teens to the twenties, the ability to (inaudible) cost out fairly effectively, efficiently. And then looking at the deposit franchises, we would not want to dilute. I've said this before. We've built a pretty strong deposit franchise with a healthy demand deposit mix, and we're not looking to dilute that. We're also trying to manage our efficiency ratio. So if we did something, we would want to make sure that we could take a substantial amount of cost out. I mentioned that from a credit perspective in terms of the portfolio, we're not looking to grow CRE exposure, right. We've been reducing that over time. I think we're better than peers right, when you look at it relative to Tier 1 capital, right, Gary? Concentration perspective, we're looking to continue to improve that, focusing on more and larger C&I opportunities, which produce a high return for us because of the capital markets fees and lower risk profile. From a loan-to-deposit perspective, as I mentioned, we brought that down fairly significantly. We would like to continue to do that. So as we move into the more robust part of the year from an economic expansion perspective or loan demand perspective, we have the liquidity and the capital to be a player. I think we're moving in the right direction to position us to really take advantage of the changes that are occurring economically. And I feel really good about where we are. And that's kind of the strategy. So I'm not fixated on M&A. I don't think that's the only answer. And then again, we do look at share buybacks if it makes sense, if the earn-back is reasonable and it provides us with the EPS accretion. We're looking at the dividend every quarter. We examine what's happening, what are our capital needs. We're not going to sit here with excess capital either. So depending on how things play out, we're going to look at that as well. So we kind of look at each area and we look for optimal deployment of capital for the shareholders. That's been our mantra and we're going to continue to do that. Vincent Calabrese Yes, CET1 ratio at 10.6%. And, the expectation of higher levels of earnings, higher level of internal capital generation, it gives us more flexibility to pursue the things events mentioned with our stock valuation still very attractive, share repurchase is definitely part of the consideration. Vincent Delie But that's not -- that capital is not already in a hole in our pocket, right? We're not running out to deploy the capital. We want to make sure we make really smart decisions that position us to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace that provide the shareholders with the absolute best returns. We're not looking to change the risk profile of the company or change -- I think we're operating very effectively and have proven over a long period of time that we can produce result better than peers. So that's going to be the focus. Hope that's helpful. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll be ending today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Vince Delie for any closing remarks. Vincent Delie Well, thank you very much. I appreciate all the questions and the interest in FNB. We continue to be very optimistic about the momentum that we've created. We had a pretty solid year in a choppy environment. So kudos to the management team and to the employees for all the work that they've done and I can't think of a better place to be for the last 20 years than here. So it's been very exciting. You've thrown a lot at us, a pandemic, a financial crisis, a liquidity crisis, bond crash. But we're here, we're surviving. We're doing really well and I appreciate my team. I, they've done tremendous things, no matter what the circumstances are, we rally together and we get things done and I couldn't ask for a better career or group of people to work with. So, thank you very much. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call and presentation. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your line.

High Provisions, Stock Falls 4.2% Zacks Equity Research Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 2:46 PM 5 min read In This Article: EWBC -2.19% FNB -2.49% Shares of East West Bancorp, Inc. EWBC lost 4.2% in the after-market trading session on lower-than-expected quarterly results. Its fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.08 lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.17. Nonetheless, the bottom line increased 4% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s level. Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar. The results were primarily aided by an increase in net interest income (NII) and non-interest income, alongside lower non-interest expenses. Also, deposit and loan balances increased sequentially in the quarter. However, higher provisions were a headwind. The quarterly results excluded certain notable items. After considering the same, net income available to common shareholders was $293.1 million or $2.10 per share, up from $239 million or $1.69 per share in the prior-year quarter. For 2024, adjusted EPS was $8.30, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.38. Also, the bottom line declined 2.8% from the previous year\u2019s level. Net income (GAAP) was $1.17 billion, up marginally from the 2023 level. Our estimate for the metric was $1.18 billion. EWBC\u2019s Revenues Rise, Expenses Fall Quarterly net revenues were $675.8 million, up 3.2% year over year. Moreover, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $654.3 million. Full-year revenues totaled $2.61 billion, up marginally year over year. The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.59 billion. NII amounted to $587.6 million, which increased 2.2% year over year. However, net interest margin (NIM) contracted 24 basis points (bps) to 3.24%. We expected NII and NIM to be $563.5 million and 3.22%, respectively. Total non-interest income was $88.2 million, up 10.3%. The improvement was driven by an increase in all the components except customer derivative revenues, lower net gains on sales of loans, lower net gains on AFS debt securities and a fall in other income. We had estimated non-interest income to be $85.8 million. Non-interest expenses totaled $250 million, down 14% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s level. The decline was mainly due to a significant fall in the deposit insurance premiums and regulatory assessments cost and amortization of tax credits and CRA investments. Our estimate for the same was $234 million. The efficiency ratio was 36.92%, down from 44.34% in the prior-year quarter. A decline in the efficiency ratio indicates an improvement in profitability. As of Dec. 31, 2024, net loans held for investment (HFI) were $53 billion, reflecting a roughly 1% rise sequentially. Total deposits increased 2.4% to $63.2 billion. Story Continues Credit Quality Deteriorates for East West Bancorp Annualized quarterly net charge-offs were 0.48% of average loans HFI, up 33 bps from the prior-year quarter\u2019s level. As of Dec. 31, 2024, non-performing assets amounted to $194.1 million, up 70.2% year over year. The provision for credit losses was $70 million, up 89.2% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s level. Our estimate for the same was $31.7 million. EWBC\u2019s Capital & Profitability Ratios Improve As of Dec. 31, 2024, the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.28%, up from 13.31% as of Dec. 31, 2023. The total risk-based capital ratio was 15.59%, up from 14.76% a year ago. At the end of the fourth quarter, the return on average assets was 1.55%, up from 1.37% as of Dec. 31, 2023. Return on average tangible equity was 16.07%, up from 15.26%. East West Bancorp\u2019s Share Repurchase Update In the reported quarter, East West Bancorp repurchased roughly 0.2 million shares for $20 million. On Jan. 22, 2025, EWBC announced an additional authorization of up to $300 million, increasing the total authorization available to $329 million. Our View on EWBC East West Bancorp is well-poised for organic growth on continued improvement in loan and deposit balances, relatively higher interest rates and diversified fee income streams. However, a rise in expenses and a weak asset quality amid a tough operating backdrop are likely to hurt the bottom line. East West Bancorp, Inc.

Q & A Highlights Q : Can you provide more details on the fee income initiatives and their impact on the 2025 guidance? A : Vincent Delie, CEO, explained that some investments have already been recognized in expenses.

Story Continues Q : What are the primary drivers of the expected expense growth in 2025, and are there plans to reduce this growth rate in 2026?

FNB further strengthened its liquidity and capital position, improving the loan-to-deposit ratio over 500 basis points from the peak in 2024 through strong deposit originations and achieving higher capital ratios with a record CET1 ratio of 10.6%. Tangible book value per share (non-GAAP) grew 11% year-over-year, to a record $10.49 and operating return on average tangible common equity (non-GAAP) equaled 14.5% for the full year,\" said F.N.B. Corporation Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Vincent J. Delie, Jr. \"FNB benefited from its geographic footprint, investments in technology, strong balance sheet and high caliber front-line bankers to generate year-over-year loan growth of 5.0% and robust deposit growth of 6.9%. We also achieved record full-year\u00a0operating non-interest income (non-GAAP)\u00a0of $350 million , demonstrating the impact of our diversified business model and robust suite of products and services. Our credit metrics ended the year at solid levels in a changing economic environment with total delinquencies at 0.83% and net charge-offs at 0.19% for the full year. These results highlight the many significant milestones and records FNB achieved to drive shareholder value in 2024. We will continue to build on our momentum in 2025 with our expectation for strong revenue growth and a return to positive operating leverage.\" Story Continues Fourth Quarter 2024 Highlights (All comparisons refer to the fourth quarter of 2023, except as noted) Period-end total loans and leases increased $1.6 billion , or 5.0%. Consumer loans increased $949.0 million , or 8.0%, even with a $431 million indirect auto loan sale that closed in September 2024 , and commercial loans and leases increased $667.2 million , or 3.3%. FNB's loan growth was driven by the continued success of our strategy to grow high-quality loans and deepen customer relationships across our diverse geographic footprint. On a linked-quarter basis, period-end total loans and leases increased $221.0 million , or 0.7%, with an increase in consumer loans of $239.8 million , partially offset by a slight decrease in commercial loans and leases of $18.2 million . Period-end total deposits increased $2.4 billion , or 6.9%, driven by an increase of $1.9 billion in interest-bearing demand deposits and $1.3 billion in shorter-term time deposits, offsetting the decline of $461.3 million in non-interest-bearing demand deposits and $286.7 million in savings deposits, as customers continued to opt for higher-yielding deposit products. On a linked-quarter basis, period-end total deposits increased $336.2 million , or 0.9%, with increases in interest-bearing demand deposits of $669.1 million more than offsetting the decline in shorter-term time deposits of $170.7 million , non-interest-bearing demand deposits of $109.4 million and savings deposits of $52.8 million . The ratio of non-interest-bearing demand deposits to total deposits was 26% at December 31, 2024 , compared to 27% at the prior quarter end, reflecting the strong interest-bearing deposit growth and stable non-interest-bearing demand deposit balances. The loan-to-deposit ratio was 91% at December 31, 2024 , compared to 92% at September 30, 2024 , and 93% at December 31, 2023 . In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company recognized renewable energy investment tax credits of $28.4 million as a benefit to income taxes from a solar project financing transaction. A related non-credit valuation impairment of $10.4 million (pre-tax) was recognized on the financing receivable in other non-interest expense. In November 2024 , the Company completed the sale of $231 million in available-for-sale (AFS) investment securities yielding 1.41% as part of a balance sheet restructuring. The sale resulted in a realized loss (pre-tax) of $34.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. We reinvested proceeds from the sale into investment securities yielding 4.78% with a similar duration and convexity profile. In December 2024 , the Company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate / floating rate senior notes maturing in December 2030 . The senior notes bear interest at 5.722% per annum until December 11, 2029 . Starting on December 11, 2029 , the senior notes will bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to compounded SOFR plus 1.93%. The new debt will be used for general corporate purposes and serve as a replacement for $450 million of senior and subordinated note maturities occurring in 2025. Net interest income totaled $322.2 million , a slight decrease of $1.1 million , or 0.3%, from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower earning asset yields driven by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) rate cuts in the third and fourth quarters of 2024. During the fourth quarter of 2024, the FOMC lowered the target federal funds rate by a total of 50 basis points, bringing the year-to-date decrease to 100 basis points. Net interest margin (FTE) (non-GAAP) equaled 3.04%, a 4 basis point decline from the prior quarter, reflecting a 17 basis point decline in the total yield on earning assets (non-GAAP) and a 14 basis point decline in the total cost of funds. Non-interest income of $50.9 million included a $34.0 million realized loss (pre-tax) on the previously mentioned securities restructuring. The realized loss represents the fourth quarter 2024 significant item impacting earnings. Operating non-interest income (non-GAAP) totaled $84.9 million . Provision for credit losses was $22.3 million , a decrease of $1.2 million from the prior quarter with net charge-offs of $20.6 million down slightly compared to $21.5 million in the prior quarter. The ratio of non-performing loans and other real estate owned (OREO) to total loans and leases and OREO increased 9 basis points from the prior quarter to 0.48%, and total delinquency increased 4 basis points from the prior quarter to 0.83%. Overall, asset quality metrics continue to remain at solid levels. The CET1 regulatory capital ratio was 10.6% (estimated), compared to 10.0% at December 31, 2023 , and 10.4% at September 30, 2024 . Tangible book value per common share (non-GAAP) of $10.49 increased $1.02 , or 10.8%, compared to December 31, 2023 , and $0.16 , or 1.5%, compared to September 30, 2024 . Accumulated other comprehensive income/loss (AOCI) reduced the tangible book value per common share (non-GAAP) by $0.47 as of December 31, 2024 , primarily due to the impact of quarter-end interest rates on the fair value of AFS securities, compared to a reduction of $0.65 as of December 31, 2023 , and $0.43 as of September 30, 2024 . Tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio (non-GAAP) totaled 8.2%, compared to 7.8% at December 31, 2023 , and 8.2% at September 30, 2024 .

(b) Estimated for 4Q24. Fourth Quarter 2024 Results \u2013 Comparison to Prior-Year Quarter (All comparisons refer to the fourth quarter of 2023, except as noted) Net interest income totaled $322.2 million , a slight decrease of $1.8 million , or 0.6%, reflecting higher deposit costs resulting from balance growth in higher yielding deposit products, partially offset by growth in earning assets and\u00a0higher yields on investment securities. The net interest margin (FTE) (non-GAAP) decreased 17 basis points to 3.04%. The yield on earning assets (non-GAAP) increased 9 basis points to 5.34% driven by a 65 basis point increase in yields on investment securities to 3.52%, which benefited from balance sheet restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2024, offsetting a 3 basis point decline in yields on loans to 5.79%. Total cost of funds increased 28 basis points to 2.42% with a 35 basis point increase in interest-bearing deposit costs to 3.00% and an increase of 21 basis points in total borrowing costs. Average loans and leases totaled $33.8 billion , an increase of $1.6 billion , or 4.8%, including growth of $946.0 million in commercial loans and leases and $616.9 million in consumer loans. Commercial real estate increased $793.9 million , or 6.6%, commercial leases increased $74.8 million , or 11.6%, and commercial and industrial loans increased $73.4 million , or 1.0%. The increase in average commercial loans and leases was driven by activity across the footprint, including the Cleveland , Harrisburg and eastern North Carolina markets. The increase in commercial real estate included fundings on previously originated construction projects. The increase in average consumer loans included a $1.4 billion increase in residential mortgages largely due to the continued successful execution in key markets by our expanded mortgage banker team and long-standing strategy of serving the purchase market. Average indirect auto loans decreased $748.2 million , reflecting sales of $332 million and $431 million of such loans that closed in the first and third quarters of 2024, respectively, partially offset by new organic growth in the portfolio. Average deposits totaled $37.0 billion , an increase of $2.5 billion , or 7.4%, from the prior-year quarter. The growth in average time deposits of $1 .7\u00a0billion and average interest-bearing demand deposits of $1 .7\u00a0billion more than offset the decline in average non-interest-bearing demand deposits of $560 .8\u00a0million and average savings deposits of $324 .6\u00a0million as customers continued to migrate balances into higher-yielding products. The funding mix has slightly shifted compared to the year-ago quarter with non-interest-bearing demand deposits comprising 26% of total deposits at December\u00a031, 2024, compared to 29% a year ago. The loan-to-deposit ratio was 91% at December\u00a031, 2024, compared to 93% at December 31, 2023 . Non-interest income totaled $50.9 million , compared to $13.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. When adjusting for significant items of $34.0 million 1 in the fourth quarter of 2024 and $67.4 million 2 in the fourth quarter of 2023, operating non-interest income (non-GAAP) increased 5.6% to $84.9 million . Service charges increased $3.2 million , or 16.2%, primarily due to strong Treasury Management activity and higher consumer transaction volumes. Wealth Management revenues increased $1.1 million , or 6.1%, as trust income and securities commissions and fees increased 7.8% and 3.6%, respectively, through continued strong contributions across the geographic footprint. Non-interest expense totaled $248.2 million , decreasing $17.4 million , or 6.5%. When adjusting for $46.6 million 3 of significant items in the fourth quarter of 2023, operating non-interest expense (non-GAAP) increased $29.3 million , or 13.4%. Salaries and employee benefits increased $13.9 million , or 12.1%, primarily from elevated employer-paid healthcare costs and normal annual merit increases, as well as strategic hiring associated with our efforts to grow market share and continued investments in our risk management infrastructure, partially offset by lower production and performance-related variable compensation. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company also recognized a financing receivable non-credit impairment of $10.4 million (pre-tax) from a renewable energy investment tax credit transaction. The related renewable energy investment tax credits were recognized during the quarter as a benefit to income taxes. Outside services increased $2.5 million , or 10.8%, due to higher volume-related technology and third-party costs associated with ongoing investments in our enterprise risk management framework. The ratio of non-performing loans and OREO to total loans and OREO increased 14 basis points to 0.48%. Total delinquency increased 13 basis points to 0.83%, compared to 0.70% at December\u00a031, 2023. Overall, asset quality metrics continue to remain at solid levels. The provision for credit losses was $22.3 million , compared to $13.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The fourth quarter of 2024 reflected net charge-offs of $20.6 million , or 0.24% annualized of total average loans, compared to $8.2 million , or 0.10% annualized. The allowance for credit losses (ACL) was $422.8 million , an increase of $17.2 million , with the ratio of the ACL to total loans and leases stable at 1.25%. The effective tax rate was (7.0)%, compared to 13.1% in the fourth quarter of 2023, reflecting the impact of the previously mentioned significant items impacting earnings as well as renewable energy investment tax credits recognized as part of solar project financing transactions. The CET1 regulatory capital ratio was 10.6% (estimated) at December\u00a031, 2024, and 10.0% at December\u00a031, 2023. Tangible book value per common share (non-GAAP) was $10.49 at December\u00a031, 2024, an increase of $1.02 , or 10.8%, from $9.47 at December\u00a031, 2023. AOCI reduced the current quarter tangible book value per common share (non-GAAP) by $0.47 , compared to a reduction of $0.65 at the end of the year-ago quarter. 1 Fourth quarter 2024 non-interest income significant items impacting earnings included a $34.0 million (pre-tax) realized loss on the sale of investment securities. 2 Fourth quarter 2023 non-interest income significant items impacting earnings included a $67.4 million (pre-tax) realized loss on the sale of investment securities. 3 Fourth quarter 2023 non-interest expense significant items impacting earnings included a $29.9 million (pre-tax) FDIC special assessment and a $16.7 million (pre-tax) valuation allowance on auto loans held-for-sale. Fourth Quarter 2024 Results \u2013 Comparison to Prior Quarter (All comparisons refer to the third quarter of 2024, except as noted) Net\u00a0interest income totaled $322.2 million , a slight decrease of $1 .1\u00a0million, or 0.3%, from the prior quarter total of $323.3 million , reflecting lower earning asset yields, partially offset by the lower cost of interest-bearing deposits and the favorable mix-shift in interest-bearing liabilities. The total yield on earning assets (non-GAAP) decreased 17 basis points to 5.34% reflecting the impact of the FOMC interest rate cuts on loan yields offset by higher yields on investment security purchases as a result of monthly cash flows and the securities restructuring\u00a0that occurred in the fourth quarter. The total cost of funds decreased 14 basis points to 2.42%, as the cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased 8 basis points to 3.00% and long-term borrowing costs decreased 20 basis points to 5.04%, inclusive of the December 2024 offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in 2030. Period-end total borrowings were $4.3 billion , an increase of\u00a0$191.0 million, or 4.7%, from the prior quarter, reflecting the senior note offering, partially offset by payoffs funded by deposit growth. The resulting net interest margin (FTE) (non-GAAP) decreased 4 basis points\u00a0to 3.04%. Our total cumulative spot deposit beta since the FOMC interest rate cuts began in September 2024 equaled 16% at December 31, 2024 . Average loans and leases totaled $33.8 billion , an increase of $27.7 million , or 0.1%, as average commercial loans and leases increased $16.2 million , or 0.1%, and average consumer loans increased $11.5 million , or 0.1%. The increase in average commercial loans and leases included growth of $29.0 million , or 4.2%, in commercial leases. For consumer lending, average residential mortgages increased $271 .2\u00a0million, offsetting the average indirect auto loans decrease of $280 .5\u00a0million from the sale of $431 million that closed in September of 2024. Average deposits totaled $37.0 billion , increasing $1.4 billion , or 3.8%, due to organic growth in new and existing customer relationships through our successful deposit initiatives. Increases in average interest-bearing-demand deposits of $1 .2\u00a0billion and average time\u00a0deposits of $293.6 million were partially offset by declines in average savings balances of $74 .8\u00a0million, resulting from customers' preferences for higher-yielding deposit products. Average non-interest-bearing deposit balances were stable at $9 .9\u00a0billion. The mix of non-interest-bearing demand deposits to total deposits was 26% at December\u00a031, 2024, a slight decline from 27% at September\u00a030, 2024, driven by the strong growth in interest-bearing deposit balances. The loan-to-deposit ratio was 91% at December\u00a031, 2024, compared to 92% at September 30, 2024 . Non-interest income totaled $50.9 million , a decrease of $38.8 million , or 43.2%, from the prior quarter. When adjusting for a $34.0 million 4 significant item in the fourth quarter of 2024, operating non-interest income (non-GAAP) totaled $84.9 million , a 5.3% decrease from the record level in the prior quarter. Mortgage banking operations income increased $1.4 million , or 25.8%. Included in mortgage banking operations income was a $2.7 million mortgage servicing rights (MSR) net valuation recovery in the fourth quarter, compared to a $2.8 million net MSR impairment in the third quarter, offset by lower gain-on-sale margins given the sharp increase in mortgage rates during the fourth quarter. Capital markets income totaled $6.6 million , an increase of $0.4 million , or 6.1%, led by broad-based contributions from syndications, debt capital markets, customer swap activity and international banking. Bank-owned life insurance decreased $3.0 million , due to elevated life insurance claims in the prior quarter. Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings declined and the FHLB dividend rate was reduced resulting in a $1.2 million , or 17.7%, decrease in dividends on non-marketable equity securities. Non-interest expense totaled $248.2 million , compared to $249.4 million in the prior quarter. When adjusting for significant items of $15.3 million 5 in the third quarter of 2024, non-interest expense increased $14.0 million , or 6.0%, on an operating basis (non-GAAP). Salaries and employee benefits increased $1.9 million , primarily due to elevated employer-paid healthcare costs, partially offset by lower production and performance-related variable compensation. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company also recognized a financing receivable non-credit impairment of $10.4 million (pre-tax) from a renewable energy investment tax credit transaction. The related renewable energy investment tax credits were recognized during the quarter as a benefit to income taxes. Outside services increased $1.3 million , or 5.2%, largely due to higher volume-related technology and third-party costs associated with ongoing investments in the enterprise risk management framework. Bank shares and franchise tax expense decreased $2.3 million , or 59.1%, from charitable contributions that qualified for Pennsylvania bank shares tax credits. The efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) totaled 56.9%, compared to 55.2% for the prior quarter. The ratio of non-performing loans and OREO to total loans and OREO increased 9 basis points to 0.48%, and delinquency increased 4 basis points to 0.83%. Overall, asset quality metrics continue to remain at solid levels. The provision for credit losses was $22.3 million , compared to $23.4 million . The fourth quarter of 2024 reflected net charge-offs of $20.6 million , or 0.24% annualized of total average loans, compared to $21.5 million , or 0.25% annualized. The ACL was $422.8 million , an increase of $2.6 million , with the ratio of the ACL to total loans and leases stable at 1.25%. The effective tax rate was (7.0)%, compared to 21.4%, with the current quarter rate favorably impacted by renewable energy investment tax credits recognized as part of a solar project financing transaction. The CET1 regulatory capital ratio was 10.6% (estimated), compared to 10.4% at September\u00a030, 2024. Tangible book value per common share (non-GAAP) was $10.49 at December\u00a031, 2024, an increase of $0.16 per share. AOCI reduced the current quarter-end tangible book value per common share (non-GAAP) by $0.47 , compared to a reduction of $0.43 at the end of the prior quarter. 4 Fourth quarter 2024 non-interest income significant items impacting earnings included a $34.0 million (pre-tax) realized loss on the sale of investment securities. 5 Third quarter 2024 non-interest expense significant items impacting earnings included an $11.6 million (pre-tax) loss related to indirect auto loan sale and a $3.7 million (pre-tax) software impairment. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Indicators To supplement our Consolidated Financial Statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as operating net income available to common stockholders, operating earnings per diluted common share, return on average tangible equity, return on average tangible common equity, operating return on average tangible common equity, return on average tangible assets, tangible book value per common share, the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, pre-provision net revenue (reported), operating pre-provision net revenue,\u00a0operating non-interest income, operating non-interest expense, efficiency ratio, and net interest margin (FTE) to provide information useful to investors in understanding our operating performance and trends, and to facilitate comparisons with the performance of our peers. Management uses these measures internally to assess and better understand our underlying business performance and trends related to core business activities. The non-GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators we use may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators other financial institutions use to assess their performance and trends. These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplemental in nature, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP operating measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included later in this release under the heading \"Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Indicators to GAAP.\" Management believes items such as merger expenses, FDIC special assessment, realized loss on investment securities restructuring, software impairment, loss related to indirect auto loan sales, preferred dividend at redemption and branch consolidation costs are not organic to running our operations and facilities. These items are considered significant items impacting earnings as they are deemed to be outside of ordinary banking activities. These costs are specific to each individual transaction and may vary significantly based on the size and complexity of the transaction. To facilitate peer comparisons of net interest margin and efficiency ratio, we use net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets (loans and investments) to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments (this adjustment is not permitted under GAAP).\u00a0Taxable-equivalent amounts for 2024 and 2023 were calculated using a federal statutory income tax rate of 21%. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information This document may contain statements regarding F.N.B. Corporation's outlook for earnings, revenues, expenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity levels and ratios, asset quality levels, financial position and other matters regarding or affecting our current or future business and operations. These statements can be considered \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve various assumptions, risks and uncertainties which can change over time. Actual results or future events may be different from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements and may not align with historical performance and events. As forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, caution should be exercised against placing undue reliance upon such statements. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as \"believe,\" \"plan,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"outlook,\" \"estimate,\" \"forecast,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"project,\" \"goal,\" and other similar words and expressions, and the negative thereof, but these terms are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. FNB's forward-looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties: Our business, financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business, regulatory, economic and political circumstances, including, but not limited to: (i) developments with respect to the U.S. and global financial markets; (ii) supervision, regulation, enforcement and other actions by several governmental agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Financial Stability Oversight Council, U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, U.S. Treasury Department, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Department of Housing and Urban Development, state attorney generals and other governmental agencies, whose actions may affect, among other things, our consumer and mortgage lending and deposit practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, annual FDIC insurance premium assessment, growth opportunities, money supply, market interest rates or otherwise affect business activities of the financial services industry; (iii) a slowing of the U.S. economy in general and regional and local economies within our market area; (iv) inflation concerns; (v) the impacts of tariffs or other trade policies of the U.S. or its global trading partners; and (vi) the sociopolitical environment in the United States . Business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through effective use of systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital management techniques, and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards. Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention, and on credit spreads, deposit gathering and product pricing, which can affect market share, loans, deposits and revenues. Our ability to anticipate, react quickly and continue to respond to technological changes and significant adverse industry and economic events can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands. Business and operating results can also be affected by difficult to predict uncertainties, such as widespread natural and other disasters, wars, pandemics, global events and geopolitical instability, including the Ukraine - Russia conflict and the potential for broader conflict in the Middle East , shortages of labor, supply chain disruptions and shipping delays, terrorist activities, system failures, security breaches, significant political events, cyber-attacks, international hostilities or other extraordinary events which are beyond FNB's control and may significantly impact the U.S. or global economy and financial markets generally, or us or our counterparties, customers or third-party vendors specifically. Our ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to us meeting or exceeding minimum capital levels. Our regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend upon, among other things, our financial performance, the scope and terms of capital regulations then in effect and management actions affecting the composition of our balance sheet. Historically we have grown our business in part through acquisitions, new strategic and business initiatives and new products. Potential risks and uncertainties include those presented by the nature of the business acquired, the strategic or business initiative or the new product, including in some cases those associated with our entry into new business lines or new geographic or other markets and risks resulting from our inexperience in those new areas, as well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, increased scrutiny associated with the regulatory approval process, other regulatory issues stemming from such acquisitions or new initiatives or product lines, the integration of the acquired businesses into us after closing or any failure to execute strategic, risk management or operational plans. Legal, regulatory and accounting developments could have an impact on our ability to operate and grow our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, and reputation. Reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding, and the ability to attract and retain talent. These developments could include: Policies and priorities of the incoming U.S. presidential administration, including new legislative and regulatory reforms, more aggressive approaches to supervisory or enforcement priorities with consumer and anti-discrimination lending laws by the federal banking regulatory agencies and the DOJ, changes affecting oversight of the financial services industry, regulatory obligations or restrictions, consumer protection, taxes, employee benefits, compensation practices, pension, bankruptcy and other industry aspects, and changes in accounting policies and principles. Ability to continue to attract, develop and retain key talent. Changes to laws and regulations, including changes affecting the oversight of the financial services industry along with changes in enforcement and interpretation of such laws and regulations, and changes to accounting standards governing bank capital requirements, loan loss reserves and liquidity standards. Changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies, including interest rate policies and strategies of the Federal Open Market Committee. Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or inquiries. These matters may result in monetary judgments or settlements, enforcement actions or other remedies, including fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in our business practices, including financial and other types of commitments, and in additional expenses and collateral costs, and may cause reputational harm to us. Results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements imposed by the federal bank regulatory agencies or other governmental agencies. Business and operating results that are affected by our ability to effectively identify and manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through effective use of policies, processes, systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital and liquidity management techniques. The impact on our financial condition, results of operations, financial disclosures and future business strategies related to the impact on the allowance for credit losses due to changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions as a result of applying the \"current expected credit loss\" accounting standard, or CECL. A failure or disruption in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, including as a result of cyber-attacks or campaigns. Increased funding costs and market volatility due to market illiquidity and competition for funding. FNB cautions\u00a0that the risks identified here are not exhaustive of the types of risks that may adversely impact\u00a0FNB and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of these risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risk factors and other uncertainties described under Item 1A.

Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 8, 2025, 7:25 PM 5 min read In This Article: SNV -2.39% FNB -2.49% Synovus Financial Corp . SNV shares have gained 31.5% in the past six months, outperforming the industry\u2019s growth of 19.7%. The stock has also outperformed its close peers like Hancock Whitney Corporation HWC and F.N.B. Corporation FNB in the same time frame. Six-Month Price Performance Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research After such a strong rally, investors are left wondering whether they should buy SNV stock now or wait for a better entry point. Let us find out. What\u2019s Aiding SNV\u2019s Performance? Positive Impact of Fed\u2019s Rate Cuts : The Federal Reserve lowered the interest rates by 100 basis points since September 2024. The fed fund rates are now in the 4.25-4.5% range. Also, the central bank hinted at two more rate cuts this year. The rate cut is a positive development for SNV, which is under increased funding cost pressures. During the nine months of 2024, NII declined 6.2% from the same period a year ago. NIM declined to 3.16% in the first nine months of 2024 from 3.25% in the same period of 2023. With a decline in interest rates, funding costs will stabilize and decline eventually. This will support Synovus\u2019 NII and NIM growth in the upcoming period. Technological and Digital Advancement : Synovus is making progress in technology and digital advancement to enhance its financial services and expand its capabilities. In December 2024, SNV launched Accelerate Trade to support its international business clients by streamlining global trade finance processes. This platform, developed in collaboration with fintech provider Finzly, offers comprehensive visibility into international transactions and integrates essential tools, such as letters of credit, documentary collections, export and import financing, and bank guarantees. Additionally, Synovus extended its collaboration with Sagent in October 2023 to enhance mortgage loan servicing through real-time, cloud-based solutions. In April 2022, SNV acquired a 60% stake in Qualpay, reinforcing its payment processing capabilities and enabling seamless integration of financial services for merchants and software vendors. These initiatives highlight the bank\u2019s focus on leveraging technology to improve efficiency, enhance client experience and expand its footprint in international banking and fintech-driven services. Decent Balance Sheet : The bank has a decent liquidity position. Its cash and cash equivalents were $1.85 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024. As of the same date, the bank didn\u2019t have any short-term borrowings. Its long-term debt was $2.02 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024. Thus, given the company\u2019s decent cash levels and access to debt markets, it is expected to continue meeting debt obligations, even if the economic situation worsens. Strong Capital Position Aids Capital Distribution : As of Sept. 30, 2024, Synovus\u2019 Common Equity Tier 1 ratio and the total risk-based capital ratio of 10.65% and 13.62%, respectively, were well above the regulatory requirements. The company has paid out a steady dividend of 38 cents per share since March 2023. The company raised its dividend three times in the past five years and has a payout ratio of 38%. The company authorized a new share repurchase program worth $300 million in January 2024. As of Sept. 30, 2024, approximately $79.4 million worth of buyback authorization remained available. Management expects to utilize the whole authorization in the upcoming quarter. Given its robust capital position, the company\u2019s capital-deployment activities seem sustainable and will boost investor confidence in the stock. Likewise, its peers FNB and HWC also have steady capital distribution plans. F.N.B Corp pays out a dividend of 12 cents per share while Hancock Whitney pays 40 cents per share. FNB and HWC have payout ratios of 34% and 31%, respectively. Story Continues Near-Term Concerns for Synovus Elevated Expenses : Despite certain cost-saving initiatives, including headcount reductions, Synovus has witnessed a rise in expenses. The non-interest expenses witnessed a CAGR of 5% over the last four years (ended 2023). Although the trend reversed in the first nine months of 2024, continued investments in talent, technological developments and infrastructure are expected to inflate expenses in the near term and limit its bottom-line expansion. Lower Mortgage Banking Income : Discouraging the performance of Synovus\u2019 mortgage banking business is another primary concern.

Year To Buy a House Caitlyn Moorhead Mon, Jan 6, 2025, 6:00 PM 7 min read Ridofranz / Getty Images/iStockphoto Real estate agents and mortgage lenders alike have strong opinions about when is the best time to buy a home. The housing market, though volatile at times, can have a certain predictability when it comes to a good time to buy based on home prices, closing costs, mortgage interest rates and more.

Read Next: Real Estate Agents Explain Why You Should Never Invest in These 7 Home Features If you are in the home searching or home buying process, not only do you need to save for a down payment, but you also have to think about your timing . Quick Take: Determining the Best Time To Buy a House When it comes to real estate, supply and demand are always paramount, but as the quietest time of year in most housing markets is mid-fall through mid-winter, with a good percentage fewer homes sold in the winter months than in the spring, it often makes it the best time to buy. Here are a few key takeaways: Because winter is the slowest time for home sales, it generally means it\u2019s one of the cheapest times to buy a house. This also means there are typically fewer buyers and less chance of competition or a bidding war. Because the volume of bids is lower, sellers may also be more willing to negotiate the price tag or closing costs. Lawrence Yun , chief economist for the National Association of Realtors said, \u201cThe winter months, especially from the week of Thanksgiving to mid-January.\u201d Depending on where you live or where you want to move to, your climate, both economic and actual can play a big part in the real estate roulette. Here is what experts have to say about the best time of year to buy a house. Best Time To Buy a House in the Midwest Staci Titsworth, former territory sales manager for PNC Mortgage in Pittsburgh and current division sales manager at F.N.B Corportation , said the summer months are popular times to sell, but buyers might find better deals if they wait until the winter. \u201cSellers are more likely to try to sell in the spring and summer because that is when the curb appeal is best for their home sale, so they tend to price their home accordingly,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the Midwest, there are fewer homebuyers in the winter, which means there could be a better likelihood you wouldn\u2019t get into a bidding battle with another potential buyer. This can be translated into lower \u2018showing activity.'\u201d Sellers can also be especially motivated during the winter months because empty houses cost a lot to run in regions where winters are harsh. \u201cHeating a vacant home is expensive, and carrying two housing payments along with utilities is a drain on the budget,\u201d said Titsworth. \u201cLet\u2019s also remember that driveway snow may require more frequent plowing than mowing the lawn in the growing months, which is another seller expense.\u201d Story Continues However, buyers looking to score a deal in the winter should keep their eyes open for potential problems with a house that has not been properly winterized. \u201cIn my personal experience, I didn\u2019t want my home to sit vacant through the winter months out of fear that a water pipe could break \u2014 this actually happened to me,\u201d added Titsworth. For You: 3 Best States To Buy Property in the Next 5 Years, According To Experts Best Time To Buy a House on the East Coast Spring is real estate season, with Zillow reporting that more homes are listed for sale between April and June than at any other time of year. In May and June, active listings doubled compared to December and January . This in-between season is especially popular on the East Coast, where winters are brutal in the North and the summer brings hurricanes and crushing heat in the South. \u201cMost sellers put their homes on the market in the spring \u2014 everyone is out and looking,\u201d said Janine Acquafredda, an award-winning associate real estate broker with Remax , who has sold more than $300 million worth of New York City real estate. \u201cAnd yes, while there are more properties to choose from, the best will go, and they will go high because they had multiple bidders driving the prices up.\u201d If you\u2019re willing to let the best ones go and focus on getting a great price instead, Acquafredda said waiting until the winter will get you the best deal. \u201cThe leftovers may have gotten lots of activity, but no bites,\u201d she said. \u201cBuyers may think, \u2018What\u2019s wrong with that property?\u2019 Sellers may think, \u2018Why didn\u2019t anyone want our property?\u2019 They are tired of the selling process by now, and in most cases, not looking forward to another winter season maintaining their property in the Northeast or in general. All of this will translate into buyers getting a better price for the property.\u201d Acquafredda also said the winter is better for buying a second home \u2014 especially ones near the water. \u201cThese second-market homes are typically used on weekends or in warmer weather, so the peak time for these homes to hit the market are the fall and winter seasons when homeowners are done enjoying the space and looking to unload ASAP,\u201d she said. \u201cThere tends to be lots of inventory and very few buyers . It\u2019s the perfect recipe of high supply and low demand that will enable a buyer to negotiate a lower purchase price and probably a closing just in time to enjoy their new vacation property.\u201d Best Time To Buy a House on the West Coast or in the South Unlike the rest of the country, the winter months are a great time to buy a house on the West Coast and in the South because of the great weather. \u201cI have come to the conclusion that the fall/winter time is the best time to purchase a home,\u201d said Tracey Hampson, a realtor with Realty One Group in Santa Clarita, California, who stressed her nearly two decades in the business. \u201cWe still have sunny days through the fall/winter time so it\u2019s easy to view homes. There is also no battling the cold weather while looking for a home.\u201d While housing inventory usually drops significantly in the Midwest and East Coast during the winter, it can stay fairly high in these parts of the country. \u201cThere isn\u2019t as much inventory as the spring/summer, but there\u2019s enough that the homebuyer has a choice,\u201d said Hampson. \u201cWith the lower, but still healthy inventory, buyers do get a better list price on homes because sellers realize there aren\u2019t as many buyers this time of year.\u201d Even though the dip in inventory is slight, it\u2019s still enough to motivate sellers to wiggle on their demands. \u201cThey take every offer more seriously and are far more willing to negotiate,\u201d said Hampson. \u201cSo, during the fall/winter time, you have buyers and sellers who are more serious and focused regarding the home-buying and selling process.\u201d Final Take To GO The bottom line is that the best time to buy a house for you may depend on larger factors than the season or the region, but if you do have wiggle room in your timeline the winter months seem to be the best time in general according to many real estate market experts. \u201cInventory may be lower, but there are so many fewer people house shopping that buyers can negotiate lower prices,\u201d said Brian Davis of Spark Rental . \u201cIn other words, even though supply drops in the fall and winter months, demand drops even more. It should be no surprise that no one wants to buy a new home during the holidays. \u201cMost people instinctively start nesting as the weather cools and turn inward to hunker down with their families. Parents focus on holiday shopping and plans and prepare for winter \u2018hibernation.'\u201d This is what makes winter the perfect time for buyers to strike, according to Davis. \u201cSellers often want to close the old chapter of their lives before the year ends, both for tax and psychological reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cSellers are generally more amenable to lowball offers if buyers can settle quickly before the end of the year.\u201d \u201cService personnel are also more eager in the leaner winter months. Realtors and mortgage brokers are paid on commission, so they will bend further to make each deal happen during their slow season,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll also have more time to focus on each deal.\u201d Morgan Quinn and Andrew Lisa contributed to the reporting for this article.

FNB Headquarters a Cornerstone For One Of the Largest, Most Socially Responsible Development Projects in the U.S. PITTSBURGH , Dec. 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0FNB Financial Center, the new Pittsburgh -based corporate headquarters for F.N.B. Corporation (NYSE: FNB), was recently certified LEED Gold by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) . LEED, the world's most widely used green building rating system, provides a framework for energy-efficient, sustainable design, construction and operations. Projects achieve certification by following prerequisites and earning credits related to green building, with the aim to protect resources and enhance individual human health and community quality of life, among other goals. The majority of FNB's Pittsburgh -based corporate employees moved to the new building in late November. Consolidating several offices, subsidiaries and support departments under one roof creates opportunities for continued efficiency, collaboration and productivity improvements. Further amenities aimed at employee wellness and convenience include a fitness center, tenant-only terrace, floor-to-ceiling windows for substantial natural light, on-site\u00a0FNB branch, grab-and-go caf\u00e9 and retail space. FNB's move marked another milestone in its commitment to Pittsburgh's Lower Hill District neighborhood, a long-underserved area that is now home to one of the largest, most socially responsible urban development projects in the country. FNB worked closely with the development team, which includes the Buccini Pollin Group and the Pittsburgh Penguins, to ensure that the construction of FNB Financial Center achieved its high goals for participation by minority- and women-owned businesses (30 percent and 15 percent, respectively). In addition to investing in funds that contribute equity to minority-owned firms, FNB also created a loan program to provide local contractors with the resources necessary to participate in the development. \"Having a positive impact on our employees and the Hill District community, while reducing our impact on the environment, was a strategic goal for our new headquarters, and the expertise of our partners made that goal a success,\" said Vincent J. Delie, Jr. , Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of F.N.B. Corporation and First National Bank. \"After years of planning, we are thrilled to have our team members filling the building and enjoying a workspace that further enhances our outstanding culture.\" FNB Financial Center adds to FNB's companywide sustainability initiatives. Efficient HVAC and lighting systems have been installed at branches and offices throughout FNB's footprint, and multiple regional headquarters are in LEED-certified buildings, such as FNB's towers in Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina . Continua a leggere Advantus Engineering, a women-owned firm based in the Pittsburgh region, led the green design effort for FNB Financial Center. Environmentally conscious building materials, state-of-the-art HVAC and air filtration systems, efficient lighting, easy access to public transportation and electric charging stations are among many features supporting the building's Gold certification, the second highest tier of the LEED system.
