Logo (CNW Group/Newport Exploration Ltd.) Production Highlights of the second quarter production from the Western Flank as reported by Beach are as follows: Production from the Western Flank was 626 kboe, 6% below the prior quarter ( Note : Western Flank includes the Company's GOR licences ex PEL's 91, 106, 107 and PRL 26, as well as licences ex PEL's 92, 104 and 111, over which the Company does not have a GOR), mainly due to natural field decline which was partially mitigated through strong reservoir performance, high facility uptime and ongoing optimization activities. Western Flank oil production of 455 kbbl was 7% below the prior quarter. Gas and gas liquids production of 171 kboe was 3% below the prior quarter. The Company will update shareholders as soon as it is in receipt of any specific production forecasts for the GOR licences.

There is no time limit or expiry date on the GOR assets, and no cost to the Company to retain them. Newport has no control over operating decisions made by Beach. Accordingly, this prevents the Company from commenting on Beach's operating plans going forward. The Company recommends that shareholders and potential investors access material information relevant to the Company as released independently by Beach and Santos Ltd in order to keep current during exploration, development and potential production of all the licences subject to the Company's GOR. The Company receives its GOR from Beach, which is not a reporting issuer in Canada , therefore Newport is not able to confirm if the disclosure satisfies the requirements of NI 51-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities, or other requirements of Canadian securities legislation.

read Texas launch follows significant success in California with over 25% of CA pediatricians now referring patients to Clarity SAN FRANCISCO, January 23, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Clarity Pediatrics , the company transforming the pediatric specialty care journey with an innovative new care model, now offers comprehensive ADHD care to families with children ages 5-17 across the state of Texas. This expansion follows strong momentum in 2024, a year marked by a $10M seed round, recognition as a Digital Health Hub Foundation's Kids Health Rising Star, and inclusion in Rock Health's Top 50 in Digital Health. Since its launch in 2022, the company has established a significant California presence, with referrals from over 1,500 pediatricians \u2013 more than 25% of the state's pediatric providers \u2013 including all major health systems. The traditional pediatric care model has reached an inflection point, with over 40% of school-aged children and adolescents managing at least one chronic condition such as asthma, obesity, or behavior/learning problems. A severe \"Specialty Care Gap\" has emerged as demand for specialists vastly outpaces availability. Compounded by limited insurance coverage and lengthy wait times, millions of children are left without critical treatment. Clarity Pediatrics addresses this problem head-on through an innovative model combining personalized support, expert multi-specialty care teams, and convenient telehealth appointments \u2013 all covered by insurance. \"Our healthcare system is at a breaking point, and our kids are the ones paying the price. At Clarity Pediatrics, we\u2019ve built a new clinical model that brings the best of evidence-based specialty care into every home,\" said Dr. Alesandro Larrazabal, co-founder and Chief Medical Officer at Clarity Pediatrics. \"We\u2019re focusing on ADHD care first because the need is so substantial and urgent: 7 million children in the U.S. have been diagnosed, with diagnoses increasing by over 40% in recent years. We\u2019re proud to now serve families in Texas, and we\u2019re aggressively planning for both more states and additional chronic condition care in the very near future.\" Clarity Pediatrics\u2019 clinical care model uniquely delivers: Guideline-based coordinated care: All of Clarity\u2019s personalized treatment plans and clinical programs are evidence-based, designed in accordance with American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines. Clarity\u2019s tech-enabled model engages specialists, parents, and schools to improve outcomes and eliminate traditional barriers to care. Behavioral interventions: Behavioral Parent Training (BPT), the AAP's recommended first-line treatment for school-age ADHD, equips parents with science-backed skills to promote positive behaviors, strengthen parent-child relationships, and establish successful routines. Families can also access virtual group therapy programs focusing on emotion regulation, homework skills, and executive function. RUBI Parent Training: For families of children with ADHD and Autism Spectrum Disorder Level 1, Clarity offers RUBI Parent Training as a specialized alternative. RUBI teaches many of the same skills as BPT, but with additional consideration given to ASD-related behaviors. Medication management: Clarity\u2019s clinicians offer medication consultation and prescription management services (when appropriate) for FDA-approved stimulant medications. Families also receive counseling on lifestyle changes like diet, sleep, exercise, and screen time. Affordable in-network coverage: In Texas, Clarity accepts Optum (UnitedHealthcare), Evernorth (Cigna) and Aetna for behavioral health services, with expanded coverage coming soon. Clarity Pediatrics families covered by insurance paid an average co-pay per appointment of $25 in 2024. Patients not covered by insurance pay fair and transparent cash rates. Fast access to appointments: Traditional care models can leave families waiting up to a year for a specialist appointment. Clarity Pediatrics has no waitlist and most families meet with a Clarity clinician within weeks, with next-day appointments available in certain circumstances. Story Continues \"We\u2019re honored to be a trusted partner to parents and pediatricians, and to offer a specialty care model where everyone has access to the guidance and support their family needs,\" said Dr. Larrazabal. \"Our vision is to revolutionize pediatric specialty care through innovation and accessibility \u2013 and our Texas expansion marks an exciting milestone in that journey.\" Clarity Pediatrics plans to launch ADHD care in more states and expand its multi-specialty care model to other critical pediatric chronic conditions, including asthma, obesity, and allergies.

Platforms, Providing Opportunities to Better Serve Customers with a Broader Array of Energy and Sustainability Products Combines Nation\u2019s Premier Nuclear, Natural Gas and Geothermal Fleets to Create Cleanest and Most Reliable Energy Producer, with Coast-to-Coast Presence Immediately and Highly Accretive to Constellation\u2019s EPS and Cash Flow with Value Creation for Constellation Owners Ownership Commitment from Calpine\u2019s Owners, led by Energy Capital Partners (ECP), Who Will Receive Stock in the Pro Forma Company as Consideration Constellation to Host Conference Call and Webcast Today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time BALTIMORE & HOUSTON, January 10, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Constellation (Nasdaq: CEG) and Calpine Corp. today announced they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Constellation will acquire Calpine in a cash and stock transaction valued at an equity purchase price of approximately $16.4 billion, composed of 50 million shares of Constellation stock and $4.5 billion in cash plus the assumption of approximately $12.7 billion of Calpine net debt. After accounting for cash that is expected to be generated by Calpine between signing and the expected closing date, as well as the value of tax attributes at Calpine, the net purchase price is $26.6 billion, reflecting an attractive acquisition multiple of 7.9x 2026 EV/EBITDA. The agreement creates the nation\u2019s largest clean energy provider, opening opportunities to serve more customers coast-to-coast with a broader array of energy and sustainability products. Already the nation\u2019s largest producer of 24/7 emissions-free electricity, Constellation will add Calpine, the largest U.S. producer of energy from low-emission natural gas generation and an expanded renewable energy portfolio, including the largest geothermal generation operation in the U.S. The combination also forms the nation\u2019s leading competitive retail electric supplier, providing 2.5 million customers with a broader array of customized energy and sustainability solutions and new product offerings to help them manage energy costs and achieve their sustainability goals. \"This acquisition will help us better serve our customers across America, from families to businesses and utilities,\" said Joe Dominguez, president and CEO, Constellation. \"By combining Constellation\u2019s unmatched expertise in zero-emission nuclear energy with Calpine\u2019s industry-leading, best-in-class, low-carbon natural gas and geothermal generation fleets, we will be able to offer the broadest array of energy products and services available in the industry. Both companies have been at the forefront of America\u2019s transition to cleaner, more reliable and secure energy, and those shared values will guide us as we pursue investments in new and existing clean technologies to meet rising demand. What makes this combination even more special is it brings together two world-class teams, with the most talented women and men in the industry, who share a noble passion for safety, sustainability, operational excellence and helping America\u2019s families, businesses and communities thrive and grow. We look forward to welcoming the Calpine team upon closing of this transaction.\" Story Continues Calpine\u2019s low-emission natural gas plants will play a key role in maintaining grid reliability for decades to come as customers transition to cleaner energy sources. Both companies have been early investors in carbon sequestration technology to help ensure America\u2019s abundant natural gas can continue to reliably power customers. At the same time, Constellation will invest in adding more zero-emission energy to the grid by extending the life of existing clean energy sources, exploring new advanced nuclear projects, investing in renewables and increasing the output of existing nuclear plants, in addition to restarting the Crane Clean Energy Center in Pennsylvania. Andrew Novotny, president and CEO of Calpine, said, \"This is an incredible opportunity to bring together top tier generation fleets, leading retail customer businesses and the best people in our industry to help drive a stronger American economy for a cleaner, healthier and more sustainable future. Together, we will be better positioned to bring accelerated investment in everything from zero-emission nuclear to battery storage that will power our economy in a way that puts people and our environment first. It\u2019s a win for every American family and business in our newly combined footprint that wants clean and reliable energy. ECP\u2019s commitment to these goals over the last seven years was critical to the progress we have made as a company and to laying a foundation for future growth.\" Tyler Reeder, president & managing partner of ECP, said, \"Since acquiring Calpine in 2018, we have focused on unlocking value and driving future potential growth avenues for the business, which we believe have been recognized through this combination. We truly cannot thank the Calpine team enough for their partnership and are excited to support their continued contributions to the Constellation team. Following the closing of the transaction, we will remain committed as a shareholder of Constellation, reflecting our high confidence in the continued value and growth potential created by this combination.\" The transaction will deliver benefits to Constellation\u2019s owners, with expected immediate adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings per share (EPS) accretion of more than 20% in 2026 and at least $2 per share of EPS accretion in future years. The transaction is projected to add more than $2 billion (non-GAAP) of free cash flow annually, creating strategic capital and scale to reinvest in the business. Constellation\u2019s base earnings outlook is expected to continue growing at a double-digit rate through the decade. Constellation remains committed to a strong, investment-grade balance sheet with current ratings expected to be affirmed by S&P and Moody\u2019s. Strategic Benefits: Creates the cleanest and most reliable generation portfolio in the U.S., with a diverse, coast-to-coast portfolio of zero- and low-emission generation assets and expands Constellation\u2019s footprint in the fastest growing area of demand for power: Together, Constellation and Calpine will have nearly 60 gigawatts of capacity from zero- and low-emission sources, including nuclear, natural gas, geothermal, hydro, wind, solar, cogeneration and battery storage. The combined company\u2019s footprint will span the continental U.S. and include a significantly expanded presence in Texas, the fastest growing market for power demand, as well as other key strategic states, including California, Delaware, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Combines best-in-class retail and commercial businesses with a premier customer solutions platform, establishing a coast-to-coast presence and providing opportunities to serve more customers with a broader array of energy and sustainability products to meet increasing demand: The transaction will expand Constellation\u2019s industry-leading customer solutions business to position the combined company as the leading U.S. retail electricity supplier, helping 2.5 million homes and businesses nationwide achieve their energy and sustainability needs. The combined company will offer customers a broader array of reliable energy solutions, including new product offerings that can integrate nuclear, renewable and natural gas technologies tailored to customers\u2019 unique needs. Customers also will enjoy more predictability and competitive prices as a result of the two companies\u2019 complementary generation assets, load, fuel diversity, geographies and product offerings. Reinforces Constellation\u2019s position as the largest clean energy producer with the lowest carbon emissions intensity in the U.S.: Constellation is already the top clean energy producer in the U.S., providing 10% of the nation\u2019s emissions-free energy. Joining Calpine with Constellation broadens this position by increasing Constellation\u2019s renewable portfolio, including the Geysers facility in Northern California, the largest geothermal generator in the U.S. The combined company is poised for further growth, enhanced by its increased scale and cash flow. Joins proven, experienced, best-in-class teams with strong cultures of safety, operating excellence and commitment to serving customers, communities and the country. Constellation and Calpine\u2019s people share a passion for powering America\u2019s families and businesses with energy that is reliable, clean and available whenever it\u2019s needed. Both companies are innovators recognized across the industry for operating at the highest levels of safety, efficiency and reliability, and for offering competitive products that allow customers to cost-effectively meet their energy needs. After closing, Calpine CEO Andrew Novotny will bring his decades of energy expertise and leadership to Constellation and continue to lead the Calpine business. Strengthens shared commitment to supporting clean, healthy and growing communities through workforce development, philanthropy and community investment: Together, the combined company will increase its positive impact, serving as an economic engine for local communities through jobs, tax payments and other economic activity. The combined company will continue its commitment to communities through more than $21.1 million in combined annual Foundation, corporate and employee philanthropy, in addition to thousands of employee volunteer hours, with a focus on economically disadvantaged communities. Additional Transaction Details The cash and stock transaction will have a value of approximately $16.4 billion, composed of 50 million shares of Constellation stock using the trailing 20-day VWAP of $237.98 and $4.5 billion in cash plus the assumption of approximately $12.7 billion of Calpine net debt. Constellation expects to fund the cash portion of the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and cash flow generated by Calpine in the period between signing and closing of the transaction (that will be assumed at closing).

Business Wire Tue, Jan 7, 2025, 12:37 AM 7 min read In This Article: BPT -0.36% HOUSTON, January 06, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust Announces No Unit Payment for the Fourth Quarter of 2024, Termination of the Trust on December 31, 2024, Commencement of Winding-Up of the Trust, and Receipt of Notice From NYSE Regarding Non-Compliance With Continued Listing Standards BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust (NYSE: BPT) announced that Unit holders will not receive a dividend payment for the quarter ended December 31, 2024. The dividend information is as follows: Ex-Dividend Date: January 14, 2025 Record Date: January 15, 2025 Payable Date: None Dividend Rate: $0.00 per Unit As provided in the Trust Agreement, the quarterly royalty payment by Hilcorp North Slope, LLC (\"HNS\") to the Trust is the sum of the individual revenues attributed to the Trust as calculated each day during the quarter. The amount of revenue is determined by multiplying Royalty Production for each day in the calendar quarter by the Per Barrel Royalty for that day. Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the Per Barrel Royalty for any day is the WTI Price for the day less the sum of (i) Chargeable Costs multiplied by the Cost Adjustment Factor and (ii) Production Taxes. For the three months ended December 31, 2024, the Per Barrel Royalty was calculated based on the following information: Average WTI Price $ 70.32 Average Adjusted Chargeable Costs $ 91.10 Average Production Taxes $ 2.42 Average Per Barrel Royalty $ (23.19 ) Average Net Production (mb/d) 64.6 The average daily closing WTI price was below the \"break-even\" price for the quarter, resulting in a negative value for the payment calculation for the quarter. However, as provided in the Trust Agreement, the payment with respect to the Royalty Interest for any calendar quarter may not be less than zero. Termination of the Trust As previously disclosed, pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trust terminates when the net revenues from the Royalty Interest for two successive years are less than $1.0 million per year. The Trust has not received any revenues attributable to any of the four quarters of each of 2023 and 2024. Therefore, in accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trust terminated at 11:59 PM on December 31, 2024, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the \"Trustee\"), has commenced the process of winding up the affairs of the Trust. Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, upon the termination of the Trust, the Trustee is generally required to sell for cash all the assets of the Trust (other than cash). As soon as practical following termination of the Trust, the Trustee is required to obtain a third-party opinion as to the fair market value of the Trust assets on the date of termination. HNS has an option, exercisable within 30 days of the notice of the determination of the fair market value, to purchase the assets of the Trust at a price equal to the greater of (i) the fair market value of the Trust assets as set forth in the opinion, or (ii) $11,641,600, which represents 21,400,000 outstanding units of beneficial ownership (the \"Units\") as of December 31, 2024 multiplied by $0.544 (the closing price of the Units on the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") on December 31, 2024, the termination date of the Trust). Story Continues If HNS does not exercise its option within 30 days of receiving the fair market value opinion, the Trust Agreement requires the Trustee to sell the Trust assets on terms and conditions approved by the vote of holders of 60% of the outstanding Units, unless the Trustee determines that it is not practicable to submit the matter to a vote of the unitholders and the sale is made at a price at least equal to the fair market value of the Trust assets as set forth in the third-party opinion and on terms and conditions deemed commercially reasonable by that the third-party valuing the Trust assets. The Trustee is obligated to distribute the available net proceeds of any such sale to the Unit holders after satisfaction of all of the Trust\u2019s liabilities (including, without limitation, any expenses of the Trust) and establishing or increasing reserves for the payment of contingent liabilities of the Trust. Unitholders do not have the right under the Trust Agreement to seek or secure any partition or distribution of the Royalty Interest or any other asset of the Trust or any accounting during the term of the Trust or during any period of liquidation and winding up. The Trustee cannot predict when the wind-up of the Trust will be completed. Notice from NYSE regarding Non-Compliance with Continued Listing Standards The Trust also announced that on December 31, 2024, it received written notification (the \"Notice\") from the NYSE that as of December 30, 2024, the Trust no longer satisfied the continued listing compliance standards set forth under Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual because the average closing price of the Trust\u2019s units of beneficial interest (the \"Units\") was less than $1.00 over a 30 consecutive trading-day period. The Trust can regain compliance at any time during the six-month cure period if on the last trading day of any calendar month during the cure period the Trust has a closing Unit price of at least $1.00 and an average closing Unit price of at least $1.00 over the 30 trading-day period ending on the last trading day of that month. In the event that at the expiration of the six-month cure period, both a $1.00 closing share price on the last trading day of the cure period and a $1.00 average closing share price over the 30 trading-day period ending on the last trading day of the cure period are not attained, the NYSE will commence suspension and delisting procedures. Neither the Trust nor the Trustee has any control over the trading price of the Units, nor does the Trust have the authority to cause a reverse split of the units or to take similar action designed to affect the trading price of the Units without a vote of the unitholders. If the Trust were unable to regain compliance with the applicable standards within a six-month cure period, the NYSE will commence suspension and delisting procedures. Subject to the Trust\u2019s compliance with the other continued listing requirements, during any applicable cure period, the Units are expected to continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE under the symbol \"BPT\" but the NYSE makes available on the consolidated tape an indicator, \".BC\", when a company is below the NYSE\u2019s quantitative continued listing standards.

EBITDA represents earnings (losses) before interest income, interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation, and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) excluding net charges related to interest income, interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation, amortization, strategic consulting and other related professional fees, executive severance and employee retention, restructuring and restructuring-related expense, share-based compensation, (gain) loss on sale of long-lived assets, impairment of long-lived assets, unrealized foreign exchange (gains) losses, net, and other non-cash (gains) losses, net. The Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less additions to property and equipment, and defines Net Debt as the sum of total debt, excluding reductions for unamortized discounts and issuance costs, less cash and cash equivalents. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measurements to investors is useful, as these measures provide important supplemental information of our performance to investors and permit investors and management to evaluate the operating performance of our business. These measures provide useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding our operating results as they exclude certain items whose fluctuation from period-to-period do not necessarily correspond to changes in the operating results of our business. We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in internal forecasts and models when establishing internal operating budgets, supplementing the financial results and forecasts reported to our Board of Directors, determining a component of certain incentive compensation for executive officers and other key employees based on operating performance, determining compliance with certain covenants in the Company's credit facilities, and evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our core business. We use Free Cash Flow to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a useful measure of cash flows since purchases of property and equipment are a necessary component of ongoing operations, and similar to the use of Net Cash (Debt), assists management with its capital planning and financing considerations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures assist in providing an enhanced understanding of our underlying operational measures to manage our core businesses, to evaluate performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace, and to establish operational goals. Further, we believe that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in our financial and operational decision-making. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. Some of the limitations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA include: EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect historical capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. In addition, Net Debt assumes the Company's cash and cash equivalents can be used to reduce outstanding debt without restriction, while Free Cash Flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures and excludes the Company's remaining investing activities and financing activities, including the requirement for principal payments on the Company's outstanding indebtedness. See reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures included in the financial tables of this release. Net Operating Loss Carryforwards The Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \"Protective Amendment\") includes provisions designed to protect the tax benefits of the Company's net operating loss carryforwards by preventing certain transfers of our securities that could result in an \"ownership change\" (as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code). The Protective Amendment generally restricts any direct or indirect transfer if the effect would be to (i) increase the direct, indirect or constructive ownership of any stockholder from less than 4.99 percent to 4.99 percent or more of the shares of common stock then outstanding or (ii) increase the direct, indirect or constructive ownership of any stockholder owning or deemed to own 4.99 percent or more of the shares of common stock then outstanding. Pursuant to the Protective Amendment, any direct or indirect transfer attempted in violation of the Protective Amendment would be void as of the date of the prohibited transfer as to the purported transferee (or, in the case of an indirect transfer, the ownership of the direct owner of the shares would terminate simultaneously with the transfer), and the purported transferee (or in the case of any indirect transfer, the direct owner) would not be recognized as the owner of the shares owned in violation of the Protective Amendment (the \"excess stock\") for any purpose, including for purposes of voting and receiving dividends or other distributions in respect of such shares, or in the case of options, receiving shares in respect of their exercise. For further discussion of the Protective Amendment, please see the Company's filings with the SEC. Forward-Looking Statements This release contains forward-looking statements.

Its effectiveness in eliminating bacteria, viruses, and algae contributes to maintaining the safety and clarity of water. TCCA is available in various forms such as tablets, granules, or powder. It hence provides pool operators with convenient options for dosing appropriate amounts based on their specific requirements. When trichlor is introduced to pool water, it undergoes a chemical reaction upon contact with water. This reaction leads to the release of cyanuric acid and hypochlorous acid. Presence of hypochlorous acid is of utmost importance in pool water treatment. It serves as a key source of free chlorine, which is responsible for the chlorination process necessary to maintain the desired sanitation levels in pools. In this context, role of cyanuric acid is significant. One of the challenges faced in pool maintenance is the loss of chlorine due to evaporation caused by UV rays. Within a few hours of exposure to UV rays, chlorine levels in pool water can be reduced by up to 90%. This poses a significant challenge in maintaining effective disinfection. To address this issue, cyanuric acid serves as a stabilizer in pool water. It plays a crucial role in facilitating the formation of a more stable compound with chlorine, which exhibits enhanced resistance to degradation when exposed to UV rays. This stabilization effect helps to prolong the effectiveness of chlorine in the pool water, ensuring consistent disinfection. By preventing conversion of hypochlorous acid into hypochlorite ions, which have lower microbial activity, cyanuric acid helps maintain the effectiveness of chlorine in sanitizing pool water. This stabilization process ensures that the chlorine remains active for a longer duration, thereby optimizing its ability to combat bacteria and other contaminants present in the pool.

LSE:BPT Discounted Cash Flow as at Nov 2024 Phoenix Group Holdings Overview: Phoenix Group Holdings plc operates in the long-term savings and retirement business in Europe, with a market cap of \u00a34.94 billion. Operations: The company generates revenue from its key segments, including Retirement Solutions (\u00a32.01 billion), while experiencing negative contributions from With-profits (-\u00a31.56 billion), Europe & Other (-\u00a3891 million), and Pensions & Savings (-\u00a3418 million). Story Continues Estimated Discount To Fair Value: 19.9% Phoenix Group Holdings, trading at \u00a34.95, is undervalued relative to its estimated fair value of \u00a36.18, though not by a significant margin.

06, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Steel Connect, Inc. (the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: STCN) today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended July 31, 2024. Results of Operations Due to the previously disclosed application of pushdown accounting, the Company's consolidated financial statements include a black line division between the two distinct periods to indicate the application of two different bases of accounting, which may not be comparable, between the periods presented. The pre-exchange period through April 30, 2023, is referred to as the \"Predecessor\" period. The post-exchange period, May 1, 2023, and onward, includes the impact of pushdown accounting and is referred to as the \"Successor\" period. As it relates to the results of operations, while the Successor period and the Predecessor period are distinct reporting periods, the effects of the change of control for financial statement purposes did not have a material impact on the comparability of our results of operations between the periods, unless otherwise noted related to the impact from pushdown accounting.

This increase in net revenue was primarily driven by higher volumes, favorable pricing mix and new program starts associated with clients in the computing and consumer electronics markets. Net revenue for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 decreased by approximately $15.0 million, or 7.9%, as compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, primarily driven by lower volumes related to clients in the computing and consumer electronics markets, partially offset by new business revenue from new clients in the consumer electronics market. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue for the fourth quarter increased $3.5 million, or 11.6%, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a $2.5 million increase in materials procured on behalf of clients as a result of higher sales volume for clients in the computing and consumer electronics markets. Cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 decreased $12.2 million, or 8.8%, as compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, primarily due to a $12.6 million decrease in materials procured on behalf of clients in the computing and consumer electronics markets. Gross Profit The Company's gross profit increased by $1.6 million, or 14.5%, as compared to the same period in the prior year, and the Company's gross margin percentage increased by 50 basis points to 27.6%, as compared to 27.1% for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable pricing mix for clients in the computing and consumer electronics markets. The Company's gross profit decreased by $2.8 million, or 5.5%, for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 as compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 primarily due to lower sales volume discussed above. The gross profit percentage for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 increased 80 basis points to 27.9% from 27.1% for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, primarily due to changes in customer sales mix. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses for the fourth quarter increased $2.3 million, or 26.8%, as compared to the same period in the prior year. SG&A expenses for ModusLink Corporation (\"Supply Chain\") increased by $1.4 million due to partial recovery of previously reserved bad debt in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 that did not reoccur in the current year quarter and other miscellaneous expenses, none of which are individually significant. Corporate-level activity increased by $0.9 million, primarily driven by an increase in mergers and acquisition related expenses. SG&A expenses for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 decreased by approximately $4.5 million or 10.7%, as compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, primarily due to Corporate-level activity. Corporate-level activity decreased by $5.1 million, primarily due to a decrease in legal and other professional fees related to the Exchange Transaction which closed in May 2023. This activity was partially offset by an increase in mergers and acquisitions related expenses during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024. Amortization Expense Amortization expense is related to the recognition of intangible assets in connection with the application of pushdown accounting as a result of the Exchange Transaction, which closed on May 1, 2023. Amortization expense for the fourth quarter remained relatively flat as compared to the same period in the prior year. Amortization expense for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 increased $2.6 million or 290.1% as compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. The increase is due to a full years' worth of amortization being recognized for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024, as compared to only three months' worth of amortization recognized for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. Interest Expense Total interest expense for the fourth quarter remained relatively flat as compared to the same period in the prior year. Total interest expense for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 decreased $1.9 million or 65.1% as compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, primarily due to the cessation of the amortization of the discount on the 7.50% Senior Convertible Note due 2024 (the \"SPHG Note\") as of May 1, 2023, the date of the Exchange Transaction. Other Gains, Net (including Interest Income): Other gains, net for the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023 were approximately $5.8 million and $6.4 million. Other gains, net for the three months ended July 31, 2024 included: (1) $3.3 million interest income, primarily earned on money market funds; (2) $1.3 million grant income; and (3) $0.9 million net gains on investments. Other gains, net for the three months ended July 31, 2023 included: (1) $5.1 million realized gains on the disposition of the Aerojet shares received in the Exchange Transaction, and (2) $0.7 million of interest income received on money market funds. Other gains, net for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 and the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 were $14.5 million and $11.3 million, respectively. Other gains, net for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 included: (1) $13.7 million interest income, primarily earned on money market funds, (2) $1.4 million grant income, and (3) $0.4 million sublease income. This activity was partially offset by (1) $0.6 million net losses on investments and (2) $0.4 million net unrealized loss on the fair value remeasurement of the SPHG Note. Other gains, net for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 included: (1) $5.1 million realized gains on the disposition of the Aerojet shares received in the Exchange Transaction, (2) $2.3 million gain from proceeds received from the sale of an investment, (3) $1.6 million interest income, primarily earned on money market funds, (4) $1.4 million settlement with a client, and (5) $1.0 million sublease income. This activity was partially offset by $0.5 million unrealized loss on the fair value remeasurement of the SPHG Note. Income Tax Benefit (Expense) Income tax benefit for the fourth quarter was $0.1 million, as compared to $0.4 million for the same period in the prior year. The change in income tax benefit for the three months ended July 31, 2024 as compared to the prior year period was primarily due to the mix of earnings from our U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 was approximately $67.0 million, as compared to $1.2 million income tax expense for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. The favorable change in income tax is due to the Company's release of a portion of its valuation allowance for certain pre-existing Company deferred tax assets. The release resulted in a non-cash adjustment to income tax benefit of $73.4 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024, which increased from the income tax benefit of $71.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to an increase in taxable income that resulted in more NOLs being utilized before their expiration at fiscal year end. Net Income Net income for the fourth quarter decreased $1.6 million, or 19.8%, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in net income is primarily due to unfavorable changes within non-operating expenses, such as the decrease in other gains, net of $0.6 million and $0.3 million unfavorable change in income tax benefit. See above explanations for further details. Net income for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 increased $72.4 million, or 463.6%, as compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. The increase in net income is primarily due to the non-cash, significant income tax benefit accounting adjustment booked during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024. See above for further details. Additions to Property and Equipment (Capital Expenditures) Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter totaled $1.1 million, or 2.3% of net revenue, as compared to $0.8 million, or 2.0% of net revenue, for the same period in the prior year. Capital expenditures increased to $4.0 million, or 2.3% of net revenue for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024, from $2.1 million, or 1.1% of net revenue, for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA decreased $6.3 million, or 59.5%, for the fourth quarter as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher operating expenses of $3.6 million and lower realized gains of $3.4 million due to the $5.1 million gain on the disposition of the Aerojet shares received in the Exchange Transaction in the prior year period that did not reoccur in the current year quarter, partially offset by higher gross profit of $1.6 million. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $11.3 million, or 40.9%, for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024, as compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, primarily due to lower realized foreign exchange gains of $3.4 million, lower realized gains of $3.2 million due to the $5.1 million gain on the disposition of the Aerojet shares received in the Exchange Transaction in the prior year period that did not reoccur in the current year, and a $2.8 million decrease in gross profit driven by lower sales volume.

Measurements In addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company uses EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Net Debt, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures, to assess its performance. EBITDA represents earnings before interest income, interest expense, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization of intangible assets. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding net charges related to interest income, interest expense, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation, amortization, strategic consulting and other related professional fees, executive severance and employee retention, restructuring and restructuring-related expense, share-based compensation, loss (gain) on sale of long-lived assets, unrealized foreign exchange losses, net, and other non-cash gains, net. The Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property and equipment, and defines Net Debt as the sum of total debt, excluding reductions for unamortized discounts and issuance costs, less cash and cash equivalents. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measurements to investors is useful, as these measures provide important supplemental information of our performance to investors and permit investors and management to evaluate the operating performance of our business. These measures provide useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding our operating results as they exclude certain items whose fluctuation from period-to-period do not necessarily correspond to changes in the operating results of our business. We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in internal forecasts and models when establishing internal operating budgets, supplementing the financial results and forecasts reported to our Board of Directors, determining a component of certain incentive compensation for executive officers and other key employees based on operating performance, determining compliance with certain covenants in the Company's credit facilities, and evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our core business. We use Free Cash Flow to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a useful measure of cash flows since purchases of property and equipment are a necessary component of ongoing operations, and similar to the use of Net Debt, assists management with its capital planning and financing considerations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures assist in providing an enhanced understanding of our underlying operational measures to manage our core businesses, to evaluate performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace, and to establish operational goals. Further, we believe that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in our financial and operational decision-making. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies Some of the limitations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA include: EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect historical capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. In addition, Net Debt assumes the Company's cash and cash equivalents can be used to reduce outstanding debt without restriction, while Free Cash Flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures and excludes the Company's remaining investing activities and financing activities, including the requirement for principal payments on the Company's outstanding indebtedness. See reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures included in the financial tables of this release. Net Operating Loss Carryforwards The Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \"Protective Amendment\") includes provisions designed to protect the tax benefits of the Company's net operating loss carryforwards by preventing certain transfers of our securities that could result in an \"ownership change\" (as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code). The Protective Amendment generally restricts any direct or indirect transfer if the effect would be to (i) increase the direct, indirect or constructive ownership of any stockholder from less than 4.99 percent to 4.99 percent or more of the shares of common stock then outstanding or (ii) increase the direct, indirect or constructive ownership of any stockholder owning or deemed to own 4.99 percent or more of the shares of common stock then outstanding. Pursuant to the Protective Amendment, any direct or indirect transfer attempted in violation of the Protective Amendment would be void as of the date of the prohibited transfer as to the purported transferee (or, in the case of an indirect transfer, the ownership of the direct owner of the shares would terminate simultaneously with the transfer), and the purported transferee (or in the case of any indirect transfer, the direct owner) would not be recognized as the owner of the shares owned in violation of the Protective Amendment (the \"excess stock\") for any purpose, including for purposes of voting and receiving dividends or other distributions in respect of such shares, or in the case of options, receiving shares in respect of their exercise. For further discussion of the Protective Amendment, please see the Company's filings with the SEC.
