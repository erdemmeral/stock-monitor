DXPE, Photronics, Inc. PLAB, GigaCloud Technology Inc. GCT and Mission Produce, Inc. AVO. Look Beyond Profit: Bet on 4 Stocks with Increasing Cash Flows Crunching profit numbers and evaluating surprises might appear as a good option in the ongoing reporting cycle but these do not ensure that the profits are being efficiently channeled to the reserves for funding growth. This is because even a profit-making company can have a deficiency of cash flow and go bankrupt while meeting its obligations. Therefore, one must look at a company's proficiency in generating cash flows before investing in the right stocks. This is because cash is the most indispensable factor for any company. It gives strength and vitality and is the key to its existence, development and success. This view is particularly relevant in light of the ongoing global economic uncertainty, coupled with market disruptions and dislocations. In this regard, stocks like DXP Enterprises, Inc. , Photronics, Inc. , GigaCloud Technology Inc. and Mission Produce, Inc. are worth buying. To figure out this efficiency, one needs to consider a company's net cash flow. While in any business, cash moves in and out, it is net cash flow that explains how much money a company is actually generating. If a company is experiencing a positive cash flow, it denotes an increase in its liquid assets, which gives it the means to meet debt obligations, shell out for expenses, reinvest in the business, endure downturns and finally return wealth to shareholders. On the other hand, a negative cash flow indicates a decline in the company's liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves. However, having a positive cash flow merely does not secure a company's future growth. To ride on the growth curve, a company must have its cash flow increasing because that indicates management's efficiency in regulating its cash movements and less dependency on outside financing for running its business. Therefore, keep yourself abreast with the following screen to bet on stocks with rising cash flows. Here are four out of the 11 stocks that qualified for the screening: DXP Enterprises provides innovative pumping solutions, supply-chain services, and maintenance, repair, operating and production services.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Strong Momentum Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Zacks Equity Research Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 5:40 PM 2 min read In This Article: AVO -1.60% While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks, we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies. With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies. Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large. Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the \"Value\" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, \"A\" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today. One company value investors might notice is Mission Produce (AVO) . AVO is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) and an A for Value. AVO is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1.24. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. AVO's industry currently sports an average PEG of 1.29. Within the past year, AVO's PEG has been as high as 1.54 and as low as 0.93, with a median of 1.36. Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. AVO has a P/S ratio of 0.69. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.7. These are only a few of the key metrics included in Mission Produce's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, AVO looks like an impressive value stock at the moment. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

{"text": "Look Beyond Profit, Bet on 4 Stocks With Increasing Cash Flows Moumita C. Chattopadhyay Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 4:58 PM 5 min read In This Article: DXPE -3.10% Crunching profit numbers and evaluating surprises might appear as a good option in the ongoing reporting cycle but these do not ensure that the profits are being efficiently channeled to the reserves for funding growth. This is because even a profit-making company can have a deficiency of cash flow and go bankrupt while meeting its obligations. Therefore, one must look at a company\u2019s proficiency in generating cash flows before investing in the right stocks. This is because cash is the most indispensable factor for any company. It gives strength and vitality and is the key to its existence, development and success. This view is particularly relevant in light of the ongoing global economic uncertainty, coupled with market disruptions and dislocations. In this regard, stocks like DXP Enterprises, Inc. DXPE, Photronics, Inc. PLAB, GigaCloud Technology Inc. GCT and Mission Produce, Inc. AVO are worth buying. To figure out this efficiency, one needs to consider a company\u2019s net cash flow. While in any business, cash moves in and out, it is net cash flow that explains how much money a company is actually generating. If a company is experiencing a positive cash flow, it denotes an increase in its liquid assets, which gives it the means to meet debt obligations, shell out for expenses, reinvest in the business, endure downturns and finally return wealth to shareholders. On the other hand, a negative cash flow indicates a decline in the company\u2019s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves. However, having a positive cash flow merely does not secure a company\u2019s future growth. To ride on the growth curve, a company must have its cash flow increasing because that indicates management\u2019s efficiency in regulating its cash movements and less dependency on outside financing for running its business. Therefore, keep yourself abreast with the following screen to bet on stocks with rising cash flows. Screening Parameters: To find stocks that have seen increasing cash flow over time, we ran the screen for those whose cash flow in the latest reported quarter was at least equal to or greater than the 5-year average cash flow per common share . This implies a positive trend and increasing cash over a period of time. In addition to this, we chose: Zacks Rank 1: No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here . Average Broker Rating 1: This indicates that brokers are also highly hopeful about the company\u2019s future performance. Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This sieves out low-priced stocks. VGM Score of B or better: This score is also of great assistance in selecting stocks. Importantly, this scoring system helps in picking winning stocks in their industry categories. Here are four out of the 11 stocks that qualified for the screening: DXP Enterprises provides innovative pumping solutions, supply-chain services, and maintenance, repair, operating and production services. The consensus estimate for DXP Enterprises\u2019 current-year earnings has been revised 11.7% upward over the past two months. DXPE has a VGM Score of A.

A key element in the manufacture of semiconductors and flat panel displays, photomasks are used to transfer circuit patterns onto semiconductor wafers and flat panel substrates during the fabrication of integrated circuits, a variety of flat panel displays and, to a lesser extent, other types of electrical and optical components. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Photronics\u2019 fiscal 2025 earnings has moved up by 4.5% to $2.30 per share in the past two months. PLAB currently has a VGM Score of A.
