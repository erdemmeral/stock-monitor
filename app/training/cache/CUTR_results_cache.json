Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $46.48 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Cutera shares have lost about 83.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 24.3%. What's Next for Cutera? While Cutera has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

{"text": "Why Is Cutera Inc. (CUTR) Among the Best Cosmetic Surgery and Aesthetics Stocks to Invest In Now? Fatima Gulzar Wed, Dec 11, 2024, 6:48 AM 5 min read In This Article: CUTR -0.05% We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Cosmetic Surgery and Aesthetics Stocks to Invest in Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cutera Inc. (NASDAQ:CUTR) stands against the other cosmetic surgery and aesthetics stocks. In the face of economic uncertainty, consumer preferences in the beauty industry are changing. A Bloomberg Intelligence poll conducted in June 2024 with 650 participants found that 40% of respondents gave beauty and personal care purchases more importance than other products. Nonetheless, this represents the lowest result since the survey's launch two years ago, a 10-percentage-point drop from January. Despite the continued success of premium cosmetic products, there is less demand for mainstream, reasonably priced products, which make up the majority of the market. Leonard Lauder's \"Lipstick Index\" theory, which associates economic slowdowns with increased spending on self-care, seems less sound these days. Although the beauty industry has grown significantly over the last five years, Andrea Felsted, a Bloomberg Opinion columnist, observes that customer interests are beginning to shift. This drop in affordable beauty purchases raises questions about how well the industry can withstand economic downturns. The results point to changing customer behavior, with high-end products performing better and less expensive markets being squeezed during difficult economic conditions. Amidst this shift, according to Ulta CEO Dave Kimbell, younger generations, Gen Z and Gen Alpha, are more willing to spend money on beauty than previous generations, especially on skincare or as a way to express themselves. He also mentioned that a growing percentage of Americans are Hispanic consumers, who are more likely to be active in the area. Here are some comments from Kimbell: \u201cWhile we anticipate that some of these headwinds will persist in the near term, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our plans and set ourselves up for long-term growth.\u201d Meanwhile, the market for medical aesthetics, or procedures meant to enhance patients' physical attractiveness, is expected to grow in the future. According to research by senior partner Olivier Leclerc and colleagues, the CAGR for neuromodulators like Botox is anticipated to reach 11.9 percent in the US and Canada by 2025. By 2025, the compound annual growth rate for injectable dermal fillers, such as biostimulators and hyaluronic acid fillers, may reach 3.8 percent. Moreover, as per McKinsey's research report, through 2025, the medical aesthetics industry is expected to continue growing at a rate close to double digits. Story Continues In one of the recent developments, finance solutions like \"buy-now, pay-later\" loans are being given to make cosmetic procedures more affordable because of the rising demand for these procedures in the United States, as reported by Bloomberg. While the demand spike from the pandemic has subsided, rates of aesthetic procedures are still substantially higher than they were before COVID, with a 2023 increase over 2024, according to a June 2024 study from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Financing programs that divide expenses ranging from $200 to $10,000 into smaller installments over three to sixty months are now advantageous for facial procedures and other treatments. These choices are especially appealing to younger consumers because they frequently include interest-free terms and low credit requirements. According to Bloomberg, sales of asset-backed securities in the United States have increased by almost 20% year over year, reflecting this trend in the larger financial market. This highlights the connection between high customer demand and innovative financial solutions.

The company is making progress in operational excellence, particularly in field service, achieving industry-leading response times. Negative Points Total revenue for the third quarter decreased significantly compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to macroeconomic pressures and sales rep turnover.

Quarter 2024 Financial Results Business Wire Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 12:01 AM 13 min read In This Article: CUTR -0.05% BRISBANE, Calif., November 07, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--CUTERA, INC. (Nasdaq: CUTR), a leading provider of aesthetic and dermatology solutions, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. Consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2024 of $32.5 million Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $59.0 million AviClear growth of 16% vs prior year period driven by international capital system sales Global core capital growth of 7% on a sequential quarterly basis Full-year guidance maintained for both revenue and year-end cash balance \"Our third quarter reflects consistent execution against our strategic priorities, with core capital sales improving on a sequential basis, AviClear continuing to grow year-over-year driven by strong sales and utilization in international markets, and favorable underlying trends in our gross margin and operating expense profile,\" commented Taylor Harris, Chief Executive Officer of Cutera, Inc. \"We remain focused on expanding access to AviClear, our breakthrough technology for the treatment of acne, through training and education, practice development, and clinical indication expansion.\" Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights Consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $32.5 million, a decrease of 30% compared to the third quarter 2023. Revenue in the third quarter of 2023 included skincare revenue of $7.1 million; following the termination of our skincare distribution agreement in February 2024, the third quarter of 2024 did not include skincare revenue. Revenue related to capital systems sales declined 17%, while recurring sources of revenue, excluding skincare, declined 19%. Gross profit was $1.8 million, or 6% of revenue for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a gross profit of $6.5 million, or 14% of revenue, for the third quarter of 2023. On a non-GAAP basis, gross profit was $3.7 million, or 12% of revenue, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $9.0 million, or 19%, for the third quarter of 2023. Gross profit in the third quarter, on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, was negatively affected by $10.1 million, or 31% of revenue, of non-cash expense related to excess and obsolete inventory. Operating expenses were $38.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $47.4 million in the prior year period. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses were $34.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $39.8 million for the prior year period. Operating expenses for the third quarter of 2024, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, include a $5.4 million charge related to doubtful accounts receivable. The Company no longer adjusts for costs related to a retention plan implemented in April 2023, in its Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Accordingly, the Company has not adjusted for $0.4 million of retention plan costs incurred in the third quarter of 2024. Further, the Company has revised the presentation of current and prior year periods to remove adjustments related to retention plan costs of $4.0 million for the nine months ending September 30, 2024, and $1.4 million and $4.3 million, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Story Continues GAAP operating loss was $36.2 million and $40.9 million for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Non-GAAP operating loss was $31.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a Non-GAAP operating loss of $30.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, were $59.0 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $84.3 million as of June 30, 2024. 2024 Outlook Management is reaffirming full-year revenue guidance of $140 million to $145 million, as well as guidance for year-end 2024 cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of approximately $40 million.

Non-GAAP adjustments include depreciation and amortization including contract acquisition costs, stock-based compensation, enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\") implementation costs, certain legal and litigation costs, costs associated with restructuring activities and the separation of its officers and other executives, gain on termination of a distribution agreement, and certain other adjustments. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that the Company may exclude if the Company believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. The Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Company defines non-GAAP operating income (loss), also commonly known as adjusted EBITDA, as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, ERP implementation costs, certain legal and litigation costs, severance, gain on early termination of distribution agreement, and other adjustments. Company management uses non-GAAP financial measures as aids in monitoring the Company\u2019s ongoing financial performance from quarter to quarter, and year to year, and for benchmarking against other similar companies. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, the operating performance measure as prescribed by GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures for the statement of operations and net income per share exclude the following: Depreciation and amortization, including contract acquisition costs. The Company has excluded depreciation and amortization expense in calculating its non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measures. Depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges to current operations; Stock-based compensation. The Company has excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expenses in calculating its non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measures. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to the Company's employees, the Company continues to evaluate its business performance excluding stock-based compensation expenses. The Company records stock-based compensation expenses related to grants of options, employee stock purchase plans, and performance and restricted stock. Depending upon the size, timing, and terms of the grants, this expense may vary significantly but will recur in future periods. The Company believes that excluding stock-based compensation better allows for comparisons to its peer companies; ERP implementation costs. The Company has excluded ERP system costs related to direct and incremental costs incurred in connection with its multi-phase implementation of a new ERP solution and the related technology infrastructure costs. The Company excludes these costs because it believes that these items do not reflect future operating expenses and will be inconsistent in amounts and frequency, making it difficult to contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the Company\u2019s operating performance; Certain legal and litigation costs. The Company has excluded costs incurred related to its litigation against Lutronic Aesthetics as well as the settlement of $5.8 million, which is not part of the Company\u2019s ordinary course of business. The Company\u2019s complaint against Lutronic alleged misappropriation of trade secrets, violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"), interference with contractual relations and other claims. The Company excludes these costs as well as the settlement because this litigation is a result of a discrete event that was not part of the Company\u2019s business strategy, but has a significant effect on the results of operations. The costs are incidental to and do not reflect the efficiencies and effectiveness of the Company\u2019s core operations; Severance. The Company has excluded costs associated with restructuring activities and the separation of its officers and other executives in calculating its non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP Operating Income. The Company has excluded restructuring costs because a restructuring represents a discrete event that signifies a change in the Company\u2019s strategy, but these costs are not indicative of the ongoing financial performance of the business. The Company excludes executive separation costs because executive separations are unpredictable and not part of the Company\u2019s business strategy but could have a significant impact on the results of operations; Gain on early termination of distribution agreement. The Company has excluded a gain recorded in connection with the early termination of a distribution agreement with ZO USA in calculating its non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating income (loss). The Company recorded the net gain of $9.7 million in the Company's condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The Company has excluded this gain as it is not indicative of the ongoing financial performance of the business, and not part of the Company\u2019s business strategy. The Company believes that excluding all of the items above allows users of its financial statements to better review and assess both current and historical results of operations. The Company no longer adjusts for costs related to a retention plan implemented in April 2023, as such costs represent a normal, recurring, operating cost, and accordingly, has not adjusted for $0.4 million of retention plan costs incurred in the third quarter of 2024. Further, the Company has revised the presentation of the prior year periods to remove adjustments for retention plan costs of $1.4 million and $4.3 million, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Safe Harbor Statement Certain statements in this press release, other than purely historical information, are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). These statements include but are not limited to express or implied statements regarding expanding access to AviClear, and full year revenues and cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, along with other express or implied statements regarding Cutera\u2019s plans, objectives, strategies, financial performance, guidance and outlook, product launches and performance, trends, prospects, or future events. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as, but not limited to, \"may,\" \"could,\" \"seek,\" \"guidance,\" \"predict,\" \"potential,\" \"likely,\" \"believe,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"plan,\" \"intend,\" \"forecast,\" \"foresee\" or variations of these terms and similar expressions or the negative of these terms or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are difficult to predict and may cause Cutera's actual results to differ materially from the express or implied forward-looking statements herein. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and stockholders should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. There are several risks, uncertainties, and other important factors, many of which are beyond Cutera\u2019s control, that could cause its actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, including risks involved with continued expansion of AviClear, Cutera\u2019s financial position and debt service requirements, and making financial projections, as well as the other risks described in the \"Risk Factors\" section of Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and other documents filed from time to time with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission by Cutera. All statements made in this release are made only as of the date set forth at the beginning of this release. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements. Cutera undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements to reflect new information, events, or circumstances after the date they were made, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. If Cutera updates one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that it will make additional updates concerning those or other forward-looking statements. Cutera's financial performance for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, as discussed in this release, is preliminary and unaudited, and subject to adjustment. CUTERA, INC.

Dallas (Photo: Business Wire) Cutera collaborates with Dr. Edward Alvarez to provide truFlex \u00ae muscle stimulation treatments to help enhance the strength and endurance of adaptive athletes BRISBANE, Calif., November 12, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--CUTERA, INC. (Nasdaq: CUTR), a leading provider of aesthetic and dermatology solutions, announces their partnership with the Adaptive Training Foundation (ATF), a non-profit organization that provides access and inclusion to individuals living with physical or traumatic impairments empowering them through exercise and community. The Cutera team, with the support of Edward Alvarez, DDS, C.Ac, owner of Madison Avenue Face and Body , has provided ATF participants with truFlex muscle stimulation treatments to enhance strength, muscle tone, and endurance as ATF members undergo a vigorous nine-week training course. This specialized course, ReDefine, crafted by ATF, offers customized training with a group of individuals who are experiencing similar struggles. The athletes receive physical training and the tools to redefine their sense of self through mindfulness and mental training. \"I first learned about ATF through the incredible story of Makala Noble, a former high school athlete who was paralyzed in a tumbling accident, who displayed an unwavering dedication to recovery,\" said Dr. Alvarez. \"Makala\u2019s determination, combined with the powerful work ATF is doing on such a broad scale, instantly inspired me. Many of my patients have benefited from enhanced core strength with truFlex, so offering it to those who need specialized treatment options to help improve their quality of life felt like a natural fit.\" A survey study was also performed to evaluate the improvement in quality of life and the physical benefits of incorporating truFlex into the ReDefine training program. 3 Many participants praised their treatment experience and noted improvements in areas they have struggled to progress, such as their abdomen, glutes, and thighs. \"Cutera\u2019s truFlex technology has unlocked innovative new pathways for our ATF athletes to increase muscle function and create newfound body-empowerment,\" said David Vobora, ATF Founder. \"We are excited to see the potential this device has on a population that is underserved and can be greatly impacted by its technology.\" truFlex is the first muscle stimulation device to deliver energy to specific muscle groups in a convenient, 15-minute treatment. It covers the largest body surface area of any device in the industry and can replicate up to 54,000 contractions to increase muscle mass up to 30% in areas including the abdomen, obliques, thighs, and glutes after one treatment series. 1,2 Story Continues Cutera plans to donate the truFlex device at the end of the year to continue treatments for future cohorts of adaptive athletes and aid in the positive work of the Adaptive Training Foundation. \"We are honored to partner with such a worthwhile organization to share the positive effects of our unique muscle stimulation technology,\" said Taylor Harris, CEO of Cutera. \"This is just the start of our efforts to explore the additional benefits of truFlex while continuing to grow the body of evidence that supports the use of truFlex across multiple therapeutic indications.\" Interested providers and patients can visit yourtrubody.com to learn more about truFlex, and hear stories from patients about their experiences.
