[{"text": "Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About Builders FirstSource (BLDR): Should You Buy? Zacks Equity Research Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 5:30 PM 4 min read In This Article: BLDR -2.61% Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter? Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Builders FirstSource (BLDR) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage. Builders FirstSource currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.53, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 19 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.53 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy. Of the 19 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 13 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 68.4% and 10.5% of all recommendations. Brokerage Recommendation Trends for BLDR Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for BLDR Check price target & stock forecast for Builders FirstSource here>>> While the ABR calls for buying Builders FirstSource, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential. Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation. In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement. Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision. Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures. Story Continues The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5. It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them. In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research. In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks. Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements. Is BLDR Worth Investing In? In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Builders FirstSource, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 3.2% over the past month to $11.53. Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Builders FirstSource.

"AppLovin and Builders FirstSource have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day Zacks Equity Research Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 6:33 PM 11 min read In This Article: APP -1.12% SBUX +0.45% CMG +0.02% For Immediate Release Chicago, IL \u2013 January 27, 2025 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares AppLovin Corporation APP as the Bull of the Day and Builders FirstSource, Inc. BLDR as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Starbucks Corporation SBUX, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG and CAVA Group, Inc. CAVA. Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: Bull of the Day: AppLovin Corporation stock has been a Wall Street superstar over the last two years, soaring 3,000% to blow away Nvidia and most other artificial intelligence stocks. AppLovin is thriving as digital app developers and companies flock to its AI-boosted offerings in the hyper-competitive digital app economy. The app-monetization firm's 2025 earnings outlook has jumped even higher recently. APP stock has traded sideways for the past two months and looks due to break out to all-time highs sooner than later. Why This AI-Boosted Stock Outshined NVDA and Other Tech Stars AppLovin's software suite helps app developers improve marketing, revenue generation, and beyond to boost profitable expansion. APP's products and solutions enable companies and app developers to acquire and keep their ideal users, measure their marketing and reach, and much more. AppLovin's broad sales pitch to clients is that its technology attracts more users, keeps them engaged, and increases value across customer lifecycles. AppLovin boasts that it connects its clients to \"audiences in-app, on mobile devices, across CTV, and beyond so your business can do more, accelerate faster, and achieve meaningful growth.\" AppLovin's array of products are critical tools that its clients utilize to compete and thrive in the digital app world that's more competitive than ever. Everyone is competing for eyeballs in the attention economy and AppLovin's AI-boosted offerings are proving vital. AppLovin first rolled out its enhanced, machine learning and AI engine AXON technology in the second quarter of 2023. APP's machine learning and AI engine is generating impressive results for its clients across mobile gaming and beyond. APP's Growth Outlook AppLovin nearly doubled its sales (+93%) in 2021, growing its top line from $1.45 billion in 2020 to $2.79 billion in FY21. That massive YoY growth was always going to be difficult to replicate. AppLovin followed that up with 1% expansion in 2022 as the digital ad market tanked, dragging down Meta and many others. The digital ad market has come back to life since then. More importantly, AppLovin's improved portfolio has driven tangible results that its clients are paying for and helping boost its bottom line. Story Continues APP grew its revenue by 17% in 2023 and swung from a loss of -$0.52 a share to +$0.98. AppLovin grew its Software Platform revenue by 66% in Q3 of 2024, as clients spend heavily on offerings that have proven to consistently help them achieve their return on ad spending goals. APP's booming sales growth, mixed with its ability to lower costs, saw it grow its EPS by over 300%. APP is projected to grow its revenue by 40% in 2024 from $3.28 billion to $4.60 billion and then expand by 24% in FY25 to reach $5.68 billion\u2014adding over $1 billion to the top-line in both years. The digital app monetization firm is projected to grow its earnings by 314% from $0.98 to $4.06 a share in FY24. AppLovin's impressive earnings growth is projected to carry over into 2025 to the tune of 51% expansion to earn $6.12 a share. APP's EPS estimates have skyrocketed, with its FY25 estimate up 260% in the past 12 months. This includes a big surge since its Q3 earnings release in early November. APP's surging earnings revisions land it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). AppLovin's Most Accurate estimates are also coming in above consensus across the board and it has topped our EPS estimate by an average of 26% in the last four quarters. Is This Soaring Tech Stock Ready to Break Out to New Highs? AppLovin stock skyrocketed 3,00% in the past two years, leaving Nvidia's NVDA 650% run in the dust and crushing digital advertising titan Meta's META 360%. APP soared 730% in the past 12 months, while Nvidia jumped 130% and Meta climbed 65%. AppLovin's run helped it break above its late 2021 highs (April 2021 IPO) in September. APP stock has traded sideways since the middle of November following its post-Q3 release gap higher. APP might be due for a healthy pullback to recalibrate its valuation, which has grown a little stretched. That said, AppLovin has found support at its recently converging 21-day and 50-day moving averages. AppLovin's choppiness has helped cool down the stock. APP might experience profit-taking and fade down to its 200-day moving average (near its pre-Q3 release levels) if it provides underwhelming guidance on February 12. Long-term investors don't need to be too picky and try to time stocks exactly. Traders, meanwhile, might want to wait for a possible flush lower before rushing into this standout growth tech stock over the last several years. Bear of the Day: Builders FirstSource, Inc. is a building products supplier giant suffering through a rough patch following a boom run between 2020 and 2022, driven by soaring demand for home and multi-family construction and renovations. Builders FirstSource's earnings outlook is fading as the housing construction market normalizes. BLDR Stock Basics Builders First Source is one of the largest suppliers of building products, prefabricated components, and services to the professional market for new residential construction and remodeling. Builders First Source works with large and small customers via its roughly 570 distribution and manufacturing locations around the country. Builders First Source boasts that it works in 90 of the top 100 Metropolitan Statistical Areas. BLDR grew its sales by 18% in 2020 and then posted a mind-blowing 132% YoY sales expansion in 2021, climbing from $8.56 billion to roughly $20 billion. Builder First Source followed that surge up with another 14% sales growth in 2022. Builders First Source's impressive run was driven by the housing boom around the U.S., as well as some acquisitions. The housing construction market has cooled and its 2023 sales fell 25%, with revenue set to slip about 3.5% in 2024. BLDR is projected to bounce back with 6% growth in 2025 and it remains miles above its pre-Covid revenue totals. Bottom Line on BLDR Stock Right Now BLDR last quarter said that its profit margin slipped on the back of \"ongoing Multi-Family and core organic normalization.\" Builders First Source remains a great company and the housing shortage provides wind its sails over the long haul. In the short run, Builders First Source's adjusted earnings are projected to dive 21% in FY24 following a big pullback in 2023. On top of that, its earnings outlook has tanked and its Most Accurate estimate for 2025 came in 10% below its beaten-down consensus. Builders First Source lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now. On top of that, its Building Products \u2013 Retail space sits in the bottom 22% of over 250 Zacks industries. Investors interested in Builder First Source might want to wait for it to report its Q4 results and provide guidance on February 20 before they jump in. Additional content: How Will Starbucks Perform in 1st Full Quarter with Brian Niccol as CEO? Starbucks Corporation is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Jan. 28, 2025, after the closing bell. In the last reported quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 80 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line decreased 24.5% year over year. The company's earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and missed on two occasions with an average surprise of negative 4%. Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar. Trend in Estimate Revision of SBUX The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter EPS has declined to 65 cents from 66 cents in the past seven days. The expected figure indicates a fall of 27.8% from the year-ago quarter's 90 cents per share. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $9.31 billion. The metric suggests a deterioration of 1.2% from the year-ago quarter's figure. Factors Likely to Shape Starbucks' Quarterly Results Starbucks' fiscal first quarter performance is likely to have benefited from strong customer demand and an expanded store footprint. Initiatives such as reintroducing condiment coffee bars, simplifying the menu and offering non-dairy milk options (at no extra charge) are likely to have improved efficiency, enhanced throughput and reduced customer wait times, driving customer satisfaction and traffic in the fiscal first quarter. Seasonal menu items and holiday campaigns are anticipated to have played a role in driving customer visits during the fiscal first quarter. The rollout of the Clover Vertica brewers in more locations and investments in digital engagement, including enhancements to its mobile ordering system, is likely to have aided the company's fiscal first quarter top line. Despite its strong brand equity, Starbucks continues to face traffic challenges, particularly during off-peak hours and in U.S. stores. The company's focus on marketing to Starbucks Rewards members has unintentionally alienated non-members, leading to declines in foot traffic. Reflecting the ongoing challenges, our model predicts fiscal first-quarter comps to fall 4.4% year over year. SBUX's fiscal first-quarter margins may remain under pressure due to inflationary costs related to labor, raw materials and supply chain inefficiencies. While operational improvements are expected to partially offset these pressures, heightened promotional activity during the holiday season and investments in partner wages could weigh on the company's profitability. Our model predicts total operating expenses in the fiscal first quarter to rise 4.1% year over year to $5.2 billion.

(BLDR) Benjamin Rains Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 12:00 PM 2 min read Builders FirstSource, Inc. ( BLDR ) is a building products supplier giant suffering through a rough patch following a boom run between 2020 and 2022, driven by soaring demand for home and multi-family construction and renovations. Builders FirstSource\u2019s earnings outlook is fading as the housing construction market normalizes. BLDR Stock Basics Builders First Source is one of the largest suppliers of building products, prefabricated components, and services to the professional market for new residential construction and remodeling. Builders First Source works with large and small customers via its roughly 570 distribution and manufacturing locations around the country. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Builders First Source boasts that it works in 90 of the top 100 Metropolitan Statistical Areas. BLDR grew its sales by 18% in 2020 and then posted a mind-blowing 132% YoY sales expansion in 2021, climbing from $8.56 billion to roughly $20 billion. Builder First Source followed that surge up with another 14% sales growth in 2022. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Builders First Source\u2019s impressive run was driven by the housing boom around the U.S., as well as some acquisitions. The housing construction market has cooled and its 2023 sales fell 25%, with revenue set to slip about 3.5% in 2024. BLDR is projected to bounce back with 6% growth in 2025 and it remains miles above its pre-Covid revenue totals. Bottom Line on BLDR Stock Right Now BLDR last quarter said that its profit margin slipped on the back of \u201congoing Multi-Family and core organic normalization.\u201d Builders First Source remains a great company and the housing shortage provides wind at its sails over the long haul.

Black Bear Value Partners highlighted stocks like Core Natural Resources, Inc. (NYSE: CNR ) in its Q4 2024 investor letter. In January 2025, Core Natural Resources, Inc.

(NYSE:CNR) in its Q4 2024 investor letter: \"Core Natural Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CNR): Both ARCH and CEIX were down ~18% during the month of December as fears of retaliatory tariffs (these have a large export component to their businesses), economic slowing and likely tax-loss selling drove the stocks lower. Like our discussion on BLDR, the long-term story remains intact, and we used this as an opportunity to further concentrate our investment. Due to their impending merger neither Company can buy back their stock. Once the merger is complete in Q1 there should be abundant cash to buy back stock. I am generally constructive on the merger as the Companies should be able to realize some modest synergies. My sense is more mergers will be coming to this sector given the depressed prices of the securities.
