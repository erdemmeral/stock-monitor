DXPE, Photronics, Inc. PLAB, GigaCloud Technology Inc. GCT and Mission Produce, Inc. AVO. Look Beyond Profit: Bet on 4 Stocks with Increasing Cash Flows Crunching profit numbers and evaluating surprises might appear as a good option in the ongoing reporting cycle but these do not ensure that the profits are being efficiently channeled to the reserves for funding growth. This is because even a profit-making company can have a deficiency of cash flow and go bankrupt while meeting its obligations. Therefore, one must look at a company's proficiency in generating cash flows before investing in the right stocks. This is because cash is the most indispensable factor for any company. It gives strength and vitality and is the key to its existence, development and success. This view is particularly relevant in light of the ongoing global economic uncertainty, coupled with market disruptions and dislocations. In this regard, stocks like DXP Enterprises, Inc. , Photronics, Inc. , GigaCloud Technology Inc. and Mission Produce, Inc. are worth buying. To figure out this efficiency, one needs to consider a company's net cash flow. While in any business, cash moves in and out, it is net cash flow that explains how much money a company is actually generating. If a company is experiencing a positive cash flow, it denotes an increase in its liquid assets, which gives it the means to meet debt obligations, shell out for expenses, reinvest in the business, endure downturns and finally return wealth to shareholders. On the other hand, a negative cash flow indicates a decline in the company's liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves. However, having a positive cash flow merely does not secure a company's future growth. To ride on the growth curve, a company must have its cash flow increasing because that indicates management's efficiency in regulating its cash movements and less dependency on outside financing for running its business. Therefore, keep yourself abreast with the following screen to bet on stocks with rising cash flows. Here are four out of the 11 stocks that qualified for the screening: DXP Enterprises provides innovative pumping solutions, supply-chain services, and maintenance, repair, operating and production services.

Article: DXPE -3.10% Most of us have heard the dictum \"the trend is your friend.\" And this is undeniably the key to success when it comes to short-term investing or trading. But it isn't easy to ensure the sustainability of a trend and profit from it. Often, the direction of a stock's price movement reverses quickly after taking a position in it, making investors incur a short-term capital loss. So, it's important to ensure that there are enough factors -- such as sound fundamentals, positive earnings estimate revisions, etc. -- that could keep the momentum in the stock going. Investors looking to make a profit from stocks that are currently on the move may find our \"Recent Price Strength\" screen pretty useful. This predefined screen comes handy in spotting stocks that are on an uptrend backed by strength in their fundamentals, and trading in the upper portion of their 52-week high-low range, which is usually an indicator of bullishness. DXP Enterprises (DXPE) is one of the several suitable candidates that passed through the screen. Here are the key reasons why it could be a profitable bet for \"trend\" investors. A solid price increase over a period of 12 weeks reflects investors' continued willingness to pay more for the potential upside in a stock. DXPE is quite a good fit in this regard, gaining 118.1% over this period. However, it's not enough to look at the price change for around three months, as it doesn't reflect any trend reversal that might have happened in a shorter time frame. It's important for a potential winner to maintain the price trend. A price increase of 28.5% over the past four weeks ensures that the trend is still in place for the stock of this industrial products supplier. Moreover, DXPE is currently trading at 100% of its 52-week High-Low Range, hinting that it can be on the verge of a breakout. Looking at the fundamentals, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises -- the key factors that impact a stock's near-term price movements. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> Story Continues Another factor that confirms the company's fundamental strength is its Average Broker Recommendation of #1 (Strong Buy). This indicates that the brokerage community is highly optimistic about the stock's near-term price performance. So, the price trend in DXPE may not reverse anytime soon. In addition to DXPE, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our \"Recent Price Strength\" screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria. This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick.

{"text": "Look Beyond Profit, Bet on 4 Stocks With Increasing Cash Flows Moumita C. Chattopadhyay Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 4:58 PM 5 min read In This Article: DXPE -3.10% Crunching profit numbers and evaluating surprises might appear as a good option in the ongoing reporting cycle but these do not ensure that the profits are being efficiently channeled to the reserves for funding growth. This is because even a profit-making company can have a deficiency of cash flow and go bankrupt while meeting its obligations. Therefore, one must look at a company\u2019s proficiency in generating cash flows before investing in the right stocks. This is because cash is the most indispensable factor for any company. It gives strength and vitality and is the key to its existence, development and success. This view is particularly relevant in light of the ongoing global economic uncertainty, coupled with market disruptions and dislocations. In this regard, stocks like DXP Enterprises, Inc. DXPE, Photronics, Inc. PLAB, GigaCloud Technology Inc. GCT and Mission Produce, Inc. AVO are worth buying. To figure out this efficiency, one needs to consider a company\u2019s net cash flow. While in any business, cash moves in and out, it is net cash flow that explains how much money a company is actually generating. If a company is experiencing a positive cash flow, it denotes an increase in its liquid assets, which gives it the means to meet debt obligations, shell out for expenses, reinvest in the business, endure downturns and finally return wealth to shareholders. On the other hand, a negative cash flow indicates a decline in the company\u2019s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves. However, having a positive cash flow merely does not secure a company\u2019s future growth. To ride on the growth curve, a company must have its cash flow increasing because that indicates management\u2019s efficiency in regulating its cash movements and less dependency on outside financing for running its business. Therefore, keep yourself abreast with the following screen to bet on stocks with rising cash flows. Screening Parameters: To find stocks that have seen increasing cash flow over time, we ran the screen for those whose cash flow in the latest reported quarter was at least equal to or greater than the 5-year average cash flow per common share . This implies a positive trend and increasing cash over a period of time. In addition to this, we chose: Zacks Rank 1: No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here . Average Broker Rating 1: This indicates that brokers are also highly hopeful about the company\u2019s future performance. Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This sieves out low-priced stocks. VGM Score of B or better: This score is also of great assistance in selecting stocks. Importantly, this scoring system helps in picking winning stocks in their industry categories. Here are four out of the 11 stocks that qualified for the screening: DXP Enterprises provides innovative pumping solutions, supply-chain services, and maintenance, repair, operating and production services.

Shares of the maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) products distributor have surged 97.2% in the past six months, outpacing the Zacks sub-industry\u2019s and the S&P 500\u2019s growth of 3.4% and 8.2%, respectively. The company has also outperformed other industry players like Ingersoll Rand Inc. IR and Xylem Inc. XYL, which have lost 8.1% and 14.2%, respectively, over the said time frame. DXPE Outperforms Industry, S&P 500 & Peers Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The stock is trading above both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating solid upward momentum and price stability. This reflects a positive market sentiment and confidence in the company's financial health and long-term prospects. DXPE Shares Trading Above 50-Day and 200-Day SMA Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Factors Favoring the Company The strongest driver of DXP Enterprises\u2019 business at the moment is strength in its Service Centers segment, which grew approximately 8% year over year in third-quarter 2024. The segment has been benefiting from healthy demand for MRO products, equipment and integrated services, along with positive business mix and contributions from acquired assets. From a product perspective, strength in DXPE\u2019s U.S. safety services and metalworking product divisions and Canadian rotating equipment unit holds promise for its long-term growth. Solid momentum in the Innovative Pumping Solutions segment remains another growth catalyst for the company. Increased project-related work in the energy, water and wastewater treatment markets has been proving beneficial for the segment. Its performance has also been strengthened by an increase in prices from its vendors and suppliers along with the contributions from acquisitions. Driven by strength across end markets, the segment\u2019s revenues increased 52% in the third quarter of 2024. DXP Enterprises has booked a few large projects in both energy and water end markets, from which it expects to recognize revenues starting from the first quarter of 2025. That said, the company\u2019s focus on executing its current backlog and planning for modest volume growth across energy, biofuels, food and beverage and water and wastewater markets should drive its long-term growth. Management also remains focused on acquiring businesses to gain access to new customers, regions and product lines. For instance, in November 2024, DXPE completed the acquisitions of Burt Gurney & Associates (\u201cBGA\u201d) and MaxVac Inc. The inclusion of BGA expanded the reach of DXPE\u2019s Water division into new geographic territory while MaxVac enhanced its vacuum pump capabilities. Acquisitions had a contribution of 6% to the company\u2019s sales in the third quarter. Also, the company\u2019s focus on operational executions, supply-chain optimization and marketing activities is likely to boost its performance. Story Continues Earnings Estimate Revision The Zacks Consensus Estimate for DXP Enterprises\u2019 2025 earnings has increased 11.7% to $4.31 per share over the past 60 days, indicating year-over-year growth of 5.9%. Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar . Stock Valuation Despite the positives, DXPE\u2019s lofty valuation remains a concern. The stock is trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.82X, higher than the industry average of 21.49X. Also, it is overvalued compared with its peer, Flowserve Corporation FLS, which is trading at 19.62X. This elevated valuation could make the stock vulnerable to further pullbacks if market sentiment sours. Price-to-Earnings (Forward 12 Months) Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Our Final Take Robust momentum across safety services, metalworking products and rotating equipment businesses, along with strength in energy and wastewater treatment markets, positions DXP Enterprises favorably for impressive growth in the quarters ahead. Given the strength across most of its served markets, DXPE has built a healthy backlog level that should support its top-line performance. Despite its expensive valuation, positive analyst sentiment and robust growth prospects indicate it is the right time for potential investors to bet on this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company.

Surges 38% in a Year: Is It Still Good Time to Buy? Zacks Equity Research Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 4:56 PM 6 min read In This Article: NTAP -1.95% NetApp \u2019s NTAP shares have proven resilient, with a 37.8% gain in the past year, outpacing the industry\u2019s growth of 10.7%. NetApp provides enterprise storage as well as data management software and hardware products and services. It has also outperformed the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500 composite\u2019s growth of 27.8% and 24.8%, respectively. Closing at $122.09 in the last trading session, NTAP stock is currently trading 9.9% below its 52-week high of $135.45, attained on Nov. 22, 2024. Price Performance Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research With the pullback from 52-week high along with strong business momentum, is NTAP an attractive investment opportunity? Let us discuss NTAP\u2019s prospects and ascertain how to strategize investment. NTAP\u2019s Flash & Public Cloud Business Key Drivers NetApp is witnessing higher demand from customers for its portfolio of modern all-flash arrays, especially the C-series capacity flash and ASA block-optimized flash. The new all-flash A-series is also picking up momentum. These enterprise storage products will allow users to boost workloads including traditional enterprise applications and Gen AI. The company expects the new AFF A-series, along with its C-series and ASA products, to capture further share in the all-flash market. In the fiscal second quarter, the company\u2019s All-Flash Array Business\u2019s annualized net revenue run rate was $3.8 billion, up 19% year over year. Total billings rose 9% year over year to $1.59 billion. Also, Keystone\u2019s storage-as-a-service offering has been gaining significant traction, with revenues increasing more than 55% year over year in the fiscal second quarter. Unbilled RPO was $330 million, up 11% quarter over quarter. Unbilled RPO is a key indicator of Keystone's growth. Solid momentum in hyperscaler first-party and marketplace storage services has been driving revenues from the Public Cloud. The Public Cloud segment comprises revenues from products delivered as a service and related supports. The portfolio contains cloud automation and optimization services, storage and cloud infrastructure monitoring services. Public Cloud segment\u2019s revenues improved 9% to $168 million, driven by 43% increase in first-party and marketplace cloud storage services. Driven by strength in the cloud storage business, NetApp now expects cloud revenues to return to double-digit growth year over year from the current quarter. NTAP Raises Outlook Driven by strong year-to-date performance and strength in flash, block, cloud and AI, NetApp now expects full-year revenues in the range of $6.54-$6.74 billion, up 6% year over year at the mid-point. Earlier it anticipated sales in the band of $6.48-$6.68 billion. The company now forecasts non-GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2025 to be between $7.20 and $7.40, up 13% year over year at the mid-point. Earlier, it expected non-GAAP earnings between $7 and $7.20 per share. For fiscal 2025, NetApp continues to expect non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 71-72%. Non-GAAP operating margin is anticipated in the band of 28-28.5% compared with 27-28%. NetApp recently inked a definitive agreement to divest its Spot by NetApp FinOps business to Flexera, a global technology spend and risk management player. NetApp acquired cloud services startup \u2013\u2013 Spot \u2013\u2013 in July 2020.\u00a0 The divesture aligns seamlessly with NetApp\u2019s vision of fostering long-term growth and innovation in the intelligent data infrastructure. While the financial details of the transaction remain undisclosed, the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Story Continues AI Momentum Long-term Growth Driver for NTAP Apart from the demand for flash and block, increasing demand for NetApp\u2019s cloud storage and AI solutions bodes well. In the fiscal second quarter, the company won more than 100 AI and data lake modernization deals. The company is also working on the development of GenAI cloud and on-premises solutions in collaboration with industry behemoths. NetApp expanded its partnership with Google Cloud to provide the foundational data storage for the Google Distributed Cloud and make AI-ready infrastructure available to the public sector and other highly regulated industries. NetApp's intelligent data infrastructure, bolstered by ONTAP and StorageGRID solutions, empowers its customers to efficiently scale workloads and harness AI while ensuring security and regulatory compliance. Google Distributed Cloud will also use these capabilities to enhance its services, including databases, AI and analytics. NTAP\u2019s Healthy Capital Allocation Strategy Management\u2019s execution has been favorable in recent times. NetApp\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and investments was $2.22 billion while long-term debt was $1.244 billion as of Oct. 25, 2024. For the fiscal second quarter, the company generated net cash from operations was $105 million and free cash flow was $60 million. Net cash balance provides the required flexibility to pursue any growth strategy, whether through acquisitions or otherwise. A strong balance sheet helps NetApp to continue its shareholder-friendly initiatives of dividend payouts. The company returned $406 million to its shareholders as dividend payouts and share repurchases in the last reported quarter. The company has $800 million worth of shares remaining under its existing authorization. NetApp also announced a dividend of 52 cents per share payable on Jan. 22, 2025, to its shareholders of record as of the close of business on Jan. 3.

Value Of DXP Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXPE) editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sat, Jan 18, 2025, 3:58 PM 6 min read In This Article: DXPE -3.10% Key Insights The projected fair value for DXP Enterprises is US$102 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity With US$103 share price, DXP Enterprises appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value Industry average of 33% suggests DXP Enterprises' peers are currently trading at a higher premium to fair value Does the January share price for DXP Enterprises, Inc. ( NASDAQ:DXPE ) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example! We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model . See our latest analysis for DXP Enterprises The Method We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$80.0m US$94.0m US$92.6m US$92.3m US$92.9m US$94.0m US$95.6m US$97.4m US$99.5m US$101.7m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ -1.50% Est @ -0.26% Est @ 0.60% Est @ 1.21% Est @ 1.63% Est @ 1.93% Est @ 2.14% Est @ 2.28% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.7% US$74.3 US$81.0 US$74.0 US$68.6 US$64.0 US$60.1 US$56.7 US$53.7 US$50.9 US$48.3 (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$632m Story Continues After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.7%. Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$102m\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (7.7%\u2013 2.6%) = US$2.0b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = US$2.0b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.7%) 10 = US$970m The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$1.6b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$103, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. NasdaqGS:DXPE Discounted Cash Flow January 18th 2025 The Assumptions The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at DXP Enterprises as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.241. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for DXP Enterprises Strength Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry. Debt is well covered by cash flow. Weakness Earnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average. Interest payments on debt are not well covered. Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years. Threat No apparent threats visible for DXPE. Next Steps: Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Strong Momentum Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Portfolio Returns Vaishali Doshi Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 3:57 PM 7 min read In This Article: HUBS -1.87% EVER -0.54% DXPE -3.10% Investors looking for high returns are likely to benefit from adding stocks with a robust liquidity level, as it promotes business growth. Liquidity primarily determines a company\u2019s capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents. These stocks have always been on investors\u2019 radar owing to their potential to provide strong returns. Investors can consider adding four top-ranked stocks like DXP Enterprises, Inc . DXPE, Ubiquiti Inc. UI, HubSpot, Inc. HUBS and EverQuote, Inc. EVER to their portfolios to boost returns. However, one should be alert before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is clearing its dues at a faster rate compared with peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use assets efficiently. Hence, one may consider a company\u2019s efficiency level in addition to its liquidity for identifying prospective winners. Measures to Identify Liquid Stocks Current Ratio : It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. The ratio gauges a company\u2019s potential to meet short- and long-term debt obligations. A current ratio \u2014 the working capital ratio \u2014 below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. A high current ratio does not always suggest that the company is in good financial shape. It may also indicate that the firm failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1-3 is considered ideal. Quick Ratio : Unlike the current ratio, the quick ratio \u2014 the \u201cacid-test ratio\u201d or \u201cquick assets ratio\u201d \u2014 indicates a company\u2019s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory, excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. A quick ratio of more than 1 is desirable, like the current ratio. Cash Ratio : This is the most conservative ratio among the three, considering cash and cash equivalents and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company\u2019s ability to meet existing debt obligations using the most liquid assets. Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may suggest sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization. A ratio greater than 1 is always desirable but may not always represent a company\u2019s financial condition. Screening Parameters To pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization \u2014 a widely used measure of a company\u2019s efficiency \u2014 as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales in the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their industries can be considered efficient. Story Continues We added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen to ensure these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential. Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 : While liquidity ratios greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency. Asset utilization is more significant than the industry average : Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company\u2019s efficiency. Zacks Rank equal to #1 : Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Growth Score less than or equal to B : Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B handily beat other stocks when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy). These criteria have narrowed the universe of more than 7,700 stocks to only 10. Here are four of the 10 stocks that qualified the screen: DXP Enterprises is one of the foremost products and service distributors that adds value and total cost savings solutions to industrial clients across Canada, Mexico, the United States and Dubai. The company\u2019s performance is gaining from moderating inflationary pressure and varied spending across end markets. In the last reported quarter, revenues improved 12.8% year over year to $472.9 million.\u00a0 Healthy execution of the growth strategy and benefits from acquisition are other tailwinds. In November 2024, DXPE acquired two companies \u2014 Burt Gurney & Associates and MaxVac Inc. These acquisitions were funded by utilizing cash on the balance sheet. These companies offer value-added products and services to water and vacuum pump verticals. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for DXPE 2024 earnings is pegged at $4.07 per share, suggesting an improvement of 14.3% in the past 60 days. The company has a Growth Score of A. Ubiquiti , along with its subsidiaries, offers a comprehensive portfolio of networking products and solutions for service providers and enterprises. Its service-provider product platforms offer carrier-class network infrastructure for fixed wireless broadband, wireless backhaul systems and routing. Enterprise product platforms provide wireless local area network infrastructure, video surveillance products and machine-to-machine communication components. Ubiquiti reported strong first-quarter fiscal 2025 results, with the top and bottom lines surpassing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company is benefiting from solid growth in the Enterprise Technology segment, backed by healthy demand in North America, Europe and the Middle East and Africa regions. Its strategy of consistent dividend payments while maintaining a sustainable payout ratio is positive. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $7.30 per share, up 1.8% in the past 60 days. The company has a Growth Score of A. HubSpot provides inbound marketing and sales application over the cloud. The software-as-a-service or SaaS vendor helps businesses attract more customers through search engine optimization, social media, blogging, website content management, marketing automation, email, Customer Relationship Management, analytics and reporting. HubSpot\u2019s growing customer base, cross-selling opportunities, the One HubSpot initiative and expanding international footprint are key positives. The company has rolled out multiple updates to its Sales Hub product, including a low-priced Starter tier and improvement to its sales engagement tools to make them more affordable for growing sales teams. Its AI-powered content marketing solutions, such as content remix and GPT-powered chatbots, are gaining popularity. The acquisition of Cacheflow will likely bolster customer engagement in Commerce Hub. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HUBS\u2019 2024 earnings of $8.00 per share has remained unchanged in the past seven days. The company has a Growth Score of A and a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 15.4%, on average. EverQuote , headquartered in Cambridge, MA, is an online insurance marketplace. The company's websites allow consumers to shop for auto, home, renters and life insurance. EverQuote is gaining from its exclusive data asset and technology, deepened focus on core P&C markets and a robust financial profile.\u00a0 It is also focused on streamlining traffic operations, boosting AI-powered bidding solutions, and rolling out advanced agent technology platforms. These position it well for long-term growth. Recovery in automotive and other insurance verticals, given auto carrier recovery and growth in revenue per quote request, bodes well. In the last reported quarter, total revenues of $144.5 million increased 163% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EVER\u2019s 2024 earnings is pegged at 73 cents per share, unchanged in the past 30 days.

GPOR. 5 Stocks with Recent Price Strength Amid Wall Street Volatility U.S. stock markets have been facing severe volatility since the beginning of 2025. Market participants are concerned about the forward trajectory of both inflation and interest rates. Moreover, treasury yields remain elevated. The Fed reduced the benchmark lending rate by a significant 1% in 2024. In September, the Fed indicated of another 1% rate cut in 2025. However, a strong U.S. economy, a resilient labor market and sticky inflation have raised concerns about rate cut this year. Consequently, a few stocks have shown price strength. We have primarily targeted stocks that have recently been on a bull run. Such stocks have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward. Five such stocks are \u2014 OppFi Inc. , DXP Enterprises Inc. , Carpenter Technology Corp. , United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Gulfport Energy Corp. If a stock is continuously witnessing an uptrend, there must be a solid reason or it would have probably crashed. So, looking at stocks capable of beating the benchmark that they have set for themselves seems rational. However, recent price strength alone cannot create magic.

Recent Price Strength Amid Wall Street Volatility Nalak Das Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 4:43 PM 5 min read In This Article: CRS -0.99% DXPE -3.10% UAL -0.95% U.S. stock markets have been facing severe volatility since the beginning of 2025. Market participants are concerned about the forward trajectory of both inflation and interest rates. Moreover, treasury yields remain elevated. The Fed reduced the benchmark lending rate by a significant 1% in 2024. In September, the Fed indicated of another 1% rate cut in 2025. However, a strong U.S. economy, a resilient labor market and sticky inflation have raised concerns about rate cut this year. Consequently, a few stocks have shown price strength. We have primarily targeted stocks that have recently been on a bull run. Such stocks have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward. Five such stocks are \u2014 OppFi Inc. OPFI, DXP Enterprises Inc. DXPE, Carpenter Technology Corp. CRS, United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL and Gulfport Energy Corp. GPOR. If a stock is continuously witnessing an uptrend, there must be a solid reason or it would have probably crashed. So, looking at stocks capable of beating the benchmark that they have set for themselves seems rational. However, recent price strength alone cannot create magic. Therefore, other relevant parameters are needed to create a successful investment strategy. Here\u2019s how you should create the screen to shortlist the current as well as the potential winners. Screening Parameters: Percentage Change in Price (4 Weeks) greater than zero: This criterion shows that the stock has moved higher in the last four weeks. Percentage Change Price (12 Weeks) greater than 10: This indicates that the stock has seen momentum over the last three months. This lowers the risk of choosing stocks that may have drawn attention due to the overwhelming performance of the overall market in a very short period. Zacks Rank 1: No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Average Broker Rating 1 or 2: This indicates that brokers are also highly hopeful about the stock\u2019s future performance. Current Price greater than 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5. Current Price/ 52-Week High-Low Range more than 85%: This criterion filters stocks that are trading near their respective 52-week highs. It indicates that these are strong enough in terms of price. Just these few criteria narrowed down the search from over 7,700 stocks to 14. Let\u2019s discuss five out of these 14 stocks: OppFi Inc. is a tech-enabled specialty finance platform that broadens the reach of community banks to extend credit access to everyday Americans.

Most of us have heard the dictum \"the trend is your friend.\" And this is undeniably the key to success when it comes to short-term investing or trading. But it isn't easy to ensure the sustainability of a trend and profit from it. Often, the direction of a stock's price movement reverses quickly after taking a position in it, making investors incur a short-term capital loss. So, it's important to ensure that there are enough factors -- such as sound fundamentals, positive earnings estimate revisions, etc. -- that could keep the momentum in the stock going. Our \"Recent Price Strength\" screen, which is created on a unique short-term trading strategy, could be pretty useful in this regard. This predefined screen makes it really easy to shortlist the stocks that have enough fundamental strength to maintain their recent uptrend. Also, the screen passes only the stocks that are trading in the upper portion of their 52-week high-low range, which is usually an indicator of bullishness. There are several stocks that passed through the screen and DXP Enterprises (DXPE) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a solid choice for \"trend\" investing. A solid price increase over a period of 12 weeks reflects investors' continued willingness to pay more for the potential upside in a stock. DXPE is quite a good fit in this regard, gaining 48.9% over this period. However, it's not enough to look at the price change for around three months, as it doesn't reflect any trend reversal that might have happened in a shorter time frame. It's important for a potential winner to maintain the price trend. A price increase of 2.9% over the past four weeks ensures that the trend is still in place for the stock of this industrial products supplier. Moreover, DXPE is currently trading at 90.6% of its 52-week High-Low Range, hinting that it can be on the verge of a breakout. Looking at the fundamentals, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises -- the key factors that impact a stock's near-term price movements. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> Story Continues Another factor that confirms the company's fundamental strength is its Average Broker Recommendation of #1 (Strong Buy). This indicates that the brokerage community is highly optimistic about the stock's near-term price performance. So, the price trend in DXPE may not reverse anytime soon. In addition to DXPE, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our \"Recent Price Strength\" screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria. This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market. However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.
