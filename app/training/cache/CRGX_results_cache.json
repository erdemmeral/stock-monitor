(NASDAQ: CRGX) , a clinical-stage biotechnology company positioned to advance next-generation, potentially curative cell therapies for cancer patients, today provided a corporate update and anticipated milestones for 2025. \u201c2024 highlighted our excellence in execution and innovation. We now have three programs \u2013 two clinical-stage with another advancing quickly \u2013 all driven by our strong capabilities designing, developing, and delivering next-generation, and potentially curative cell therapies,\u201d said Gina Chapman, President and Chief Executive Officer of CARGO. \u201cWe are on track to report our interim analysis results for FIRCE-1 in first half 2025. I am also delighted to announce the clearance of our IND for CRG-023, a potentially best-in-class CAR T-cell therapy with Phase 1 enrollment to initiate mid-year. Rapid progression of CRG-023 from lead construct to IND submission in less than 12 months was enabled by our robust CMC and pre-clinical development capabilities. Finally, I\u2019m very excited to announce our novel allogeneic platform, which I believe can meaningfully improve the availability of potentially curative cell therapies for patients by realizing the promise of an allogeneic solution in a universally applicable way. I\u2019d like to thank the entire CARGO organization for their tenacity and innovative spirit, positioning us for our important milestones this year.\u201d \u201cThe challenges that limit a broader impact for autologous cell therapy include the quality of T cells derived from sick patients and availability of product. For allogeneic cell therapy, durable efficacy has been difficult to achieve,\u201d said Michael Ports, Chief Scientific Officer of CARGO. \u201cOver the past three years, we set out to solve these limitations through sophisticated cell therapy design and engineering, starting with CRG-023 and now with our novel allogenic platform that is intended to address immune-based rejection of allogeneic CAR T. The allogeneic CAR T platform is comprised of a universal vector with multiple transgene \u201ccargo\u201d to limit T and NK rejection and downregulate TCR. Importantly, the vector can be paired with pre-existing CAR vectors across targets and indications and can leverage existing autologous drug product processes. We are encouraged by our preclinical results which suggest the potential of a universal approach to creating off-the-shelf allogeneic CAR T products to provide more life-saving therapies for patients.\u201d Story Continues Corporate Update and Anticipated Milestones for 2025: Firi-cel : As of December 31, 2024, 71 patients have been dosed in the potentially pivotal Phase 2 study of firi-cel, FIRCE-1. CARGO continues to achieve strong manufacturing success of firi-cel. The Company is partnering with National Resilience, Inc. and ElevateBio to manufacture drug product for the FIRCE-1 study. CARGO expects to share topline data from an interim analysis for a meaningful patient sample size with at least 3 months of follow-up in 1H\u201925. CRG-023 : In January, the FDA cleared the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for CRG-023, CARGO\u2019s novel tri-specific CAR T that is designed to address several known causes of relapse, resulting in a potential best-in-class CAR T-cell therapy across a broad range of B-cell malignancies with the goal of providing more patients with a durable complete response. CRG-023 is a first-of-its-kind CAR T to express three independent CARs (CD19, CD20, CD22) from a single vector, with each CAR having a distinct co-stimulatory domain. CRG-023 lentiviral vector is produced using suspension culture process which provides a line of sight to commercially suitable expression level. CRG-023 drug product is produced leveraging CARGO\u2019s internally developed process and analytical methods. Given the encouraging pre-clinical data of CRG-023, CARGO intends to demonstrate the product candidate\u2019s best-in-class potential through a Phase 1 dose escalation study in 3L+ LBCL including CAR T-na\u00efve patients. The Company plans to leverage proof-of-concept data to support moving quickly into earlier lines of therapy and additional indications in B-cell malignancies for CRG-023. The Phase 1, open-label, multi-center, dose escalation and dose expansion study is expected to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of CRG-023 and to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose of CRG-023. Dose escalation will begin at a dose level of 25 million cells, which was informed by preclinical data that demonstrated in vivo tumor clearance at low dose levels. Enrollment for the Phase 1 study, including CAR T-na\u00efve patients, is expected to initiate mid-year 2025. CARGO plans to leverage its established manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure to accelerate readiness for its Phase 1 study. Novel Allogeneic Platform: CARGO\u2019s novel allogeneic platform is a universal vector solution designed to limit immune-based rejection and enable durable response of CAR T-cell therapy. Through sophisticated engineering, the differentiated platform aims to transform potentially curative autologous CAR T-cell therapies into allogeneic products for broader patient benefit. The universal, allogeneic-enabling vector is intended to pair with new or clinically established CAR vectors, which can be accomplished while leveraging existing autologous drug product processes. The result is intended to be an off-the-shelf allogeneic CAR T product designed to limit rejection, promote safety, improve the starting quality of T cells, and maintain comparable CAR-mediated activity. To date, CARGO has advanced several lead allogeneic constructs and demonstrated proof of concept in limiting immune rejection, preventing graft vs. host disease (GvHD), and preserving comparable CAR activity when co-transduced with CAR vector utilized for autologous CAR T-cell therapy. CARGO expects to select the lead vector candidate in 1H\u201925. Financial Outlook : As of December 31, 2024, the Company\u2019s preliminary cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $368.1 million ( 1) , which we believe will be sufficient to fund our expected operations through 2026. Gina Chapman, President and Chief Executive Officer, is scheduled to present at the 43rd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference on Monday, January 13, at 10:30 a.m. PT. Interested parties can access the live webcast for the presentation in the Investors section of CARGO\u2019s website under News & Events .

(CRGX) Looks Ripe for a Turnaround Zacks Equity Research Tue, Dec 17, 2024, 2:34 AM 2 min read In This Article: CRGX +1.39% CARGO Therapeutics, Inc. (CRGX) has been on a downward spiral lately with significant selling pressure. After declining 14.1% over the past four weeks, the stock looks well positioned for a trend reversal as it is now in oversold territory and there is strong agreement among Wall Street analysts that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier. How to Determine if a Stock is Oversold We use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30. Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal. So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound. However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision. Why a Trend Reversal is Due for CRGX The heavy selling of CRGX shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 27.58. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand. This technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering CRGX in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 5.2% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term. Moreover, CRGX currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

{"text": "Bears are Losing Control Over CARGO Therapeutics, Inc. (CRGX), Here's Why It's a 'Buy' Now Zacks Equity Research Thu, Dec 12, 2024, 5:55 PM 3 min read In This Article: CRGX +1.39% A downtrend has been apparent in CARGO Therapeutics, Inc. (CRGX) lately. While the stock has lost 5.9% over the past week, it could witness a trend reversal as a hammer chart pattern was formed in its last trading session. This could mean that the bulls have been able to counteract the bears to help the stock find support. While the formation of a hammer pattern is a technical indication of nearing a bottom with potential exhaustion of selling pressure, rising optimism among Wall Street analysts about the future earnings of this company is a solid fundamental factor that enhances the prospects of a trend reversal for the stock. 1-month candlestick chart for CRGX Understanding Hammer Chart and the Technique to Trade It This is one of the popular price patterns in candlestick charting. A minor difference between the opening and closing prices forms a small candle body, and a higher difference between the low of the day and the open or close forms a long lower wick (or vertical line). The length of the lower wick being at least twice the length of the real body, the candle resembles a 'hammer.' In simple terms, during a downtrend, with bears having absolute control, a stock usually opens lower compared to the previous day's close, and again closes lower. On the day the hammer pattern is formed, maintaining the downtrend, the stock makes a new low. However, after eventually finding support at the low of the day, some amount of buying interest emerges, pushing the stock up to close the session near or slightly above its opening price. When it occurs at the bottom of a downtrend, this pattern signals that the bears might have lost control over the price. And, the success of bulls in stopping the price from falling further indicates a potential trend reversal. Hammer candles can occur on any timeframe -- such as one-minute, daily, weekly -- and are utilized by both short-term as well as long-term investors. Like every technical indicator, the hammer chart pattern has its limitations. Particularly, as the strength of a hammer depends on its placement on the chart, it should always be used in conjunction with other bullish indicators. Here's What Makes the Trend Reversal More Likely for CRGX An upward trend in earnings estimate revisions that CRGX has been witnessing lately can certainly be considered a bullish indicator on the fundamental side. That's because empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for the current year has increased 14.6%. What it means is that the sell-side analysts covering CRGX are majorly in agreement that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier. Story Continues If this is not enough, you should note that CRGX currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. And stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 usually outperform the market. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> Moreover, the Zacks Rank has proven to be an excellent timing indicator, helping investors identify precisely when a company's prospects are beginning to improve. So, for the shares of CARGO Therapeutics, Inc. a Zacks Rank of 2 is a more conclusive fundamental indication of a potential turnaround. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
