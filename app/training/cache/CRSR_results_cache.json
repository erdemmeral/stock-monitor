[{"text": "We\u2019re Still Thinking About These Super Weird Gadgets From CES 2025 Britney Nguyen and Jackie Snow Sun, Jan 12, 2025, 4:30 PM 7 min read Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang holds a Drive Thor processor during his keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 6, 2025. - Photo: Patrick T. Fallon/AFP (Getty Images) Welcome to CES 2025, where tech companies are showing off their latest innovations \u2014 some more practical than others. From $60,000 transparent TVs to RGB-lit RAM sticks, this year\u2019s show is all about pushing boundaries (and price tags). Let\u2019s take a look at some of the most eye-catching announcements and one fashion moment. A wearable to read your mind A brain computer interface for $89 - Screenshot: Omi Another wearable wants to be your AI bestie \u2014 this time, it\u2019s Omi , an $89 device you wear around your neck (or, if you\u2019re feeling bold, on your temple with medical tape). It\u2019s always listening, ready to summarize your conversations or look up Bitcoin prices. The company\u2019s even working on making it read your thoughts, which they say is totally sci-fi... but maybe possible in two years? Hey, at least it won\u2019t cost you $60,000 like some other things at CES. Security bot that will protect you with paintballs Paintcam has nine different projectile options including paint and pepper spray - Photo: Paintcam And now for something completely different: a security camera that shoots paintballs at intruders. The PaintCam comes in four models, including one specifically for scaring off wildlife. It can even use UV paint to help police track down tagged intruders. The company calls this \u2018Safety Simplified\u2019 because nothing says simple like a home security system that doubles as a paintball gun. Jensen Huang\u2019s new leather jacket Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang holds a personal AI supercomputer during his keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 6, 2025. - Photo: Patrick T. Fallon/AFP (Getty Images) Nvidia\u2019s ( NVDA ) chief executive Jensen Huang walked onto the CES stage for his keynote in his signature style \u2014 a sleek black leather jacket. But this wasn\u2019t just any jacket \u2014 it was a new $8,990 Tom Ford number with an embossed crocodile pattern. During the presentation, he even asked the audience if they liked his latest look. It\u2019s similar \u2014 both in looks and cost \u2014 to one he wore at another tech conference in 2024. But hey, when you run a company worth $3.44 trillion, why not have a new jacket for every event? Colorful DRAM Corsair Custom Lab\u2019s DRAM sticks. - Image: CORSAIR Nvidia\u2019s chief executive wasn\u2019t the only one sporting a new look at CES \u2014 Corsair ( CRSR ) is bringing their Custom Lab creativity to DRAM sticks. They\u2019ve got eight designs, including delicate cherry blossom and futuristic sci-fi light patterns, available in black, white, or gray. These aren\u2019t just DRAM modules with a pretty paint job \u2014 they\u2019re still high-performance memory. Looks like your PC\u2019s memory is ready for its fashion moment. A $1,900 smart ring Ultrahuman\u2019s Rare ring. - Screenshot: Ultrahuman Ultrahuman unveiled a smart ring in 18-karat gold for $1,900 (or $2,200 if you prefer platinum). At a time when other wearables like Humane\u2019s AI Pin are struggling to find their footing, Ultrahuman is betting that luxury shoppers want their health tracking to come with a designer price tag. Functionally, it\u2019s identical to their $350 Ring Air \u2014 but hey, at least this one\u2019s named after desert dunes and comes with a lifetime subscription. Story Continues A gaming chair that can blast you with hot or cold air Razer\u2019s Project Arielle mesh gaming chair with an integrated fan system. - Image: Razer Razer has a new take on gaming comfort \u2014 their prototype gaming chair can blast you with hot or cold air. And because this is Razer at CES, of course, this temperature-controlled chair needed a dramatic name: Project Arielle. The chair uses a bladeless fan system that can cool you down during intense gaming sessions or warm you up on chilly days. Unlike most of Razer\u2019s wild CES concepts (remember that fold-out triple-screen laptop ?), this one actually seems practical, if a little decadent. Though you\u2019ll have to stay plugged in \u2014 spinning 360 degrees will turn you into a power cable mummy. AI agents that can roast you (or cheer you on) while gaming Streamlabs, Inworld AI, and Nvidia\u2019s AI agent for streaming. - Screenshot: Streamlabs on YouTube Now AI wants to be your gaming buddy \u2014 or your worst critic. Inworld AI and Streamlabs ( LOGI ) are cooking up an \u2018Intelligent Streaming Assistant\u2019 that can hype up your Fortnite victories or, presumably, roast your building skills. It\u2019ll even trigger special effects when you do something impressive, though based on the demo, it looks about as natural as a robot trying to do stand-up comedy. Want a sassy AI cohost commenting on your gameplay? Coming to Streamlabs later this year, your mileage may vary depending on your gaming and how able you can handle some heckling. A lamp that doubles as a smart garden LG Electronics\u2019 smart garden standing lamp. - Image: LG Electronics LG ( LPL ) is bringing together two things we never knew we needed combined: a smart lamp and an indoor garden. Their new floor-standing light doubles as a plant sanctuary, with LED lighting that can both nurture your greenery and set the mood. It\u2019s got a clever shelf in the middle for growing up to twenty plants, and a built-in watering system that knows exactly what your leafy friends need. Finally, a smart home gadget that might actually make your home feel more alive \u2014 though, like many of LG\u2019s coolest innovations revealed at CES, there\u2019s no guarantee it\u2019ll make it to stores near you any time soon. Check your temp? Nah, check your hormones Hormometer - Image: Consumer Electronics Show (CES) Tired of just tracking your steps and sleep? The Hormometer wants you to check your hormones, too. It\u2019s a simple stick that uses your saliva and phone camera to measure stress and reproductive hormones like cortisol and progesterone. At $8 a month, it\u2019s way cheaper than traditional lab tests \u2014 though experts are raising eyebrows at the whole \u2018hormone balancing\u2019 trend it\u2019s riding. Still, for anyone dealing with actual hormone-related health issues, having lab-quality results without the lab visit could be a game-changer. A robot vacuum with legs Dreame Technology\u2019s X50 Ultra robot vacuum. - Photo: Dreame Technology First they tracked our steps, now the robots are taking their own. Dreame\u2019s new X50 Ultra vacuum can push itself up and onto spots that are up to 2.5 inches high with what they\u2019re calling a \u201cmotorized swing arm\u201d (but come on, those are definitely legs). While it\u2019s not ready to climb a set of normal stairs, this is a big leap forward from the robot vacuums that struggle with thick rugs. Baby steps, right? A transparent TV LG Signature OLED T transparent 4K Smart TV. - Screenshot: LG Electronics LG just revealed a television you can literally see through. Their new OLED T switches between regular TV and completely transparent at the press of a button \u2014 when it\u2019s off, it looks like a window. At $60,000, it\u2019s definitely not for everyone (the reviews are having a field day with that price tag). But even the skeptics have to admit there\u2019s something magical about a TV that can transform into a virtual fish tank. However, as The Verge points out , maybe the real question is how long before you get tired of watching your shows through what\u2019s essentially a very expensive window?\u201d This story originally appeared on Quartz, our sister site, on January 9.

This Article: NVDA -2.84% Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang holds a Drive Thor processor during his keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 6, 2025. - Photo: Patrick T. Fallon/AFP (Getty Images) Welcome to CES 2025, where tech companies are showing off their latest innovations \u2014 some more practical than others. From $60,000 transparent TVs to RGB-lit RAM sticks, this year\u2019s show is all about pushing boundaries (and price tags). Let\u2019s take a look at some of the most eye-catching announcements and one fashion moment. Jensen Huang\u2019s new leather jacket Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang holds a personal AI supercomputer during his keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 6, 2025. - Photo: Patrick T. Fallon/AFP (Getty Images) Nvidia\u2019s ( NVDA ) chief executive Jensen Huang walked onto the CES stage for his keynote in his signature style \u2014 a sleek black leather jacket. But this wasn\u2019t just any jacket \u2014 it was a new $8,990 Tom Ford number with an embossed crocodile pattern. During the presentation, he even asked the audience if they liked his latest look. It\u2019s similar \u2014 both in looks and cost \u2014 to one he wore at another tech conference in 2024. But hey, when you run a company worth $3.44 trillion, why not have a new jacket for every event? Colorful DRAM Corsair Custom Lab\u2019s DRAM sticks. - Image: CORSAIR Nvidia\u2019s chief executive wasn\u2019t the only one sporting a new look at CES \u2014 Corsair ( CRSR ) is bringing their Custom Lab creativity to DRAM sticks. They\u2019ve got eight designs, including delicate cherry blossom and futuristic sci-fi light patterns, available in black, white, or gray. These aren\u2019t just DRAM modules with a pretty paint job \u2014 they\u2019re still high-performance memory. Looks like your PC\u2019s memory is ready for its fashion moment. A $1,900 smart ring Ultrahuman\u2019s Rare ring. - Screenshot: Ultrahuman Ultrahuman unveiled a smart ring in 18-karat gold for $1,900 (or $2,200 if you prefer platinum). At a time when other wearables like Humane\u2019s AI Pin are struggling to find their footing, Ultrahuman is betting that luxury shoppers want their health tracking to come with a designer price tag. Functionally, it\u2019s identical to their $350 Ring Air \u2014 but hey, at least this one\u2019s named after desert dunes and comes with a lifetime subscription. A gaming chair that can blast you with hot or cold air Razer\u2019s Project Arielle mesh gaming chair with an integrated fan system. - Image: Razer Razer has a new take on gaming comfort \u2014 their prototype gaming chair can blast you with hot or cold air. And because this is Razer at CES, of course, this temperature-controlled chair needed a dramatic name: Project Arielle. The chair uses a bladeless fan system that can cool you down during intense gaming sessions or warm you up on chilly days. Unlike most of Razer\u2019s wild CES concepts (remember that fold-out triple-screen laptop ?), this one actually seems practical, if a little decadent. Though you\u2019ll have to stay plugged in \u2014 spinning 360 degrees will turn you into a power cable mummy. AI agents that can roast you (or cheer you on) while gaming Streamlabs, Inworld AI, and Nvidia\u2019s AI agent for streaming. - Screenshot: Streamlabs on YouTube Now AI wants to be your gaming buddy \u2014 or your worst critic. Inworld AI and Streamlabs ( LOGI ) are cooking up an \u2018Intelligent Streaming Assistant\u2019 that can hype up your Fortnite victories or, presumably, roast your building skills. It\u2019ll even trigger special effects when you do something impressive, though based on the demo, it looks about as natural as a robot trying to do stand-up comedy. Story Continues Want a sassy AI cohost commenting on your gameplay? Coming to Streamlabs later this year, your mileage may vary depending on your gaming and how able you can handle some heckling. A lamp that doubles as a smart garden LG Electronics\u2019 smart garden standing lamp. - Image: LG Electronics LG ( LPL ) is bringing together two things we never knew we needed combined: a smart lamp and an indoor garden. Their new floor-standing light doubles as a plant sanctuary, with LED lighting that can both nurture your greenery and set the mood. It\u2019s got a clever shelf in the middle for growing up to twenty plants, and a built-in watering system that knows exactly what your leafy friends need. Finally, a smart home gadget that might actually make your home feel more alive \u2014 though, like many of LG\u2019s coolest innovations revealed at CES, there\u2019s no guarantee it\u2019ll make it to stores near you any time soon. Check your temp? Nah, check your hormones Hormometer - Image: Consumer Electronics Show (CES) Tired of just tracking your steps and sleep? The Hormometer wants you to check your hormones, too. It\u2019s a simple stick that uses your saliva and phone camera to measure stress and reproductive hormones like cortisol and progesterone. At $8 a month, it\u2019s way cheaper than traditional lab tests \u2014 though experts are raising eyebrows at the whole \u2018hormone balancing\u2019 trend it\u2019s riding. Still, for anyone dealing with actual hormone-related health issues, having lab-quality results without the lab visit could be a game-changer. A robot vacuum with legs Dreame Technology\u2019s X50 Ultra robot vacuum. - Image: Dreame Technology First they tracked our steps, now the robots are taking their own. Dreame\u2019s new X50 Ultra vacuum can push itself up and onto spots that are up to 2.5 inches high with what they\u2019re calling a \u201cmotorized swing arm\u201d (but come on, those are definitely legs). While it\u2019s not ready to climb a set of normal stairs, this is a big leap forward from the robot vacuums that struggle with thick rugs. Baby steps, right? A transparent TV LG Signature OLED T transparent 4K Smart TV. - Screenshot: LG Electronics LG just revealed a television you can literally see through. Their new OLED T switches between regular TV and completely transparent at the press of a button \u2014 when it\u2019s off, it looks like a window. At $60,000, it\u2019s definitely not for everyone (the reviews are having a field day with that price tag). But even the skeptics have to admit there\u2019s something magical about a TV that can transform into a virtual fish tank. However, as The Verge points out , maybe the real question is how long before you get tired of watching your shows through what\u2019s essentially a very expensive window?\u201d For the latest news, Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .

Plunges 13% YTD: What Should Investors Do? Zacks Equity Research Tue, Dec 31, 2024, 4:46 PM 3 min read Logitech LOGI shares have plunged 13% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Computer Technology sector and the S&P 500\u2019s return of 33.4% and 26.3%, respectively. As an established player in the computer-peripheral space, LOGI\u2019s underperformance is disappointing. This raises an important question for investors: Is it the right time to buy or sell the stock LOGI Grapples With Competitive and Economic Headwinds Logitech has been facing multiple challenges from the weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties to the geopolitical issues in the heart of Europe. The weakened global economy has affected consumer spending, lowering the consumption of consumer electronics, affecting Logitech\u2019s revenues throughout fiscal 2024. Logitech operates in a highly competitive market with big players like Bose, Sony Group SONY, Apple AAPL, Corsair CRSR, Microsoft, Philips, HP, Dell, Cisco and many more. The peripheral market in which Logitech operates is also characterized by short product life cycles forcing Logitech to continuously invest in new product capabilities, giving rise to its operating expenses. Additionally, LOGI\u2019s marketing and selling costs have been on a rising trend for the past eight quarters. The pointing device market where Logitech is a leader, also has other strong players like HP and Dell. On the other hand, Sony, Bose and Corsair have their impressive lineup of headsets and Cisco competes with Logitech in the webcam market. These brands constantly pose a direct threat to Logitech with their launch of new products, pricing pressure and promotional campaigns. These factors also force Logitech to take in aggressive marketing tactics. Moreover, the peripheral market also faces indirect competition from the growing popularity of smaller and mobile computing devices with touch interfaces, which is diminishing the demand for desktop PCs. As Logitech mainly serves the PC-oriented peripheral product market, the rise in popularity of touch interface-based products is posing a headwind to its product lines. Logitech Price Performance Chart Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Strong Portfolio Aids LOGI\u2019s Recovery Despite headwinds, Logitech's revenues are recovering as it navigates challenges with innovative product launches. Throughout 2024, Logitech has launched several innovative audio equipment, webcams, headsets, pointing devices, keyboards and other consumer electronic devices. Logitech\u2019s audio equipment product launches include the EVERBOOM portable speaker with 360\u00b0 sound, EPICBOOM Bluetooth speaker, Logitech G ASTRO A50 X LIGHTSPEED wireless headset, Zone Wireless 2 headsets for work and software like Streamline plugin for Loupedeck users.

Story Continues Andy Paul, Chief Executive Officer of Corsair, stated, \"Our Gaming Components and Systems business segment continues to show challenging results, as we near the end of the latest technology cycle of GPU cards. We believe the industry is gearing up for a strong 2025, with new Nvidia GPU cards expected to be launched in Q1, and we believe that we will see the beginning of a significant refresh cycle from the COVID lockdown surge of system builds. In the meantime, we remain a market leader in gaming components and systems, and are focused on improving efficiencies where we can across the business and working to increase profitability in our newer products. PC gaming as an activity continues to grow, and we can see that from the industry reports of headset sales, which are substantially higher than pre-pandemic levels, and are now showing growth from last year. We continue to gain positive momentum in our Gamer and Creator Peripherals segment, with 13% revenue growth on a year over year basis in the third quarter of 2024 and continued strong margins reaching 38.3% in Q3 2024. This is where most of our M&A activity is focused and we were pleased to recently announce that we completed our acquisition of the Fanatec business from Endor AG. We believe this will greatly accelerate our recent entry into the large and rapidly growing Sim Racing market. In addition, with our new Chassis, Gaming PCs, Monitors and Fanatec steering wheels, wheel bases and pedals, we have a full end-to-end solution. We are working hard on the integration of Fanatec, which we expect to have substantially completed by Q2 2025. We expect revenue in Q4 2024 will be EBITDA neutral, but are confident that business will be profitable in 2025, with Fanatec having the potential to drive meaningful revenue growth over the coming years. Overall, we expect 2025 to be a strong year with expected continued growth from Gaming and Sim Racing and a strong rebound from our components product lines.\" Michael G. Potter, Chief Financial Officer of Corsair, stated, \"We were able to use our strong balance sheet to complete the Fanatec business acquisition, which we expect will be a significant long-term growth driver similar to what we have achieved with other highly successful segment leading acquisitions we have previously integrated and grown. We also increased our investment in our majority owned, key supplier for our industry leading Stream Deck family of products, which has helped us to achieve higher margins in one of our fastest growing product areas. We believe that Q2 through Q3 2024 was the trough for revenue and margins for our Gaming Components and Systems segment and we are seeing progress towards a recovery in Q4 2024. We exited the quarter with a healthy cash position and our revolver fully available. This is a result of our focus on ensuring we could invest in growth opportunities, while also reducing debt in a steady manner. In reaction to this year\u2019s slower than expected recovery industrywide, we have taken additional cost saving actions, including a targeted workforce reduction to better align our resources with the current business environment. With these cost saving actions, we made deliberate decisions to not impact product development or revenue generating areas so that we can meet higher anticipated demand when the new GPUs are released to the market. We expect our cost saving measures to result in several millions of dollars of savings per quarter, which will start to ramp in Q4 2024. We also expect to steadily improve EBITDA margins as we return to a path to hit high single digits there.\" Updated 2024 Financial Outlook Corsair updated its financial outlook for the full year 2024. The Company continues to expect revenue to improve through 2024, with a further improvement in adjusted EBITDA led by an additional improvement in margin, stabilized shipping costs and continued tight operating expense controls. The Company reiterated its expectation for revenue for the full year 2024 to be in the range of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion, including approximately $20 million of EBITDA-neutral revenue in Q4 2024 from its recent Fanatec acquisition. Adjusted operating income is now expected to be in the range of $28 million to $43 million, compared to $48 million to $63 million previously. Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $40 million to $55 million, compared to $60 million to $75 million previously. Certain non-GAAP measures included in our financial outlook were not reconciled to the comparable GAAP financial measures because the GAAP measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis. We are unable to reconcile these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts because we are currently unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the type and extent of certain items that would be expected to impact GAAP measures for these periods but would not impact the non-GAAP measures. Such items may include stock-based compensation charges, amortization, and other items. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on our GAAP financial results. The foregoing forward-looking statements reflect our expectations as of today\u2019s date. Given the number of risk factors, uncertainties and assumptions discussed below, actual results may differ materially. We do not intend to update our financial outlook until our next quarterly results announcement.

Forward-looking statements are based on our management\u2019s beliefs, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to them. Because such statements are based on expectations as to future financial and operating results and are not statements of fact, actual results may differ materially from those projected. Factors which may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to: current macroeconomic conditions, including the impacts of high inflation and risk of recession, on demand for our products, consumer confidence and financial markets generally; the lingering impacts and future outbreaks of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on our operations and the operations of our manufacturers, retailers and other partners, as well as its impacts on the economy overall, including capital markets; our ability to build and maintain the strength of our brand among gaming and streaming enthusiasts and our ability to continuously develop and successfully market new products and improvements to existing products; the introduction and success of new third-party high-performance computer hardware, particularly graphics processing units and central processing units as well as sophisticated new video games; fluctuations in operating results; the risk that we are not able to compete with competitors and/or that the gaming industry, including streaming and esports, does not grow as expected or declines; the loss or inability to attract and retain key management; the impacts from geopolitical events and unrest; delays or disruptions at our or third-parties\u2019 manufacturing and distribution facilities; the risk that we are not able to successfully identify and close acquisitions, as well as integrate any companies or assets we have acquired or may acquire; currency exchange rate fluctuations or international trade disputes resulting in our products becoming relatively more expensive to our overseas customers or resulting in an increase in our manufacturing costs; and the other factors described under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and our subsequent filings with the SEC. Copies of each filing may be obtained from us or the SEC. All forward-looking statements reflect our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this press release. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances. Our results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 are also not necessarily indicative of our operating results for any future periods. Use and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement the financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, this earnings release presents certain non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA. These are important financial performance measures for us, but are not financial measures as defined by GAAP. The presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation of or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per share and adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our operating performance and trends and make planning decisions. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses and other items that we exclude in such non-GAAP measures. Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allowing for greater transparency with respect to the key financial metrics used by our management in our financial and operational decision-making. We also present these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe investors, analysts and rating agencies consider it useful in measuring our ability to meet our debt service obligations. Our use of these terms may vary from that of others in our industry. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net revenue, operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash provided by operating activities, or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance or liquidity. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are presented in the attached schedules. We calculate these non-GAAP financial measures as follows: Adjusted operating income (loss), non-GAAP, is determined by adding back to GAAP operating income (loss), the impact from amortization, stock-based compensation, one-time costs related to legal and other matters, acquisition and related integration costs, restructuring and other charges, and acquisition accounting impact related to recognizing acquired inventory at fair value. Adjusted net income (loss), non-GAAP, is determined by adding back to GAAP net income (loss), the impact from amortization, stock-based compensation, one-time costs related to legal and other matters, acquisition and related integration costs, restructuring and other charges, acquisition accounting impact related to recognizing acquired inventory at fair value, and the related tax effects of each of these adjustments. Adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share, non-GAAP, is determined by dividing adjusted net income (loss), non-GAAP by the respective weighted average shares outstanding, inclusive of the impact of other dilutive securities. Adjusted EBITDA is determined by adding back to GAAP net income (loss), the impact from amortization, stock-based compensation, one-time costs related to legal and other matters, depreciation, interest expense, net, acquisition and related integration costs, restructuring and other charges, acquisition accounting impact related to recognizing acquired inventory at fair value, and tax expense (benefit). We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the related GAAP financial measures.

The company has shown 17% growth in its gaming peripherals segment year-to-date, outperforming market trends. Corsair Gaming Inc ( NASDAQ:CRSR ) has launched several new products, including the Virtuoso Max headset and small form factor keyboards, which have received positive market feedback. The acquisition of Fanatec is expected to add approximately $20 million to Q4 2024 revenue and positions Corsair Gaming Inc ( NASDAQ:CRSR ) in the growing sim racing market. Corsair Gaming Inc ( NASDAQ:CRSR ) has been selected as the exclusive launch partner for the Call of Duty Black Ops Six title, enhancing its brand visibility and market reach. Negative Points Corsair Gaming Inc ( NASDAQ:CRSR ) reported a decrease in net revenue for Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023, with a notable decline in the gaming components and systems segment. The company experienced a GAAP operating loss of $20.9 million in Q3 2024, compared to a smaller loss in the same quarter of the previous year. Gross margins decreased in the gaming components and systems segment, impacting overall profitability. Corsair Gaming Inc ( NASDAQ:CRSR ) has revised its full-year 2024 adjusted EBITDA expectations downward, reflecting challenges in achieving previous financial targets.

Story Continues Q & A Highlights Q : Can you elaborate on the EBITDA margin improvement plan and any specific measures to enhance profitability? A : Andy Paul, CEO: We anticipate a big year with game and technology launches driving sales of higher-margin products. Our peripheral business, which has higher margins, continues to grow and now contributes more to our gross margin than our components and memory segments. Michael Potter, CFO: We've adjusted our operating expenses to align with lower revenue levels, so as revenue increases, more gross profit will contribute to the bottom line. Q : How has consumer demand changed compared to three months ago, and what are your thoughts on the upcoming GPU refresh? A : Andy Paul, CEO: We saw record sales during Amazon Prime Day, indicating strong consumer interest in gaming gear. Retailers are now more confident, leading to better bookings for the holiday season and Q1. We expect a lot of refreshes as peripherals and graphics cards become outdated. Q : Regarding your updated guidance, how much of the change is due to Q3 performance versus Q4 expectations? A : Michael Potter, CFO: Most of the change is due to a Q3 shortfall, particularly in gross margin percentage for components and systems. There is some conservatism in Q4 numbers, but the main impact was from Q3. Q : Can you update us on the Stream Deck marketplace and its potential as a revenue stream in 2025? A : Andy Paul, CEO: The marketplace has over a million accounts and drives hardware sales. While software sales revenue is currently insignificant, we expect it to grow as we introduce more compelling apps. Q : What are your expectations for the components and memory business in 2025, especially with the new GPU launch? A : Andy Paul, CEO: We expect a rebound as the market stabilizes post-COVID. The upcoming GPU launch should drive upgrades from older series, leading to more consistent growth. Q : How is your channel inventory positioned for the holidays, and what are your expectations? A : Andy Paul, CEO: We were under-inventoried mid-year, but retailers are now leaning in, expecting a strong holiday season. The anticipated NVIDIA GPU launch is also driving confidence in the market. Q : Beyond product refresh cycles, what gives you confidence in underlying industry demand? A : Andy Paul, CEO: The Sim Racing market is growing, and we plan to leverage our complete system offerings. Our Elgato and peripheral segments are also expanding with new products and market opportunities. Q : What are your product development plans for 2025, and which categories will you focus on? A : Andy Paul, CEO: We are focusing on Sim Racing, professional broadcast solutions, and expanding our peripheral offerings.
