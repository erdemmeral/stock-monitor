For Immediate Release Chicago, IL \u2013 December 26, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: ADMA Biologics, Inc. ADMA, Tarsus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. TARS, Stoke Therapeutics, Inc. STOK and ChromaDex Corp. CDXC. Here are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog: 4 Drug, Biotech Stocks Up More than +50% in 2024, with Room to Grow The biotech sector witnessed a see-saw performance in 2024. While the year started on a positive note, much of the gains slowed down in the second half of 2024. The downside in the second half was due to overall disappointing third-quarter results, guidance cuts and pipeline setbacks. The sector has declined 9.5% in the past six months, underperforming the S&P 500 index. Nonetheless, given the continuous need for innovative medicines, the biotech industry will continue to grab investors' interest despite the inherent volatility and uncertain macroeconomic environment. Innovation is likely to drive growth in the industry, with key spaces like obesity and oncology drugs attracting attention. M&A activity should remain strong in 2025. Overall fundamentals of the sector remain strong and investors are expected to come back to this space eventually. Here, we discuss four biotech stocks that have returned 50% or more year to date and have room for more growth in 2025 on the back of a solid portfolio and a promising pipeline. These are ADMA Biologics, Inc. , Tarsus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. , Stoke Therapeutics, Inc. and ChromaDex Corp. . The stocks have outperformed the industry this year. ADMA Biologics ADMA Biologics markets plasma-derived biologics for treating immune deficiencies and preventing certain infectious diseases. The company's top line currently comprises sales of three FDA-approved products \u2014 Bivigam (an Intravenous Immune Globulin [\"IVIG\"] product to treat primary humoral immunodeficiency), Asceniv (to treat primary immunodeficiency disease or PIDD) and Nabi-HB (to treat and provide enhanced immunity against the hepatitis B virus). Asceniv is a plasma-derived IVIG that contains naturally occurring polyclonal antibodies. Its strong sales growth is driving the top line. The ongoing post-marketing study for Asceniv may provide a label expansion opportunity to include pediatric-aged PI patients. A potential label expansion of Asceniv should drive near-term revenue growth. Story Continues The company is working to increase Asceniv's supply. If successful, Asceniv will account for a significant portion of ADMA's total revenues over time, further advancing its potential margin expansion and earnings growth. ADMA has put up a stellar performance in 2024, buoyed by strong quarterly performances and a consecutive increase in guidance. Shares have skyrocketed 292% so far in 2024. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here . Estimates for ADMA's 2025 earnings per share have increased from 64 cents to 78 cents over the past 60 days. Tarsus Pharmaceuticals Tarsus Pharmaceuticals currently markets Xdemvy (lotilaner ophthalmic solution) 0.25%, a novel eye drop approved for treating Demodex blepharitis. The eye drop was approved by the FDA in 2023 and has witnessed a robust sales uptake so far. Xdemvy generated sales worth $113.7 million in the first nine months of 2024. Around 104,400 bottles of Xdemvy were delivered to patients during the same time. Per management, Xdemvy launch continues to accelerate owing to growth in prescription volumes. The company's robust pipeline includes TP-04 for treating rosacea and TP-05, a tablet for preventing Lyme disease. Both candidates are currently in phase II development. TARS remains focused on engaging with the FDA for the regulatory path ahead for TP-04 and TP-05 shortly. TARS has put up a strong performance, with shares rallying 168.7% so far in 2024. Positive regulatory updates and good pipeline progress should keep the stock afloat in 2025. TARS currently carries a Zacks Rank 2. Loss per share estimates for 2025 have narrowed from $2.10 to $1.43 in the past 60 days. Stoke Therapeutics Clinical stage biotech, Stoke Therapeutics is developing its investigational candidate, zorevunersen (STK-001), for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, a severe and progressive genetic epilepsy. Zorevunersen is a novel proprietary antisense oligonucleotide with the potential to become the first disease-modifying therapy to address the genetic cause of Dravet syndrome. Zorevunersen is currently being evaluated in phase I/IIa and open-label extension (OLE) studies for the treatment of Dravet syndrome. Earlier this month, the FDA granted a Breakthrough Therapy designation to zorevunersen for treating Dravet syndrome. STOK is currently discussing the path for a global phase III registrational study of zorevunersen in Dravet syndrome with the FDA and other regulatory agencies worldwide. An update on the phase III registrational study on zorevunersen is expected shortly. STOK put up a strong performance in 2024, with shares rallying 120.7% year to date. A positive regulatory update and successful development of zorevunersen should help the stock gain further in 2025. STOK currently carries a Zacks Rank 2. Loss per share estimates for 2025 have narrowed from $2.59 to $2.49 in the past 60 days. ChromaDex ChromaDex currently markets Niagen as the most efficient and superior-quality NAD+ booster, which is available in several countries, including the United States. CDXC delivers Niagen as the sole active ingredient in its dietary supplement consumer product, Tru Niagen. The company's top line is currently being driven by a strong Niagen ingredient business as well as growth in the e-commerce business. Building on this momentum, management expects accelerated growth in 2025. ChromaDex is developing its investigational candidate, nicotinamide riboside chloride (NRC) to treat ataxia telangiectasia (AT), a rare and progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes severe disability (premature aging). The company has already had a discussion with the FDA to pursue an investigational new drug (IND) application for NRC. Subject to IND clearance by the FDA, CDXC will begin evaluating the candidate in human clinical studies. The FDA has granted Orphan Drug designation and Rare Pediatric Disease designation to NRC for treating AT. CDXC put up a staggering performance in 2024, with shares rallying 270.6% so far in 2024. The strong performance of the global e-commerce business, launch of new products and good pipeline progress should help the stock gain further. CDXC currently carries a Zacks Rank 2. Estimates for 2025 earnings per share have increased from 9 cents to 12 cents over the past 60 days. Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Corporation (CDXC) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run? Zacks Equity Research Fri, Nov 22, 2024, 5:15 PM 4 min read In This Article: CDXC JAZZ Have you been paying attention to shares of ChromaDex (CDXC) ? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 122.5% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $7.85 in the previous session. ChromaDex has gained 433.6% since the start of the year compared to the -0.2% move for the Zacks Medical sector and the -8.2% return for the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry. What's Driving the Outperformance? The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on October 31, 2024, ChromaDex reported EPS of $0.02 versus consensus estimate of $0.01 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 7.93%. For the current fiscal year, ChromaDex is expected to post earnings of $0.04 per share on $97.55 million in revenues. This represents a 157.14% change in EPS on a 16.73% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $0.12 per share on $120.8 million in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 200% and 23.83%, respectively. Valuation Metrics ChromaDex may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level. On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style. ChromaDex has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B. In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 190.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 22.8X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 5X versus its peer group's average of 14.6X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective. Zacks Rank We also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, ChromaDex currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts. Story Continues Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if ChromaDex passes the test. Thus, it seems as though ChromaDex shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term. How Does CDXC Stack Up to the Competition? Shares of CDXC have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Jazz Pharmaceuticals PLC (JAZZ) . JAZZ has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of C. Earnings were strong last quarter. Jazz Pharmaceuticals PLC beat our consensus estimate by 20.84%, and for the current fiscal year, JAZZ is expected to post earnings of $22.16 per share on revenue of $4.04 billion. Shares of Jazz Pharmaceuticals PLC have gained 15.8% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 6.24X and a P/CF of 4.5X. The Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry is in the top 25% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for CDXC and JAZZ, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.

Stocks Rising More Than 50% in 2024 With Room to Grow Zacks Equity Research Tue, Dec 24, 2024, 7:49 PM 5 min read In This Article: CDXC TARS ADMA STOK The biotech sector witnessed a see-saw performance in 2024. While the year started on a positive note, much of the gains slowed down in the second half of 2024. The downside in the second half was due to overall disappointing third-quarter results, guidance cuts and pipeline setbacks. The sector has declined 9.5% in the past six months, underperforming the S&P 500 index, as seen in the chart below. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Nonetheless, given the continuous need for innovative medicines, the biotech industry will continue to grab investors\u2019 interest despite the inherent volatility and uncertain macroeconomic environment. Innovation is likely to drive growth in the industry, with key spaces like obesity and oncology drugs attracting attention. M&A activity should remain strong in 2025. Overall fundamentals of the sector remain strong and investors are expected to come back to this space eventually. Here, we discuss four biotech stocks that have returned 50% or more year to date and have room for more growth in 2025 on the back of a solid portfolio and a promising pipeline. These are ADMA Biologics, Inc. ADMA, Tarsus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. TARS, Stoke Therapeutics, Inc. STOK and ChromaDex Corporation CDXC. The stocks have outperformed the industry this year, as seen in the chart below: Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research ADMA Biologics ADMA Biologics markets plasma-derived biologics for treating immune deficiencies and preventing certain infectious diseases. The company\u2019s top line currently comprises sales of three FDA-approved products \u2014 Bivigam (an Intravenous Immune Globulin [\u201cIVIG\u201d] product to treat primary humoral immunodeficiency), Asceniv (to treat primary immunodeficiency disease or PIDD) and Nabi-HB (to treat and provide enhanced immunity against the hepatitis B virus). Asceniv is a plasma-derived IVIG that contains naturally occurring polyclonal antibodies. Its strong sales growth is driving the top line. The ongoing post-marketing study for Asceniv may provide a label expansion opportunity to include pediatric-aged PI patients. A potential label expansion of Asceniv should drive near-term revenue growth. The company is working to increase Asceniv's supply. If successful, Asceniv will account for a significant portion of ADMA's total revenues over time, further advancing its potential margin expansion and earnings growth. ADMA has put up a stellar performance in 2024, buoyed by strong quarterly performances and a consecutive increase in guidance. Shares have skyrocketed 292% so far in 2024. Story Continues The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here . Estimates for ADMA\u2019s 2025 earnings per share have increased from 64 cents to 78 cents over the past 60 days. Tarsus Pharmaceuticals Tarsus Pharmaceuticals currently markets Xdemvy (lotilaner ophthalmic solution) 0.25%, a novel eye drop approved for treating Demodex blepharitis. The eye drop was approved by the FDA in 2023 and has witnessed a robust sales uptake so far. Xdemvy generated sales worth $113.7 million in the first nine months of 2024. Around 104,400 bottles of Xdemvy were delivered to patients during the same time. Per management, Xdemvy launch continues to accelerate owing to growth in prescription volumes. The company\u2019s robust pipeline includes TP-04 for treating rosacea and TP-05, a tablet for preventing Lyme disease. Both candidates are currently in phase II development. TARS remains focused on engaging with the FDA for the regulatory path ahead for TP-04 and TP-05 shortly. TARS has put up a strong performance, with shares rallying 168.7% so far in 2024. Positive regulatory updates and good pipeline progress should keep the stock afloat in 2025. TARS currently carries a Zacks Rank 2. Loss per share estimates for 2025 have narrowed from $2.10 to $1.43 in the past 60 days. Stoke Therapeutics Clinical stage biotech, Stoke Therapeutics is developing its investigational candidate, zorevunersen (STK-001), for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, a severe and progressive genetic epilepsy. Zorevunersen is a novel proprietary antisense oligonucleotide with the potential to become the first disease-modifying therapy to address the genetic cause of Dravet syndrome. Zorevunersen is currently being evaluated in phase I/IIa and open-label extension (OLE) studies for the treatment of Dravet syndrome. Earlier this month, the FDA granted a Breakthrough Therapy designation to zorevunersen for treating Dravet syndrome. STOK is currently discussing the path for a global phase III registrational study of zorevunersen in Dravet syndrome with the FDA and other regulatory agencies worldwide. An update on the phase III registrational study on zorevunersen is expected shortly. STOK put up a strong performance in 2024, with shares rallying 120.7% year to date. A positive regulatory update and successful development of zorevunersen should help the stock gain further in 2025. STOK currently carries a Zacks Rank 2. Loss per share estimates for 2025 have narrowed from $2.59 to $2.49 in the past 60 days. ChromaDex ChromaDex currently markets Niagen as the most efficient and superior-quality NAD+ booster, which is available in several countries, including the United States. CDXC delivers Niagen as the sole active ingredient in its dietary supplement consumer product, Tru Niagen. The company\u2019s top line is currently being driven by a strong Niagen ingredient business as well as growth in the e-commerce business. Building on this momentum, management expects accelerated growth in 2025. ChromaDex is developing its investigational candidate, nicotinamide riboside chloride (NRC) to treat ataxia telangiectasia (AT), a rare and progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes severe disability (premature aging). The company has already had a discussion with the FDA to pursue an investigational new drug (IND) application for NRC. Subject to IND clearance by the FDA, CDXC will begin evaluating the candidate in human clinical studies. The FDA has granted Orphan Drug designation and Rare Pediatric Disease designation to NRC for treating AT. CDXC put up a staggering performance in 2024, with shares rallying 270.6% so far in 2024. The strong performance of the global e-commerce business, launch of new products and good pipeline progress should help the stock gain further. CDXC currently carries a Zacks Rank 2. Estimates for 2025 earnings per share have increased from 9 cents to 12 cents over the past 60 days. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

{"text": "Even though ChromaDex (NASDAQ:CDXC) has lost US$73m market cap in last 7 days, shareholders are still up 389% over 1 year editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Tue, Dec 10, 2024, 1:42 PM 3 min read In This Article: CDXC It's been a soft week for ChromaDex Corporation ( NASDAQ:CDXC ) shares, which are down 13%. But that isn't a problem when you consider how the share price has soared over the last year. In fact, it is up 389% in that time. So it is not that surprising to see the stock retrace a little. Of course, winners often do keep winning, so there may be more gains to come (if the business fundamentals stack up). Although ChromaDex has shed US$73m from its market cap this week, let's take a look at its longer term fundamental trends and see if they've driven returns. Check out our latest analysis for ChromaDex We don't think that ChromaDex's modest trailing twelve month profit has the market's full attention at the moment. We think revenue is probably a better guide. As a general rule, we think this kind of company is more comparable to loss-making stocks, since the actual profit is so low. For shareholders to have confidence a company will grow profits significantly, it must grow revenue. In the last year ChromaDex saw its revenue grow by 10.0%. That's not great considering the company is losing money. So it's truly surprising that the share price rocketed 389% in a single year. It's great to see that some have made big profits, but we aren't so sure that the increase is justified. This is an example of the huge profits some lucky shareholders occasionally make on growth stocks. You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). NasdaqCM:CDXC Earnings and Revenue Growth December 10th 2024 We're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. If you are thinking of buying or selling ChromaDex stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts . A Different Perspective It's good to see that ChromaDex has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 389% in the last twelve months. That's better than the annualised return of 9% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified 1 warning sign for ChromaDex that you should be aware of.

(CDXC) is on the Move, Here's Why the Trend Could be Sustainable Zacks Equity Research Mon, Dec 9, 2024, 4:50 PM 3 min read When it comes to short-term investing or trading, they say \"the trend is your friend.\" And there's no denying that this is the most profitable strategy. But making sure of the sustainability of a trend to profit from it is easier said than done. Often, the direction of a stock's price movement reverses quickly after taking a position in it, making investors incur a short-term capital loss. So, it's important to ensure that there are enough factors -- such as sound fundamentals, positive earnings estimate revisions, etc. -- that could keep the momentum in the stock going. Our \"Recent Price Strength\" screen, which is created on a unique short-term trading strategy, could be pretty useful in this regard. This predefined screen makes it really easy to shortlist the stocks that have enough fundamental strength to maintain their recent uptrend. Also, the screen passes only the stocks that are trading in the upper portion of their 52-week high-low range, which is usually an indicator of bullishness. There are several stocks that passed through the screen and ChromaDex (CDXC) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a solid choice for \"trend\" investing. A solid price increase over a period of 12 weeks reflects investors' continued willingness to pay more for the potential upside in a stock. CDXC is quite a good fit in this regard, gaining 89.3% over this period. However, it's not enough to look at the price change for around three months, as it doesn't reflect any trend reversal that might have happened in a shorter time frame. It's important for a potential winner to maintain the price trend. A price increase of 3.4% over the past four weeks ensures that the trend is still in place for the stock of this natural products company. Moreover, CDXC is currently trading at 81.2% of its 52-week High-Low Range, hinting that it can be on the verge of a breakout. Looking at the fundamentals, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises -- the key factors that impact a stock's near-term price movements. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> Story Continues Another factor that confirms the company's fundamental strength is its Average Broker Recommendation of #1 (Strong Buy). This indicates that the brokerage community is highly optimistic about the stock's near-term price performance. So, the price trend in CDXC may not reverse anytime soon. In addition to CDXC, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our \"Recent Price Strength\" screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria. This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market. However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

CDXC ChromaDex Corporation's ( NASDAQ:CDXC ) strong earnings report was rewarded with a positive stock price move. Our analysis found some more factors that we think are good for shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for ChromaDex NasdaqCM:CDXC Earnings and Revenue History November 7th 2024 Zooming In On ChromaDex's Earnings Many investors haven't heard of the accrual ratio from cashflow , but it is actually a useful measure of how well a company's profit is backed up by free cash flow (FCF) during a given period. To get the accrual ratio we first subtract FCF from profit for a period, and then divide that number by the average operating assets for the period. You could think of the accrual ratio from cashflow as the 'non-FCF profit ratio'. Therefore, it's actually considered a good thing when a company has a negative accrual ratio, but a bad thing if its accrual ratio is positive. While having an accrual ratio above zero is of little concern, we do think it's worth noting when a company has a relatively high accrual ratio. That's because some academic studies have suggested that high accruals ratios tend to lead to lower profit or less profit growth. For the year to September 2024, ChromaDex had an accrual ratio of -1.83. That implies it has very good cash conversion, and that its earnings in the last year actually significantly understate its free cash flow. In fact, it had free cash flow of US$4.1m in the last year, which was a lot more than its statutory profit of US$1.49m. ChromaDex's free cash flow actually declined over the last year, which is disappointing, like non-biodegradable balloons. That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates. Our Take On ChromaDex's Profit Performance Happily for shareholders, ChromaDex produced plenty of free cash flow to back up its statutory profit numbers. Because of this, we think ChromaDex's underlying earnings potential is as good as, or possibly even better, than the statutory profit makes it seem! And it's also positive that the company showed enough improvement to book a profit this year, after losing money last year. The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider. So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing ChromaDex at this point in time. You'd be interested to know, that we found 1 warning sign for ChromaDex and you'll want to know about this. Story Continues Today we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of ChromaDex's profit. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company. For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying.

(CDXC) is Your Friend, Here's Why Zacks Equity Research Thu, Nov 21, 2024, 4:50 PM 3 min read Most of us have heard the dictum \"the trend is your friend.\" And this is undeniably the key to success when it comes to short-term investing or trading. But it isn't easy to ensure the sustainability of a trend and profit from it. The trend often reverses before exiting the trade, leading to a short-term capital loss for investors. So, for a profitable trade, one should confirm factors such as sound fundamentals, positive earnings estimate revisions, etc. that could keep the momentum in the stock alive. Investors looking to make a profit from stocks that are currently on the move may find our \"Recent Price Strength\" screen pretty useful. This predefined screen comes handy in spotting stocks that are on an uptrend backed by strength in their fundamentals, and trading in the upper portion of their 52-week high-low range, which is usually an indicator of bullishness. There are several stocks that passed through the screen and ChromaDex (CDXC) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a solid choice for \"trend\" investing. A solid price increase over a period of 12 weeks reflects investors' continued willingness to pay more for the potential upside in a stock. CDXC is quite a good fit in this regard, gaining 122.6% over this period. However, it's not enough to look at the price change for around three months, as it doesn't reflect any trend reversal that might have happened in a shorter time frame. It's important for a potential winner to maintain the price trend. A price increase of 116.8% over the past four weeks ensures that the trend is still in place for the stock of this natural products company. Moreover, CDXC is currently trading at 97.3% of its 52-week High-Low Range, hinting that it can be on the verge of a breakout. Looking at the fundamentals, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises -- the key factors that impact a stock's near-term price movements. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> Another factor that confirms the company's fundamental strength is its Average Broker Recommendation of #1 (Strong Buy). This indicates that the brokerage community is highly optimistic about the stock's near-term price performance. Story Continues So, the price trend in CDXC may not reverse anytime soon. In addition to CDXC, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our \"Recent Price Strength\" screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria. This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick.
