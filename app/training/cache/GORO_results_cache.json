Guests including Pusha T, Travis Scott, ASAP Nast, Takashi Murakami, Eric Nam, Rowoon and Im Si-wan braved pouring rain to gather at chef Nobu\u2019s Matsuhisa restaurant at the Royal Monceau Raffles Paris hotel to toast the duo, who were already chowing down at the table of honor as guests arrived. More from WWD A Closer Look at the Novelties of LVMH Watch Week in New York Takashi Murakami, JP the Wavy Talk Travel Essentials at Rick Owens Adrien Brody and Georgina Chapman Are a Coordinated Couple in Monochromatic Looks at Louis Vuitton Men's Fall 2025 Paris Fashion Show The sale organized by Joopiter, the auction platform that Williams launched in 2022 , features some of the items that were presented in glass display cases on the Vuitton runway, in a fresh convergence between the entertainer\u2019s various ventures. \u201cThis is like a dream come true for us,\u201d said Caitlin Donovan, head of global sales at Joopiter. The items included a brown version of Williams\u2019 signature Vivienne Westwood Buffalo hat; a Jacob & Co. gemstone necklace estimated at $800,000 to $1 million, and a set of multicolored plastic ice cream cones created to celebrate the opening of the duo\u2019s Billionaire Boys Club store in Japan in 2006. The dual \u201c Nigo Knows\u201d and \u201cPharrell Knows Too\u201d sales, which run from Friday until Feb. 5, also offer a glimpse of Nigo\u2019s passion for collecting everything from Goyard monogram canvas items to vintage Beatles posters and jewelry by cult Japanese designer Goro Takahashi. Tyrod Taylor and Pusha T Pusha T walked in Williams\u2019 debut show for Vuitton and was named an ambassador of the French luxury house in July. \u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling in just how LV has really opened their doors and opened their resources up to me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just been super strong watching just how open they are to the legacy of what we\u2019ve all been a part of for, I guess it\u2019s 25 years now, with Pharrell, Nigo, and just everything we\u2019ve been putting in, all the influence and all the different things we\u2019ve been putting into the fashion space. It\u2019s great to see it come to fruition,\u201d he added. The \u201cNosetalgia\u201d rapper has just put the finishing touches to Clipse\u2019s first album in 15 years, produced by Williams. What can fans of the duo expect? \u201cOh man, more incredible, full-body, cohesive, lyric-driven hip-hop,\u201d he said. It turns out Pusha T is also a collector, though his obsession is Rolex watches (he has more than 20 at last count). \u201cMy favorite is usually my newest, which is the platinum presidential with sapphires. I\u2019m actually wearing it,\u201d he said, pushing up his sleeve to reveal his glittering Day-Date timepiece. Story Continues Travis Scott Scott has been cooking up a new fashion venture of his own. The \u201cSicko Mode\u201d rapper\u2019s Cactus Jack label has collaborated with Nike on a new golf collection, which was previewed at the third edition of the annual Celebrity Golf Classic hosted by Reggie Jackson\u2019s Mr. October Foundation and the Cactus Jack Foundation. Scott has hit the links with everyone from professional golfer Brooks Koepka to fellow aficionado Mark Wahlberg, and has decided to do something about the golf dad outfits he\u2019s been seeing. \u201cI\u2019m into something more fire for the dads, because, like, I\u2019m a dad too,\u201d he said, referring to Stormi and Aire Webster, his children with ex Kylie Jenner. \u201cI\u2019ve just been working for the last couple of years and just figuring out, like, the ill technology that they use on a day-to-day basis, and just trying to match it with cool design.\u201d Manny Jacinto was fresh off shooting \u201cLove Language,\u201d a romantic comedy costarring Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, and will be seen this summer in the eagerly awaited \u201cFreaky Friday\u201d sequel \u201cFreakier Friday\u201d alongside the stars of the 2003 version of the film, Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan. He was doing his best to keep details of his role under wraps. \u201cIf you do some research online, Jamie may have spilled some things that she shouldn\u2019t have spilled, so let\u2019s say: \u2018love interest,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve been hearing from our director and producers, it\u2019s testing really well, and people are really liking it. I think it\u2019s a good ode and testament to the old \u2018Freaky Friday,\u2019 but at the same time having its own twist,\u201d he continued. Manny Jacinto He paid tribute to residents battling the wildfires in Los Angeles, which have caused widespread destruction and killed at least 27 people. \u201cIt\u2019s a wild time there right now, and just like thinking about that movie and that experience just brings me a lot of gratitude because we were able to do it during that time before all this really happened,\u201d he said. Jacinto planned to take in the Herm\u00e8s and Sacai shows in Paris before plotting his next steps. The Filipino Canadian actor, who played The Stranger in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d series \u201cThe Acolyte,\u201d would love to star in a period piece and hopes to bring his own projects to the big screen. \u201cThere\u2019s some Filipino stories that I\u2019m trying to produce and get made,\u201d he said. French artist JR, meanwhile, was gearing up for an exhibition in London to mark the opening of Emmanuel Perrotin\u2019s first gallery there. It will feature work from his \u201cD\u00e9plac\u00e9\u2219e\u2219s\u201d project which highlights people in crisis zones and refugee camps. \u201cIt\u2019s a project that I\u2019ve been doing for years and that I continue to carry out all around the world. There was an exhibition in Stockholm which has just ended and so I am very happy to open one in London in March,\u201d he said. Among the lots in the Joopiter sale were so-called \u201cmystery boxes\u201d from Murakami, Futura 2000 and Daniel Arsham. \u201cRecently, we were looking through the archive of Nigo. There were some pieces that were unopened that were gifted to him many years ago,\u201d Donovan explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a mystery what\u2019s in them, and so that was the idea. I love the concept of these inspirational, influential artists, but not knowing what it is.\u201d Asked what his boxes contained, Murakami gave a shrug and said he didn\u2019t know. \u201cThat\u2019s why \u2018mystery,\u2019\u201d he said with a laugh.

Hands-On: The Next Act In Gaming\u2019s Greatest Variety Show Kenneth Shepard Thu, Jan 16, 2025, 8:00 PM 5 min read Screenshot: RGG Studio / Kotaku As someone who has only casually engaged with the Yakuza / Like a Dragon series, I\u2019m fascinated with its ability to sway in and out of different genres and subgenres while still maintaining the wacky soap-opera core that has made it so beloved. Yakuza has shapeshifted from a crime drama beat-em-up to a turn-based RPG , a spy thriller , and a historical samurai tale , and as the series continues to swap genres like clothes, it\u2019s starting to feel almost like a variety show, with its core cast taking on new personas all while maintaining the same soul. Now it\u2019s delving into piracy with Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. I recently got to spend two hours with the game, due out next month, and, I came away expecting Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio to once again nail new ideas while maintaining the series\u2019 old familiar draws. Pirate Yakuza puts the focus entirely on fan-favorite comic relief rival Goro Majima for the first time in the series\u2019 20-year history. Majima has been a supporting character and playable hero a few times over the years, but Pirate Yakuza is the first time he\u2019s been the lone star of the show. He\u2019s a good lead for a game that takes the series in one of its more outlandish directions yet, as he\u2019s often facilitated comic breaks with fervor and gusto. If there\u2019s one character that commits to the bit, it\u2019s him, and that includes becoming a pirate captain in modern-day Hawaii. Pirate Yakuza\u2019s story takes place six months after the events of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, and somehow Majima\u2019s lost all memory of his life as a crime boss and club manager. Pirate Yakuza doesn\u2019t use this as a complete break from previous games, as recovering his old memories is a core part of his story, but it does mean that he\u2019s taking on a new crew on the open seas off Hawaii\u2019s shores. Majima is at the center of a conflict between the pirates he works alongside and the yakuza he was once a part of. The tension between those two forces means Pirate Yakuza is constantly shifting between traditional Yakuza scraps and silliness and, as the name suggests, pirate ship battles. As far as hand-to-hand combat goes, Pirate Yakuza delivers some of the fastest-paced fighting the series has had, to the point that it feels like it borders on a character action game along the lines of Devil May Cry. Like a Dragon Gaiden experimented with spy gadgetry to give its combat a distinct feel, and Pirate Yakuza is riffing on its own motif by giving Majima a pair of cutlasses. The game feels snappy, stylish, and occasionally pretty tough. Swapping Majima between his harder-hitting pirate persona and the nimble yakuza one can make the difference between getting clobbered and overcoming a gang of criminals. I gravitated toward the knife-wielding yakuza style for one-on-one fights and swapped to the pirate one for wider slashes when taking on big groups. I was surprised by the difficulty of a few fights, such as one against a runaway prisoner I met on the beaches of Hawaii who cold-cocked me as I was still learning all the tricks I had at my disposal. Most of my memories of Yakuza 0\u2019s beat-em-up combat are of it being tedious and repetitive, so coming into Pirate Yakuza and finding something that felt involved and dynamic was a welcome sign. Story Continues Pirate Yakuza\u2019s riffs on old Yakuza ideas are where it shines the most. Even though Majima is sailing the seven seas this time, I still found the grounded moments traveling around cities on land to be just as memorable as duking it out on a pirate ship. Between silly mini-games and squaring up against any crook who would approach me, I rode around on a scooter until I stopped at a small cafe where employees were trying to attract customers with a small performance. Even as the series constantly pushes against the boundaries of what people think it is, those small human interactions remain the beating heart of Yakuza. The actual pirate ship battles are the part I\u2019m not quite sold on just yet, but I could see them getting more complex beyond the early sections of the game I played. Sailing to different islands on a slow-moving ship with weather hazards felt novel, but I could imagine it getting tedious down the line. Ship battles, meanwhile, feel complex in the menus beforehand, but in practice got rather monotonous as I would position my ship to fire upon incoming vessels, let out some cannonballs, then turn around and do the same thing from the other side. The depth comes from the preparation, which includes assigning crewmates with different specialties to weapon-manning and other tasks to bolster your ship\u2019s effectiveness in battle. Building your ship\u2019s arsenal and managing your crew were the most interesting part of ship battles in my time with the early game, and I\u2019m curious to see just how expansive these options are and if the game can spice these fights up as it goes on. Every time I pick up a Yakuza game, I\u2019m always surprised to see just how much RGG can bend what I think these games are without quite breaking them. The series has been characterized as grounded despite constantly escalating to new heights, and what I\u2019ve played of Pirate Yakuza feels like a natural yet goofy extension built off a stable foundation. We\u2019ll see if Majima\u2019s seafaring detour pays off when the game launches on February 21, but even if it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m more curious than ever about how far RGG is willing to take its heroes as it keeps pushing the boundaries of what it means to be a Yakuza game.

Premarket On Tuesday? Lekha Gupta Tue, Jan 7, 2025, 4:32 PM 2 min read In This Article: GORO +3.15% Why Is Gold Resource Stock Falling Premarket On Tuesday? Gold Resource Corporation (AMEX: GORO ) shares declined premarket on Tuesday after the company disclosed a registered direct offering of up to 15.63 million shares at $0.16 per share . The company aims to raise approximately $2.5 million. The offering is expected to close within 10 days, pending customary conditions. Last month, Gold Resource provided an update on its operations and liquidity, noting improved production at the Don David Gold Mine in November compared to earlier in the fourth quarter . Higher metal prices and a favorable USD/MXN exchange rate helped the mine achieve slightly positive cash flow for the month. While cash balance concerns remain, the company expects DDGM operations to continue through at least the first quarter of 2025 without immediate capital injections. Gold Resource said last month that additional funding is required for equipment, mill upgrades, and working capital to advance the Three Sisters and Splay 31 areas, which are key to future production at DDGM. Without new capital, the mine is unlikely to sustain break-even cash flow beyond the first quarter of 2025, and any unforeseen production issues could further threaten near-term operations. Additionally, DDGM overpaid approximately $3.8 million in Mexican taxes in 2023 and has filed for a refund, expected in 2025, though the timing remains uncertain. As of September 30, 2024, the company had a cash balance of $1.4 million . Price Action : GORO shares are down 8.22% at $0.21 premarket at the last check Tuesday.

GlobalData Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 3:22 PM 2 min read Nickel miner Prony Resources New Caledonia will recommence operations at its Goro mine and battery-grade nickel production plant, located in the south of New Caledonia, after a six-month suspension caused by local riots in the French territory, reported Bloomberg . The return of the workforce marks a significant step for Prony Resources, one of the three major nickel producers in New Caledonia. Goro mine is designed to produce 57,000tpa of nickel and 5,000tpa of cobalt. Laterite nickel is extracted from an open-pit site, which is processed in a feed preparation plant and treated in a high-pressure acid leach facility. The industry faced near-collapse last year due to plummeting nickel prices, exacerbated by increased production in Indonesia. In August 2023, a government report warned that the sector requires refinancing and restructuring to support EU critical raw materials independence. The report analysed the long-term negative performance of three of France\u2019s most significant metals corporations operating in New Caledonia, including Prony Resources. Compounding the economic challenges, New Caledonia experienced civil unrest this year, leading to substantial damage to mining operations and disrupted processing plant activities. Amidst these difficulties, the French Government is working to stabilise the industry through subsidies and investments in renewable energy. In February, the government provided $150m (\u20ac142.12m) to avert the collapse of Prony Resources and to continue its operations until 2026. Prony Resources is targeting a monthly production goal of 3,500t of nickel and cobalt chemicals, which are key components for electric vehicle batteries. However, the company's spokesperson noted that while preparations are under way, a specific date for production restart has not been confirmed. Sibanye-Stillwater, a South African precious metals producer, is exploring Prony Resources as a potential supplier of nickel for its battery-grade material production at the Sandouville plant in France. \"Prony Resources gears up for nickel production restart at Goro mine\" was originally created and published by Mining Technology , a GlobalData owned brand.

Business Wire Tue, Dec 3, 2024, 1:56 AM 4 min read In This Article: GORO +3.15% DENVER, December 02, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Gold Resource Corporation (NYSE American: GORO) (the \"Company\") announces an update to the operational and liquidity matters that were reported at the end of the third quarter. During the month of November, the Company has seen an improvement in production at the Don David Gold Mine (\"DDGM\") as compared to earlier in the fourth quarter. Strategic mine planning succeeded in providing sufficient mining faces, and issues with the filter press and mill have been addressed for the time being. The improved production during the month, combined with high metal prices and the favorable US dollar to peso exchange rate, allowed the mine to operate at slightly better than break-even cash flow during the month. While the Company\u2019s available cash balance remains a concern, based on recent performance at the mine, the Company currently expects that operations at DDGM could continue through at least the first quarter of 2025 without immediate capital infusions. The Company still requires additional funding for mining equipment, mill upgrades and working capital to develop the Three Sisters and Splay 31 areas that will be the basis for future production at DDGM. Without additional capital, the Company currently expects that DDGM will not be able to operate near break-even cash flow beyond the first quarter of 2025. If any significant unforeseen production or processing challenges were to materialize at DDGM, the Company\u2019s ability to continue to operate DDGM in the near-term would be further jeopardized. Various financing and funding options are currently being evaluated by the Company. The Company has also identified an overpayment by DDGM of Mexico taxes in 2023 and has submitted a tax refund request for approximately $3.8 million ($76 million pesos). This amount is expected to be refunded to the Company in 2025, although the exact timing of payment is unpredictable. About GRC: Gold Resource Corporation is a gold and silver producer, developer, and explorer with its operations centered on the Don David Gold Mine in Oaxaca, Mexico. Under the direction of an experienced board and senior leadership team, the Company\u2019s focus is to unlock the significant upside potential of its existing infrastructure and large land position surrounding the mine in Oaxaca, Mexico and to develop the Back Forty Project in Michigan, USA.
