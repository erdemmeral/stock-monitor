[{"text": "UL Solutions and Eyesafe Collaborate to Advance Blue Light Protection PR Newswire Tue, Jan 28, 2025, 2:07 PM 4 min read Guided by the latest health research and insights from doctors, Eyesafe is introducing new industry requirements for displays and screen protection accessories. UL Solutions will verify product efficacy to the requirements on blue light emissions and circadian impact. MINNEAPOLIS , Jan. 28, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Eyesafe , a global provider of blue light solutions and technology, announced at CES 2025 the launch of Eyesafe \u00ae Display Requirements 3.0 and Eyesafe \u00ae Accessory Requirements 3.0. These new programs set criteria for the consumer electronics and screen protection industries, establishing thresholds for high-energy blue light and color performance. UL Solutions and Eyesafe announce science-backed blue light marketing claim verification methodologies for displays and screen protection. Eyesafe and UL Solutions have developed new industry methodologies to help verify marketing claims related to blue light reduction and color performance. Eyesafe \u00ae Display Requirements 3.0 Defines key criteria, including blue light toxicity, circadian stimulus, color gamut and color temperature, to measure a product's blue light emissions associated with visual comfort and sleep disruption, while ensuring display color performance. RPF \u00ae (Radiance Protection Factor): Measures protection from blue light that can impact eyes, focusing on the blue light hazard, peaking between 435-440 nanometers (nm). 1 The higher the score (on a scale of 0-100), the better the blue light reduction. A score of 35 or higher is needed to earn a marketing claim verification. CPF (Circadian Protection Factor): Focuses on reducing blue light that can affect sleep and circadian rhythms (480-500 nm). 2 Higher scores indicate less circadian disruption, with 35 or higher needed to earn a marketing claim verification. Color Performance : Determines accuracy and vividness of display colors. Download the Eyesafe \u00ae Display Requirements 3.0 White Paper Eyesafe \u00ae Accessory Requirements 3.0 Defines key criteria tailored to display type (LCD/LED or OLED) to measure a product's blue light emissions associated with visual comfort and/or circadian impact, while ensuring display color performance. For LCD/LED Screens (common in laptops and monitors): The assessment methodology focuses on RPF, or level of blue light filtration across the wavelengths that may impact eye health (435-440 nm) 1 and blue light toxicity reduction. The higher the score (on a scale of 0-100), the better the blue light reduction. A score of 20 or higher is needed to earn a marketing claim verification. For OLED Screens (common in smartphones): The assessment methodology targets CPF, or level of blue light filtration across the wavelengths that can affect melatonin production and circadian rhythms (peak 480-500 nm) 2 and change in circadian impact (380-780 nm). Higher scores indicate less circadian disruption, with 20 or higher needed to earn a marketing claim verification. Color Accuracy: All products must meet criteria for correlated color temperature and luminance to ensure display colors remain vibrant (accommodations provided for privacy screen protection). Story Continues Eyesafe Display Requirements 3.0 and Eyesafe Accessory Requirements 3.0 provide important guidelines to assess that digital devices and accessories not only provide effective blue light protection but also deliver a great visual experience. Products are tested and verified by UL Solutions, upon which manufacturers receive the UL Marketing Claim Verification Mark, helping consumers identify products that deliver on performance claims.

24, 2025, 1:25 AM 3 min read In This Article: COLB -2.01% CPF -2.11% Columbia Banking (COLB) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.71 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.65 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.44 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 9.23%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times. Columbia Banking , which belongs to the Zacks Banks - West industry, posted revenues of $487.12 million for the quarter ended December 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.91%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $519.16 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Columbia Banking shares have added about 6.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 3.5%. What's Next for Columbia Banking? While Columbia Banking has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Columbia Banking: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

PRODUCTION AND SALES METRICS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024 PR Newswire Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 9:40 AM 2 min read In This Article: SASOF 0.00% SSL +1.70% JOHANNESBURG , Jan. 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Sasol has published its production and sales performance metrics for the six months ended 31 December 2024 on the Company\u00b4s website at www.sasol.com , under the Investor Centre section: https://www.sasol.com/investor-centre/financial-results . Sasol took a Final Investment Decision (FID) in December 2024 for a destoning solution to enhance the coal quality supplied to Secunda Operations (SO), with beneficial operation of the solution expected in H1 FY26 which is earlier than the previous communicated date. The civil unrest in Mozambique affected the Central Processing Facility (CPF), leading to reduced production rates in December 2024 . The situation at the CPF has improved and the unit is now operating at full capacity, albeit with heightened near-term risk still prevalent. On 4 January 2025 , a fire occurred at the Natref refinery that caused damage to supporting piping and infrastructure around the Crude Distillation Unit. Our team responded swiftly to contain the fire, with no reported injuries. Repairs are anticipated to be completed before the end of February 2025 and plans are being implemented, including product purchases to address supply shortfalls, where possible. At SO we have experienced operational challenges, largely related to ongoing coal quality complications and the consequent impact on gasifier and equipment availability. The implementation of destoning and ongoing equipment reliability improvement initiatives are expected to improve production levels going forward. International Chemicals revenue improved compared to H1 FY24, though the overall business environment remains challenging. Sales volumes in the quarter continued to be negatively impacted by the East Cracker outage in the US. However, the unit started up successfully in November 2024 . Overall profitability has improved due to proactive management initiatives. Market guidance for both Mining and Gas remains unchanged, with the annual volume outlook for SO and Natref revised downward due to the aforementioned challenges. Consequently, we expect sales volumes for Fuels and Chemicals Africa to be largely in line with FY24. Despite the operational challenges faced during the quarter, we remain committed to executing key self-help initiatives aimed at improving performance and mitigating the challenges we face. ORYX production volume guidance was revised upwards. Sales volume guidance for International Chemicals has been adjusted downward to 4 - 8% lower than FY24, driven by weaker-than-expected demand and unplanned operational outages. However, the financial impact has been mitigated through effective cost management initiatives, and improved margins compared to the prior period.

Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 1:17 AM 4 min read In This Article: TETHF +17.74% Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands--(Newsfile Corp. - January 22, 2025) - Tethys Petroleum Limited (TSXV: TPL) (\"Tethys\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to provide the following updates regarding its regulatory progress and operational milestones at the Kul Bas oil field. Regulatory Update On November 18, 2024, Tethys received all ecological and environmental approvals for 2024, followed by the 2025 ecological permit on December 9, 2024. These approvals allow the Company to produce up to 490 tons/day under the Preparatory Period of Contract No. 1897 for the Kul Bas field, which expires on July 26, 2026. As stipulated under the Subsoil Use Code, all hydrocarbons produced during the Preparatory Period must be sold domestically. On January 8, 2025, Kul-Bas LLP submitted an application to the Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Kazakhstan to transition Contract No. 1897 for the Kul Bas field to the Production Period. This extension is essential for securing the long-term development of the field, enabling the Company to continue production until July 2048 and granting the right to export hydrocarbons, thereby unlocking the field's full commercial potential. According to the Subsoil Use Code, the Ministry is required to issue a decision within 20 business days (by February 5, 2025). The Company remains hopeful for a timely resolution and continues to actively engage with the Ministry to expedite this critical process. Operations Update In addition to the limitations from the regulatory approval, oil production is also constrained by a limitation on the amount of associated gas from the oil production that can be flared. Tethys is working to convert gas to electricity in order to limit gas emissions. As part of this process, the commissioning of the Central Processing Facility (CPF) at Kul Bas was successfully completed on November 19, 2024. Additionally, the Gas Utilization Facilities (GUF) were commissioned on January 17, 2025. These developments help ensure compliance with environmental requirements and support increased levels of oil production at the field. The successful commissioning of the facilities on January 17 brings the end of the planned Phase 1 work to a conclusion. Phase 1 was to primarily handle the associated gas from the first 3 wells in production (KBD-2, KBD-6 and KBD-7). The current plan is to allow these oil handling and gas utilization facilities to operate for a brief period and then for management to prepare a proposal for a Phase 2 program. These new oil handling and gas utilization facilities would allow for increased levels of oil production and for bringing on wells KBD-3, KBD-4 and KBD-8 (if/when the production license allows). Story Continues Another limitation on the amount of oil that can be produced can be the logistics. The logistics is handled by the oil buyers as Tethys sells the oil at the field. The buyers ability to handle the logistics can be influenced by the amount of trucking, rail cars, transshipment capacity (moving oil from trucks to rail cars) in the market and by the weather/road conditions. At present, Kulbas is selling oil primarily to mini-refineries given the higher price offered (as compared to the state refineries). The Republic of Kazakhstan has renewed a prohibition that doesn't allow for companies to export naptha (one of the byproducts of the oil refining). The loss of this export market hurts the mini-refineries and ultimately further reduces the price paid for oil as compared to export prices. While the other factors are largely temporary in their impact on the logistics, the elimination of the ability to export naptha appears to be negatively impacting the prices Tethys is offered for oil on a sustained basis. The Company remains committed to its strategy of responsible growth and is focused on optimizing its operations while meeting all regulatory requirements. About Tethys Tethys is focused on oil and gas exploration and production activities in Central Asia and the Caspian Region. Disclaimer Some of the statements in this document are forward-looking.

consideration of US$150,000,000 (~C$215,000,000) Maurel & Prom is a globally recognized upstream energy company headquartered in Paris , supported by its controlling shareholder Pertamina, the state oil company of Indonesia , with almost two centuries of operating experience across Africa , Latin America and Europe The Transaction significantly de-risks the development of Sinu-9, one of Colombia's largest onshore natural gas fields, by securing a strong, well-capitalized operating partner with a proven track record in technical and operational excellence. This partnership accelerates the delivery of natural gas, a key resource in Colombia's energy transition strategy, while ensuring the country's energy needs are met reliably over the long term CALGARY, AB , Jan. 20, 2025 /CNW/ - NG Energy International Corp. (\" NGE \" or the \" Company \") (TSXV: GASX) (OTCQX: GASXF) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a letter of intent (the \" LOI \") with Etablissements Maurel & Prom S.A. (\" Maurel & Prom \" or \" M&P \"), pursuant to which NGE will sell a 40% operating working interest in the Sinu-9 Block (\" Sinu-9 \") to Maurel & Prom for total cash consideration of US$150 million (the \" Transaction \"), with an effective date of February 1, 2025 . NG Energy International Corp. Logo (CNW Group/NG Energy International Corp.) Sinu-9 covers an area of approximately 311,353 acres in the Department of Cordoba, Colombia , and is fully permitted with environmental approval granted by the National Authority of Environmental Licences to drill 22 wells from 11 locations. As of December 31, 2023 , Sinu-9 has 1,2 : Company gross 1P reserves of 26.7 Bcf (37.0 Bcf project gross) of natural gas; Company gross 2P reserves of 114.36 Bcf (158.8 Bcf project gross) of natural gas; Company gross 3P reserves of 245.3 Bcf (340.8 Bcf project gross) of natural gas; Company gross unrisked best estimate contingent resources (development pending) of 130.2 Bcf; and Company gross unrisked best estimate prospective resources of 131.0 Bcf.

Brian Paes-Braga , Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"Bringing on an operational partner such as Maurel & Prom at Sinu-9 is a game changer for NGE. It allows NGE to maintain a significant 32% stake in Sinu-9, while at the same time welcoming a distinguished operational partner with in-country expertise, which we expect will increase both speed and certainty in unlocking the full potential of this giant oil and gas field. This initiative demonstrates NGE's commitment to delivering long-term value creation for our shareholders through cost-effective acquisition, delineation and development of early-stage transition energy assets. The Transaction puts NGE in an excellent position to advance the development of Maria Conchita , while expediting the advancement of Sinu-9 into one of Colombia's largest natural gas fields. The Transaction allows us to maintain exposure and unlock value from what we view as world class assets in Colombia , while providing cash proceeds to support our continued evaluation of opportunities, both domestically and internationally, in addition to providing a meaningful return to our shareholders in the near term.\" Story Continues Maurel & Prom is a global, publicly listed oil and gas exploration and production company headquartered in Paris with almost two centuries of operational history, including over twenty years as an oil and gas operator. M&P currently holds exploration and production interests in Latin America and Africa and has a strong technical and operating track record in these jurisdictions. M&P is an arm's length party to the Company and is supported by its controlling shareholder Pertamina, an Indonesian state-owned oil and natural gas corporation.\u00a0Given M&P's current and outstanding cash position and undrawn portion of its credit facilities, NGE's Board of Directors and advisors have comfort in the financing of the Transaction. Brian Paes-Braga continued, \"Maurel & Prom is a world class company, founded in the 1800s and supported by Pertamina, the state oil company of Indonesia . It is with great honour and excitement that NGE will be partnering with such a well-managed and operated business, which has an extensive track record of developing energy assets across the globe, as well as deep experience in Colombia . We believe that this partnership will increase the pace of development of Sinu-9 as we welcome an international operational partner of this calibre to ensure that Colombians get the natural gas they need to continue to live and grow as a country.\" Closing of the Transaction is subject to negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement, the receipt of regulatory approvals, including the approval of the Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos, and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. BofA Securities, Inc. and Peters & Co. Limited are acting as lead financial advisors to NGE in connection with the Transaction. Wildeboer Dellelce LLP is acting as legal counsel to NGE in connection with the Transaction. _____________________________________ 1 It is important to note that Possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than Probable reserves. There is a 10% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of Proved + Probable + Possible reserves. All estimates of future net revenue, whether calculated without discount or using a discount rate, do not represent fair market value. 2 For information regarding the preparation of the Reserves and Resources information pertaining to Sinu-9 please see the section entitled \" Information Regarding the Preparation of Reserves and Resource Information \" in this press release. Production Guidance Update Maurel & Prom and NGE will be working collaboratively to determine the updated development plan for Sinu-9 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2025 , which will be announced in conjunction with closing of the Transaction; at that time, NGE will also be able to provide updated corporate guidance. Sinu-9 Testing and Commissioning Update Following the Company's press release dated November 4, 2024 , NGE has connected Brujo-1X and Magico-1X to Central Processing Facility 1 (\" CPF-1 \") at Sinu-9 and is encouraged by the production results from both wells, affirming better than expected productivity and strong reservoir performance. The results are summarized below: Brujo-1X DST-2: Averaged 7.9 MMcf/d over 15 days at an average choke of 28/64\u02ba; prior to closing the well, the Company tested a choke of 40/64\u02ba and reached production of 13.8 MMcf/d; Brujo-1X DST-4: Averaged 8.0 MMcf/d over 5 days at an average choke of 32/64\u02ba; and Magico-1X: Averaged 7.6 MMcf/d over 5 days at an average choke of 34/64\u02ba. During this initial production testing phase, it was determined that CPF-1 would require additional equipment to handle small amounts of condensates in order to ramp up production and realize the full potential of both Brujo-1X and Magico-1X. These field characteristics are not uncommon in Colombia , with examples like La Creciente that have analogous molecule specifications. The Company and its infrastructure partner have successfully acquired and assembled ~70% of the necessary equipment at site and anticipate completing the installation, commissioning and ramp-up of production starting in early February. Ramp up is expected to reach 10 MMcf/d during the month of February, with full production expected early Q2 as additional equipment arrives to site and wells are re-opened. Additionally, the Company executed a 'take-or-pay' arrangement on a mobile plant with its partner, INFRAES, that will provide additional processing capacity, inclusive of the required equipment to handle the condensates, of up to an additional 10 MMcf/d. The mobile plant will bring total gas processing capacity at Sinu-9 to 50 MMcf/d upon completion of the activities described above. Capital Allocation Strategy The Transaction, which allows NGE to capture immediately value on a portion of its working interest in Sinu-9, will enable NGE to provide shareholders with meaningful value.\u00a0NGE intends to implement an updated capital allocation strategy upon closing of the Transaction that will be a disciplined and balanced approach to invest in various growth opportunities, have the flexibility to potentially pursue the repurchase of its common shares, as well as potentially reward shareholders through dividends. NGE anticipates that further details surrounding NGE's capital allocation strategy will be disclosed upon closing of the Transaction. About NG Energy International Corp.

For additional information regarding the Sin\u00fa-9 Report, the Maria Conchita Report and the reserves information contained in this news release please see the 2023 51-101F1 filed on SEDAR+ on April 26, 2024 , and the Company's news release dated December 27, 2023 entitled \"NG Energy Announces 551% YOY Increase to 3P Reserves\". Caution Respecting Reserves Information The determination of oil and natural gas reserves involves the preparation of estimates that have an inherent degree of associated uncertainty. Categories of Proved, Probable and Possible reserves have been established to reflect the level of these uncertainties and to provide an indication of the probability of recovery. The estimation and classification of reserves requires the application of professional judgement combined with geological and engineering knowledge to assess whether or not specific reserves classification criteria have been satisfied. Knowledge of concepts including uncertainty and risk, probability and statistics, and deterministic and probabilistic estimation methods is required to properly use and apply reserves definitions. The recovery and reserve estimates of natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves provided herein are estimates only. Actual reserves may be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein. The estimated future net revenue from the production of the disclosed natural gas reserves does not represent the fair market value of these reserves. Information Regarding Reserves Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of commercially recoverable oil, natural gas and related substances anticipated to be recoverable from known accumulations, as of a given date, based on the analysis of drilling, geological, geophysical and engineering data; the use of established technology; and specified economic conditions, which are generally accepted as being reasonable. Reserves are further classified according to the level of certainty associated with the estimates and may be subclassified based on development and production status. \" Proved reserves \" are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated Proved reserves. \" Probable reserves \" are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than Proved reserves. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated Proved plus Probable reserves. \" Possible reserves \" are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than Probable reserves. It is unlikely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of the estimated Proved plus Probable plus Possible reserves. There is a 10% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of Proved plus Probable plus Possible reserves. The qualitative certainty levels referred to in the definitions above are applicable to \"individual reserves entities\" (which refers to the lowest level at which reserves calculations are performed) and to \"reported reserves\" (which refers to the highest-level sum of individual entity estimates for which reserves estimates are presented). Reported reserves should target the following levels of certainty under a specific set of economic conditions: at least a 90% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimated Proved reserves; and at least a 50% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of estimated Proved plus Probable reserves. A qualitative measure of the certainty levels pertaining to estimates prepared for the various reserves categories is desirable to provide a clearer understanding of the associated risks and uncertainties. However, the majority of reserves estimates will be prepared using deterministic methods that do not provide a mathematically derived quantitative measure of probability. In principle, there should be no difference between estimates prepared using probabilistic or deterministic methods. Each of the reserve categories (Proved and Probable) may be divided into developed and undeveloped categories as follows: \" Developed Producing reserves \" are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from completion intervals open at the time of the estimate. These reserves may be currently producing or, if shut-in, they must have previously been on production, and the date of resumption of production must be known with reasonable certainty. \" Developed Non-Producing reserves \" are those reserves that either have not been on production, or have previously been on production, but are shut-in, and the date of resumption of production is unknown. \" Undeveloped reserves \" are those reserves expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a significant expenditure (e.g., when compared to the cost of drilling a well) is required to render them capable of production. They must fully meet the requirements of the reserves classification (Proved, Probable and Possible) to which they are assigned and expected to be developed within a limited time. In multi-well pools it may be appropriate to allocate total pool reserves between the developed and undeveloped subclasses or to subdivide the developed reserves for the pool between developed producing and developed nonproducing. This allocation should be based on the estimator's assessment as to the reserves that will be recovered from specific wells, facilities and completion intervals in the pool and their respective development and production status. Estimates of reserves and future net revenue for individual properties may not reflect the same confidence level as estimates of reserves and future net revenue for all properties, due to the effects of aggregation. Additionally, all estimates of future net revenue, whether calculated without discount or using a discount rate, do not represent fair market value. SOURCE NG Energy International Corp.
