[{"text": "Enphase Energy Announces Technology Integration into Octopus Energy Smart Tariff Program in the United Kingdom Enphase Energy, Inc. Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 4:00 PM 5 min read In This Article: ENPH +2.62% Enphase Energy, Inc. FREMONT, Calif., Jan. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ: ENPH), a global energy technology company and the world's leading supplier of microinverter-based solar and battery systems, announced today that the Enphase \u00ae Energy System has integrated into Octopus Energy\u2019s smart tariffs, such as \u201cIntelligent Octopus Flux\u201d (IO Flux), which can save customers money on electricity bills. Last year, Enphase announced a new strategic relationship with Octopus to deploy IQ8\u2122 Microinverters and IQ \u00ae Battery 5P\u2122 in the U.K. Octopus Energy uses Kraken - its proprietary software platform - to manage, control, and optimize distributed energy resources (DERs), allowing customers to flexibly control Enphase\u2019s solar and battery systems. Many Octopus customers have already integrated this technology to unlock low-cost home energy rates. Now, Octopus customers with Enphase solar and battery systems can benefit from Intelligent Octopus Flux - a smart import and export tariff. The product optimizes the charging and discharging of solar and battery systems, aiming to provide customers the best rates for consuming and selling electricity. According to Octopus, more than 40% of IO Flux customers make a profit on their energy bills', getting paid for the energy they export rather than paying for energy import. Octopus customers with Enphase batteries can automatically charge when prices are lowest and export surplus energy during peak times, maximizing savings and supporting grid balance. \"Intelligent Octopus Flux helps customers make the most of their solar panels, optimizing usage in real time to cut bills,\u201d said Nick Chaset, executive vice president at Octopus Energy. \u201cTeaming up with Enphase, renowned for its reliable, top-notch tech, means we can deliver even more value to U.K. homeowners - saving money while building a smarter, greener grid together.\u201d Octopus Energy is the largest energy provider in the U.K., offering customer service and energy products to more than nine million households. The company has operations in 27 countries and its advanced data and machine learning platform, Kraken, supports more than 60 million customers worldwide. The third-generation Enphase Energy System with IQ Battery 5P and IQ8 Microinverters offers a significantly improved experience for homeowners and installers because of more power, resilient wired communication, and an improved commissioning experience. Homeowners can also use the Enphase \u00ae App to monitor performance and intelligently manage their systems. Enphase Energy Systems are fully G100-2 compliant to support the latest U.K. Electricity Networks Association requirements for grid connection of solar and battery storage. In addition, Enphase offers 24/7 customer support and an industry-leading warranty for both solar and battery products. This includes a 25-year warranty for all IQ8 Microinverters and a 15-year warranty for all IQ Batteries activated in the United Kingdom. Story Continues \"This partnership with Octopus Energy represents the next step in our mission to deliver more value to homeowners by combining advanced technology with innovative energy programs,\u201d said Marco Krapels, vice president of worldwide business development at Enphase Energy. \u201cWe're excited to work with Octopus on a global scale to provide meaningful wins for homeowners, Octopus, and all ratepayers, ultimately driving a cleaner, more cost-effective energy future.\" Enphase Energy is also a participant in the Octopus Energy GridBoost battery program in Texas.

(ENPH) Is One of the Best Ethical Companies to Invest in According to Reddit? Mashaid Ahmed Sat, Jan 25, 2025, 11:20 AM 6 min read In This Article: ENPH +2.62% RDDT +1.38% We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Ethical Companies To Invest In According to Reddit . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ: ENPH ) stands against other best ethical companies to invest in according to Reddit. In an era where corporate responsibility and sustainability are increasingly important, the concept of ethical companies has gained significant traction. Ethical companies are businesses that prioritize social, environmental, and governance (ESG) factors alongside financial performance. These companies aim to minimize their negative impact on the environment, promote social justice, and ensure good governance practices. They strive to reduce their carbon footprint, manage waste effectively, and promote sustainable practices. They also prioritize fair labor practices, support community development, and respect human rights. Ethical companies maintain high standards of transparency, accountability, and integrity in their operations and decision-making processes. Additionally, they engage with a wide range of stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, and the local community, to ensure that their actions are aligned with broader societal values. People invest in ethical companies for several compelling reasons. One of the primary motivations is risk mitigation. Ethical companies are less likely to face scandals or negative publicity, which can erode investor confidence and stock value. They are also better positioned to comply with existing and future regulations, reducing the risk of fines and legal issues. This can provide a more stable and predictable investment environment. Another reason is the potential for long-term value. Ethical companies often have more sustainable business models, which can lead to long-term growth and stability. They are frequently at the forefront of innovation, developing new products and services that meet the evolving needs of a conscious consumer base. Investors are also drawn to ethical companies because of their alignment with their personal values. Many investors are driven by a desire to make a positive impact on society. By investing in ethical companies, they can support businesses that share their values and contribute to social and environmental causes they care about. This alignment can provide a sense of satisfaction and purpose beyond financial returns.
