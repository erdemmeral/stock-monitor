Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 10:17 PM 13 min read In This Article: DEO -2.53% DVCMY -2.28% A multitude of factors are at play when it comes to fostering growth in non-alcoholic spirits - from price and availability, both on- and off-premise, to branding and the increasing consumer interest in health and wellness. Nevertheless, taste is a key consideration in order to drive growth in the category, and to convince consumers to come back for more after the initial trial. In a consumer survey conducted last year by Just Drinks' parent company GlobalData, taste and flavour were the key reasons for being discouraged to try \u201calternatives\u201d in alcoholic drinks, across all age groups, with the Boomer generation most likely to be \u201cput off\u201d, while Gen Z were least likely. Despite ongoing consumer hesitancy around taste in low- and zero-alcohol variants, some producers argue that non-alcoholic spirits now have access to the necessary technology and ingredients needed to develop winning flavour. \u201cThis sort of landscape of the supply chain - whether that's people making their own products or relying on third parties - all the technology exists now to be able to extract great flavour from great ingredients,\" says Ben Branson, co-founder of distilled non-alcoholic spirit brand Seedlip, now owned by Diageo. \u201cThat supply chain is very global, so I guess there's no excuse for not having great-tasting liquids.\u201d Branson presently heads up Pollen Projects, which claims to be \u201cthe world\u2019s first venture studio\u201d for the alcohol-free category. The venture has two \u201cprojects\u201d in the works \u2013 Seasn, a bitters range, and Sylva, a dark-aged spirit made through grain distillation and maturated with different types of wood, including padauk, red oak, and wood from Buffalo Trace whiskey casks. \u201cWhen you think [of] the reason why people keep drinking our drinks, it\u2019s because they taste nice\u201d, he says. \u201cWe're not drinking them for hydration. We're not drinking them, in the majority, for an effect or for a kind of functional reason. It sounds really obvious, but they've got to taste great because that's why people will choose them again.\u201d Non-alcoholic spirits are comprised of an array of brand extensions, category replicas, plus non-mimic brands that are looking to develop completely novel types of spirits with unique flavour profiles, but is there a secret to nailing the flavour profile in a young and developing category? Credit: GlobalData Mimicry is king As with non-alcoholic beer and wine, a question hanging over non-alcoholic spirits is whether they taste like \u2018the real thing\u2019. Smaller producers see this mimicry of spirits categories as a hurdle to progress. Story Continues \u201cI think there's a lot of imitation that goes on in our category, or a lot of attempted imitation that goes on to try and taste like something else,\u201d Branson says. \u201cI feel like I just keep banging the same drum, which is that we don't have to do that, and that's incredibly narrow actually when you think about just how few alcohol categories there are.\u201d Carl Brown, co-founder of UK-based Crossip, agrees, suggesting \u201cthere\u2019s a big onus on copying, and I think that is where the problem comes in\u201d. Instead of imitating a specific alcoholic spirit, Crossip\u2019s five SKUs focus on different flavour profiles \u2013 Blazing Pineapple, Dandy Smoke, Fresh Citrus and Pure Hibiscus. \u201cI'm not going to copy\u2026 a gin, vodka, rum or whatever, because then people are expecting that flavour, and they're expecting it to be exactly the same, and fundamentally, that's never going to happen,\u201d Brown says. When it comes down to non-alcoholic spirit launches, gin alternatives have led the segment so far, according to Kevin Baker, director of alcohol beverages at GlobaData. Mainly, he says, \u201cdue to the fact that the distillation of botanicals can be replicated without the creation of alcohol, making it easier to replicate the flavour of the core alcoholic variants\u201d. Imitation is evident in larger companies through brand extensions. Take Diageo\u2019s zero variations of Tanqueray and Gordon\u2019s gins, Captain Morgan Spiced Gold, Bacardi\u2019s two-SKUs extension for Martini, and Pernod Ricard\u2019s 0.0% version of its Beefeater gin launched in Spain last year. This isn\u2019t to say spirits giants haven\u2019t branched out beyond of extensions. Pernod Ricard has owned Ceder\u2019s non-alcoholic spirits range since 2021, while Diageo acquired Seedlip in 2019 and scooped up Ritual Zero Proof in September. Campari Group also has the non-alcoholic aperitivo Crodino and a two-strong alcohol-free bottled spirits range targeting the on-premise sector called Bitter Note and Ruby Tone. Crodino, sold across Europe and soon to roll out in North America, is marketed as a standalone brand. Andrea Neri, managing director, House of Aperitifs at Campari Group, explains that with Crodino, the business looks to produce a drink with \u201ca rich and complex tasting experience with its own distinctive personality, without mimicking historical alcoholic products\u201d. He adds: \u201cCrodino is not a reactionary \u2018non-alcoholic imitation\u2019: it is a strong, well-established, authentic, and loved product perfect for the aperitivo that transcends and precedes the recent non-alcoholic trend.\u201d The brand has been around since 1965 and acquired by Campari Group in 1995. Some big-player brands, however, do market drinks as being alternatives to specific spirits. Diageo\u2019s Ritual Zero Proof for example, frames its five-strong SKU range as \u201calternatives\u201d to Tequila, rum, whiskey, gin and aperitifs, promising in its USP to deliver that same \u201cflavour and aroma\u201d. Campari Group's non-alcoholic aperitivo, Crodino. Credit: Campari Group Technicalities Dealcoholisation techniques, such as membrane separation and vacuum distillation, are commonly used in non-alcoholic beer and non-alcoholic wine. However, players in the non-alcoholic spirits space seem to be embracing more novel technologies and unique ingredient combinations. For Crodino, Campari Group uses a secret mixture of herbs, spices, wood and root extracts, which are infused for six months. Diageo also keeps its cards close to its chest with its recipe for Tanqueray 0.0, but the process involves immersing botanicals in water, adding heat and then distilling. Siobhan Hamilton, general manager of innovation for Diageo\u2019s European and Africa markets, explains: \u201cThis special distillation process is a closely-guarded secret, known only to a handful of people, and we are incredibly proud to be bringing gin drinkers that juniper- and citrus-led taste they\u2019re expecting from Tanqueray when they choose not to drink alcohol.\u201d Crossip uses maceration to extract flavour. The process involves putting raw ingredients in a blend of water, glycerin, eucalyptus, ginger, cayenne and gentian, and then putting them under high pressure to extract flavours and produce a heavy liquid. The liquids are then blended to develop the final bottled product. Brown decided not to head down the dealcoholisation path, mainly due to price, but also because he did not see the value in attempting to replicate a particular spirit category. \u201cThere are ways to do it to a close-ish way,\u201d he says. \u201cIt depends if you're going to dealcoholise something - that makes a big difference. I personally didn't go down that route, and it's a lot more money\u2026 you can get very close to copying, but you won't be exactly the same.\u201d Some producers are also looking to completely new forms of technology to develop unique flavours. Branson\u2019s Sylva project uses ultrasound waves to age the liquid. After roasting a combination of wood types, the wood and rye distillate are put into kegs, placed in an ultrasound chamber, and then exposed to a frequency of 28,000 kilohertz per second. \u201cA tiny little explosion happens between the ultrasound waves and the wood, which ultimately explodes out the flavour and the character and the colour of the wood,\u201d Branson explains. When asked what types of technologies and processes we might see more of in the category down the line, Branson says processes like vacuum distillation allow producers to use \u201clighter, more delicate, more leafy\u201d ingredients, while spinning cone technology, already used regularly in non-alcohol beer and wine, were \u201cat scale and pretty well understood\u201d. Ultrasound on the other hand is less known in the industry, he says, \u201cbut it\u2019s a process that we really like and is effective as an extraction technique\u201d. An important factor to consider, Branson adds, is that most low-and-no spirit brands are \u201crelying on the flavour industry, and bottlers and co-packers\u201d, meaning the whole flavouring process isn\u2019t fully within their grasp. He adds: \u201cA lot of the extraction technology within our categories is not owned by the brands in our category, it\u2019s a very outsourced industry.\u201d For instance, the Pollen Projects team is in control of production for Sylva, but production of Seasn bitters is outsourced. \u201cI don't think there's a playbook to what is good and what isn't,\u201d says Imme Ermgassen, co-founder of alcohol-free aperitivo brand Botivo, adding: \u201cWe're going to have to see more and more of those kinds of innovative techniques to get to it, because just using flavours and water and current technologies isn't working hard enough to get to where we need to get.\u201d While Botivo is mostly focused on a small batch, single-SKU proposition, it has also experimented with borrowing from classic spirit aging techniques. Earlier this year, the brand partnered with London-based fine wine and spirits retailer Berry Bros & Rudd to launch a limited-edition version of its drink, which had been aged in Islay whisky barrels for three years, giving the typically bittersweet, citrusy, herbal beverage added smoky notes. Sylva aged dark non-alcoholic spirit. Credit: Pollen Projects What consumers want Despite the market featuring a mixture of standalone products, brand extensions and category alternatives, it seems that some consumers are still looking for replicas within the spirits category, but this depends on the market. For Crossip, consumers in the Middle East, its most important market , have been more receptive to its flavour-focused products as opposed to an alternative to a Tequila or whiskey. Brown explains: \u201cThere, people are much more open-minded on how they're going to use it, how they're going to develop it, and that's a really wonderful way to go.\u201d The Middle East may indeed be a key region for growth for Crossip, but in non-alc spirits\u2019 larger markets like Europe and the US, there still appears to be a demand for non-alcoholic copies of alcoholic spirits. \u201cWhen we think of the UK, the States\u2026.\u00a0 Europe or these markets, the much bigger challenge on spirits is people are just wanting that exact replica,\u201d Brown says. Though SMEs are looking to champion crafted and unique flavours in order to frame non-alc spirits as a new category that doesn\u2019t imitate a specific alcoholic spirit, it seems some consumers at least need some sort of baseline to compare these drinks to. As Pollen Projects' Branson puts it, developing flavour in non-alcoholic spirits is \u201ca bit of a balancing act of bringing some familiarity to the drinker, but also being able to make use of the freedom of being able to experiment with lots of different ingredients\u201d. Botivo bottle and liquid in glasses. Credit: Botivo The abv question While copying specific spirits categories might not be a popular choice for all non-alcoholic producers, trying to replicate that warm sensation we get at the back of our throats when drinking spirits is deemed essential to help the category stand out from other alcohol-free drinks like soft drinks or flavoured waters. As Botivo\u2019s Ermgassen says: \u201cThere's a few things which define and differentiate non-alcs from soft drinks, and that mouthfeel is a really, really important part of defining that category and ensuring that it feels separate.\u201d Delivering the experience alcohol gives drinkers without the key ingredient in question is easier said than done. \u201cConsumers crave the warmth, tingling and bitterness that alcohol delivers \u2013 but replacing these sensations is no easy feat,\u201d explains John Kelly, beverages strategy director at ingredients and flavourings house Kerry Group. \u201cThe challenge is finding technology that targets the right receptors in the tongue, triggering the same sensory experience, but without the alcohol.\u201d Kerry provides a range of solutions to help manufacturers give their non-alcoholic drinks the same \u201cgreat taste\u201d, he says. These include Spirit Absolutes, a technology that claims to offer \u201cthe same warmth and punch consumers love\u201d. Kerry\u2019s Tastesense Sensations ingredients portfolio is also said to be able to \u201c[trigger] the impact of heat, cooling and tingling sensations\u201d. So, is it possible to recreate those sensations alcohol typically gives spirits at 0.0% abv? Hamilton at Diageo says its Tanqueray \u201cnever comes into contact with alcohol\u201d and uses a \u201ccareful selection of flavours and ingredients\u201d which \u201crelease[s] across the temporal profile\u201d. Crossip also doesn\u2019t use any alcohol in production, while Botivo sits at 0.2% abv due to the alcohol from one of the drinks\u2019 key ingredients \u2013 apple cider vinegar, which Ermgassen says \u201chas a lot of the complexity to it that alcohol does\u201d. For Brown, going up to 0.5% benefits brands looking to replicate spirits categories, \u201cso if you are making a whiskey, it just gives you a little hint coming through, closer to that. But equally, I don\u2019t personally believe that making exact replicas is the way forward\u201d. Having that small abv amount does have its benefits, according to Branson at Pollen Projects. \u201cIt\u2019s really helpful to be able to have the option to use some ethanol in the process, because it is so effective, and that means we can make a better product at a better price in the right amount of time.\u201d Talking about Sylva, which has 0.5% abv, he adds that the team has been able to develop a warm sensation \u201cin the throat and in the chest and the back of the neck and into the eyes - I would call that a kind of alcohol impression that we've been able to deliver with our liquids\u201d. He could not confirm whether that tiny level of alcohol on its own is what gives the drink its warmth. That aspect of production stays confidential for now. Regardless of what\u2019s been achieved so far, when it comes to mouthfeel, Branson stresses there\u2019s still work to do: \u201cMouthfeel and body is, and will be, a continual opportunity to experiment and test for producers, for flavour houses and extract makers, and the alcohol companies as well.\u201d Crossip Fresh Citrus bottle and cocktail. Credit: Crossip All in good time When it comes to flavour, non-alcoholic spirits players are still figuring out how to deliver unique taste experiences without alcohol, and that won\u2019t happen overnight. \u201cWe basically believe that in order to get the richest, most complex flavours, you have to use real ingredients. You have to use processes that take time,\u201d says Botivo\u2019s Ermgassen. \u201cThere are no shortcuts. I think that for me, one of the challenges with a non-alcoholic experience is that I don't think enough time is always taken to really bring out and draw those flavours out.\u201d For now, there are consumers who remain enticed by spirit category \u2018copies\u2019 and 0.0% versions of big brands as they search for something familiar in a young category, but some producers are hopeful that the market will eventually see a shift to consumers accepting non-alcoholic spirits as an independent non-imitative category that puts unique flavours first. As Brown says, large brands dominate the market for now, but \u201cas people get more used to it, then you start looking for your vibe\u2026 I think when people get to that stage, the growth of flavour, the interest, the depth of what you're looking for, the knowledge of what you're looking for as well, will be so much more interesting\u2026it becomes more flavour based.\u201d \"To imitate or innovate: flavour development in non-alcoholic spirits\" was originally created and published by Just Drinks , a GlobalData owned brand.

Pricing and availability subject to change. What will we be drinking in 2025? Americans are chasing moderation. Mike Snider, USA TODAY Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 7:47 PM 10 min read The beer, spirits and wine industries were already prepared for a continued lull in sales for 2025, then came the U.S. surgeon general's call for cancer warning labels on alcoholic beverages. Add that buzz kill to a flight of other challenges facing the booze business: Dry January \u2013 and its sober-curious companion in fall, Sober October \u2013 along with the thriving year-round embrace of lower-alcohol and non-alcohol options , especially by younger consumers. Suddenly, moderation is sweeping the nation. Nearly half of Americans (49%) say they plan to drink less in 2025 \u2013 up from 41% who said that was their plan in 2024, according to a new survey, released Tuesday, commissioned by advertising and sales measurement technology firm NCSolutions . Leading the way: Generation Z , or adults ages 18 to 28, almost two-thirds of whom (65%) say they plan to drink less in 2025. Nearly four out of 10 in Gen Z (39%) said they will adopt a dry lifestyle in 2025. Back in 2023, about one-third of Americans (34%) surveyed said they planned to drink less. NCSolutions CEO Alan Miles thought the findings might be a reaction to the pandemic: \"People were maybe hitting the bottle a little too hard. Everyone was stressed out.\" Now, with a 3-year accelerating trend, \"it really feels more like a genuine cultural shift based, not on any morality of alcohol and drinking, but really on a sense that people want a healthy lifestyle,\" Miles told USA TODAY. Gen Z and millennials also are more likely to try alternatives to alcohol such as THC drinks , marijuana and edibles . \"It's not that people don't necessarily want escapism. It's just that they are not choosing alcohol to do it,\" Miles said. Non-alcoholic spirits, wine and beer section inside Pioneer Beverage in south Salem. Valentine's Day: Do you have relationship advice to live by? A cute first date story? Please share with us Total alcohol sales at stores down in 2024 This sober curious movement has affected change at the cash register. Total alcohol sales \u2013 beer, wine, spirits, seltzers, ready-to-drink cocktails \u2013 fell for the first time in three years, dipping less than 1% in 2024 to $112.9 billion from $113.6 billion in 2023, according to data firm NIQ 's tracking of sales in U.S. supermarkets, drug stores, mass-merchandise stores, convenience stores and liquor stores for the 52-week period ending Jan. 4, 2025. During the pandemic, \"people were drinking to cope with the shutdown, so we really had a robust time,\" said Rachel Lawson, an alcohol and hospitality law attorney at Dickinson Wright in Nashville. \"This is what I consider to be the natural valley to that peak.\" The percentage of Americans in 2024 who said they drink beer, liquor or wine in 2024 came in at 58%, according to Gallup . That's down from 67% in 2022 and a high of 71% in 1976-1978 period. The good news for the alcohol beverage industry: A recent USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll suggests few (18%) planned to drink less after Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy's advisory warning that consumption can increase cancer risk . Overall, 86% said they had no plans to drink less alcohol after the pronouncement. Still, the sober curious movement is having an effect. \"We've already seen this trend among consumers where they're opting for moderation, and that's why we're seeing the growth of non-alcohol products and a lot of suppliers are putting out lower alcohol products,\" said Kaleigh Theriault, associate director of beverage alcohol thought leadership at NIQ. \"So this trend of moderation, I think, is only going to continue.\" Non-alcoholic beer and low alcohol on the rise As sales of alcoholic beverages have plateaued, sales of non-alcoholic beer, drinks and spirits have intensified, up 27% in 2024. Consumers spent $829.2 million on non-alcoholic options in 2024, according to NIQ. NA beer accounts for most of the non-alcoholic spending, with sales up nearly 25% to $699.2 million. Among the newest entries, Bero, a line of non-alcoholic beers co-founded by actor Tom Holland. \"I fell in love with the non-alcoholic space. It really helped me get through the first year of sobriety,\" Holland says in a video on the Bero website . \"With Bero, I felt there was so much opportunity, not just to create a fantastic beer, but to also make a product that makes it simpler to live your best life.\" Holland's involvement \u2013 Men's Health magazine ran an interview earlier this month in which the actor mentioned Bero \u2013 could help the newcomer compete with top no-alcohol beers from Athletic, Budweiser and Heineken. Actor Tom Holland has co-founded Bero, a line of non-alcoholic beers. That's because Gen Z and millennials may follow the lead of celebrities and influencers. More than 1 in 4 (28%) of Gen Z and millennials in the NCSolutions survey said they had tried an alcohol-free drink endorsed by a celebrity or influencer. What are some popular non-alcoholic products? Well-known breweries have been embracing the NA beer game with Boston Beer, which brought its non-alcoholic Samuel Adams Just the Haze IPA to market in 2021, adding a Gold Rush lager two years later. Since launching its Trail Pass IPA and Trail Pass Golden NA beers in late 2023, Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. has added Trail Pass Hazy IPA and Brewveza. Most non-alcoholic beers contain about 0.5% alcohol, but there are a growing number of zero alcohol beers including top-seller Heineken 0.0 and Bud Zero . Due to hit stores soon: Michelob Ultra Zero. For hop heads, there's even hop-flavored water. One of the newest is Hop Water by Allagash, a carbonated drink made with hops and orange peel. Allagash Brewing Co., brought its Hop Water to market in June 2024.The carbonated non-alcoholic beverage is made with hops and sweet orange peel for a citrusy taste. There's a growing variety of non-alcoholic spirits , wine, champagne and mocktails to choose from, too. Non-alcohol options are increasing at bars, restaurants and other activities with 37% of those surveyed saying they've noticed more restaurants, bars and stores offering nonalcoholic options. \"I am stunned when I don't see one at a various bars and hotels,\" Lawson said. \"I literally tell them \u2026 you might want to consider getting one real quick.\" Beer: Modelo Especial still the king, but more imports could emerge Total beer sales dipped slightly in the U.S. in 2024, but consumers kept choosing Modelo Especial , which took the top spot from Bud Light in 2023. Sales of Modelo Especial rose about 7% to remain the top-selling beer in the U.S., based on spending, according to NIQ. (Bud Light is still the top seller in terms of volume.) Overall, beer sales at retail dipped slightly in 2024 at $56.8 billion, compared to $57.2 billion the year before, according to NIQ. There's room for Modelo Especial to grow \u2013 and for more competition, especially from other imports, said Dave Williams, vice president of analytics and insight for\u00a0Bump Williams\u00a0Consulting of Shelton, Connecticut, which services the alcoholic beverage\u00a0industry. Constellation Brands' portfolio includes Modelo and Corona as well as Pacifico, \"another rising star from Constellation,\" Williams said. \"I think we\u2019ll also see the quiet/tactical rise of Central American Imports as well\" including Famosa and To\u00f1a, lagers from Guatemala and Nicaragua, respectively. Modelo Especial remains the top-selling beer in the U.S., dollar-wise. Those beer sales figures include flavored malt beverages such as Twisted Tea, one of the beer sub-categories that helped keep overall category sales stable, Williams said. Other hot categories beyond imports were flavored beers and super premium beers such as Michelob Ultra, he said. Another trend in beer \u2013 a nod to the moderation movement \u2013 is lower alcohol beer. Dogfish Head is just now bringing to market a new 30 Minute Light IPA (alcohol content is 4%) to its lineup, which already included Slightly Mighty Low Calorie IPA (4% ABV and 95 calories). Dogfish Head's 30 Minute Light IPA is a 4% ABV beer with only 95 calories, and 3.6 grams of carbs. Spirits: Ready-to-drink cocktails Sales of spirits rose slightly in 2024, hitting $33.3 billion, up from $33.1 billion in 2023, according to NIQ. While spirits have also faced stalled growth, spirits-based ready-to-drink cocktails such as High Noon continued double-digit growth providing \"a boost to overall trends,\" Williams said. Prepared spirits-based cocktails sales increased more than 18%, accounting for $3.2 billion in sales in 2024, NIQ said. Their availability in convenience stores help fuel sales growth, Williams said. Ready-to-drink cocktails \u2013 including those flavored malt beverages that fall in the beer category \u2013 should continue to rise because they are also easy to serve and come in a multitude of flavors, making them a fit for younger consumers. \"This really is a preference for them,\" said Emily Xu, senior vice president for e-commerce and marketing at RNDC , the second largest alcohol distributor in the U.S. Growth could also come from some consumers \"trading down a little bit\" from higher-priced super-premium and premium spirits and opting for more affordable options, she said. Consumers could also benefit from spirits brands, faced with stagnant sales, pulling some less successful products from the market. \"I think a lot of brands will really be thinking about right-sizing their portfolio,\" she said. The Wall Street Journal is among outlets declaring there's a bourbon glut, a situation that could worsen if the Trump administration imposes tariffs on goods such as Canadian whisky and tequila and beer made in Mexico. That could lead to reciprocative tariffs on U.S.-made bourbon and whiskeys. The spirits category is making some news this month. A new Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau rule went into effect Jan. 19 establishing American Single Malt Whiskey as a new spirit category \u2013 the first new whiskey style in five decades. Among the requirements: it's made from 100% malted barley, just as single malt Scotch is made. American Single Malt Whiskey can be aged differently than bourbon whiskey \u2013 virgin American white oak casks are not required \u2013 so that \"really creates a whole different set of directions you can take the flavor profile of that whiskey,\" said Justin Aden, head blender at Stranahan\u2019s Colorado Whiskey , which has been making American single malt for 20 years. Stranahan\u2019s Colorado Whiskey lineup of American Single Malt whiskeys. The American Single Malt becomes a new spirit category in January 2025. The new rule should bring attention to the style. \"We're very, very proud to see this moment ... and we're excited for what it's going to bring on a wider curiosity and recognition level,\" Aden told USA TODAY. Wine sales continue downward trend Wine sales slipped 2.5% to $22.8 billion from $23.4 billion in 2023, according to NIQ. \"Wine is going to continue to face declines, but I think they are also the category that has the biggest opportunity, potentially, especially from an occasion standpoint,\" NIQ's Theriault said. As with distillers, wine makers are expanding their lower-alcohol and non-alcoholic beverages, she said. Wine in smaller 375 ml bottles, as opposed to traditional 750 ml bottles \u2013 and spirits in smaller bottles, too \u2013 are seeing \"moderate growth\" among some consumers, \"because that's a way also to moderate the cost,\" Xu said. Choosing the best wine glasses: Expert tips from a sommelier Still, within the alcoholic beverage industry, \"there's a correction going on, to be honest,\" Xu said. \"In general, the industry has been in decline in the last few years. I think you're going to see continued softness.\" While certain brands do well, others may not, she said. \"The beverage alcohol category itself is still a very big category, the consumption behavior or the customer is still there, which is just not evenly distributed,\" Xu said. Alcoholic beverages will \"continue to be that, that social connecting point, I think, in a lot of cases,\" Theriault said. \"Many consumers will opt for alternatives during certain occasions, but there's still going to be a group of consumers that opt for alcohol during many occasions.\" Follow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider .
