[{"text": "Zacks Small Cap Research 2024 Initiations and Best Ideas for 2025 Zacks Small Cap Research Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 12:00 PM 4 min read In This Article: MTVA LGNZZ TELO CLPMF GOTRF Zacks Small Cap Research was hard at work in 2024 initiating analyst coverage on 40 companies. Each of our initiation reports provides a valuation, investment thesis and financial forecast model that comes from our 11 experienced analysts\u2019 expertise and due diligence. Our work has generated investment ideas in health care, consumer electronics, finance technologies, transportation, AI-based products, and oil and gas production among other industries. The last year has been one fraught with risks, critical elections around the globe and multiple ongoing military conflicts among other material events. Despite this, index performance as measured by the S&P was positive in 2024, with large caps outperforming mid-caps and mid-caps surpassing small caps. Much of the strong performance was driven by tech stocks and the Magnificent Seven while other areas lagged. However, at Zacks SCR , we see a lot of opportunity in the smaller cap names. As we look forward to 2025, Zacks Chief Equity Strategist John Blank expects industrials and technology to continue their run and is recommending names in the transportation, insurance and utilities spaces. We list some of our best ideas in smaller end of the equity universe below: Ligand Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: LGND ) is a royalty aggregator which has a large opportunity set of biopharma names where it can deploy its capital for future growth. MetaVia Inc. (NASDAQ:MTVA; previously NRBO ) has two development assets in the metabolic space which could ride the tidal wave in the obesity driven by GLP-1 agonist success. Telomir Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: TELO ) represents another area of interest in longevity. It is developing a technology to address a variety of aging related disease. In the natural resources industry, Goliath Resources (OTC: GOTRF ) boasts an attractive land position and a large portfolio of future projects in gold and other metals extraction. Clip Money (OTC: CLPMF ), a fast-growing startup that provides inexpensive and convenient cash management services to small businesses. Transportation is another attractive area represented by Titan International (NYSE: TWI ). It is a global vehicle equipment manufacturer that targets the agriculture and construction markets manufacturing OEM-spec replacement products. Another transportation derivative is Consumer Portfolio Services (NASDAQ: CPSS ), which purchases and services auto loans. Its use of technology builds upon an improving backdrop of origination volumes. For those looking to take advantage of China\u2019s continued modernization and expanding middle class, Viomi Technology (NASDAQ: VIOT ) offers home water purification in a region increasingly demanding higher water safety. Story Continues Zacks SCR offers a number of compelling ideas that may be appropriate for your portfolio in 2025. From health care to manufacturing and consumer to technology, we have several small cap ideas that leverage the most important investment themes of the coming year.

Floor for the Stock, and Represent Key Catalyst for New Business Zacks Small Cap Research Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 12:28 PM 5 min read In This Article: BENFW By Michael Kim NASDAQ:BENF Landmark agreement: Following Beneficient (NASDAQ:BENF) de-SPAC in June 2023, the stock came under intense pressure \u2013 mostly a function of investor concerns around de-SPACs more broadly, and ongoing GWG selling (down from ~70% at the time of the closing to ~5% of total Class A common stock outstanding at present). Analysis and discussions on ways to counteract the stock\u2019s decline and provide downside protection for shares issued via ExchangeTrust transactions started in earnest in late 2023 and culminated in the announcement of the Public Stockholder Enhancement Transactions in late December 2024. At a high level, the transactions drive meaningful Tangible Book Value (TBV) accretion for public company stockholders, and serve as a key catalyst for reaccelerating and sustainable growth for BENF\u2019s core liquidity business, we believe. More specifically, the agreement provides public company stockholders with preferential treatment (previously reserved for Preferred Equity holders) in the event of a liquidation. Digging a bit deeper, BENF shareholders accrue 10% of the first $100 million distributed to equity holders upon liquidation, and 33.3% of the Net Asset Value of up to $5 billion of alternative assets added to BENF\u2019s balance sheet in connection with liquidity transactions completed after December 22, 2024. Separately, the transactions include a Customer Relations Initiative in which entities/affiliates controlled or owned by Chief Executive Officer Brad Heppner and current/former employees of the company agreed to waive rights to up to $400 million of equity exchangeable into BENF common stock. The foregone equity transfers into an incentive pool for existing and future customers in the form of securities exchangeable for common stock. Assuming a portion of clients decline participation in the Customer Relations Initiative (to be determined in the next few months), the residual rights will accrue to the benefit of public company stockholders. The closing of the Public Stockholder Enhancement Transactions is subject to approval, and is expected to be completed in 1H25. From our perspective, key takeaways from the pending transactions include: 1.\u00a0Key catalyst for new business: Beginning in the fourth quarter of last year when stockholder enhancement negotiations ramped up, senior executives put new business discussions with potential clients for normal course liquidity transactions on hold, thereby pausing ExchangeTrust transaction activity. Following the announcement of the Public Stockholder Enhancement Transactions, management is actively reengaging with prospective customers previously in the pipeline and relaunching sales/marketing efforts \u2013 likely resulting in reaccelerating origination volumes in short order. Indeed, Beneficient recently announced the closing of a $1.36 million primary capital commitment for a private equity fund managed by 8F Asset Management in exchange for Convertible Preferred Stock \u2013 reinforcing the efficacy of the company\u2019s public stockholder enhancement transactions. Story Continues Stepping back, global alternative assets under management totaled $16.3 trillion at the end of 2023 and are forecast to reach $24.5 trillion over the next five years fueled by rising allocations and strong investment returns. Of the total, medium-to-high net worth (MHNW) individuals and small-to-midsized institutions (STMIs) in the U.S. hold a growing $2+ trillion of related assets. Taking it a step further, simple math suggests annual demand for liquidity of ~$50 billion based on estimated turnover rates of 2% to 3%. Assuming mid-teen percentage CAGRs, Beneficient\u2019s Total Addressable Market (TAM) related to early liquidity likely more than doubles to $100+ billion over the next five years. On top of that, the company\u2019s GP Solutions and Primary Commitment Program businesses target private funds with identifiable liquidity and fundraising needs. In aggregate, related funds represent north of $400 billion of potential new business. As such, even a fractional win rate likely translates into meaningful transaction volumes and TBV/earnings accretion for BENF. 2.\u00a0Shoring up Tangible Book Value: Pro forma the transactions, BENF\u2019s TBV attributable to public company stockholders rises from breakeven to ~$9.8 million as of September 30, 2024. Moreover, pro forma TBV inches up to $10.2 million, or $1.22 per share, following the closing of the $1.36 million primary capital commitment, with the onboarding of assets immediately accretive to book value. Going forward, ~33% of the Net Asset Value of incremental liquidity closings involving the issuance of equity (i.e., ExchangeTrust transactions up to $5 billion) will accrue to BENF\u2019s tangible book value. Put another way, the next $20 million of deals \u2013 seemingly reasonable in the context of the $1 billion of liquidity transactions completed in the company\u2019s first two years of operations \u2013 will drive $6.6 million of TBV accretion, or more than BENF\u2019s current market cap. 3.\u00a0Valuation floor: At current levels, BENF is trading at a 47% discount to tangible book value \u2013 seemingly unsustainable in our view, particularly in light of recent moves to restructure the capital stack. Moreover, at 0.53x TBV, BENF continues to trade well below comparable stocks. At the low end of the peer group, select stocks currently trade at ~4x TBV. Applying a similar multiple to BENF\u2019s pro forma tangible book value translates into a fair value for the stock of around $5.00 \u2013 consistent with our earnings-based price target. Our primary valuation construct revolves around the Board\u2019s adopted ExchangeTrust Product Plan to complete up to $5 billion of loans backed by alterative assets. More specifically, our model incorporates seemingly conversative assumptions around interest rates, credit losses, fees, and margins, calculates pro forma EPS based on incremental share issuance to fund $1 billion of liquidity transactions, and applies a peer group average P/E multiple to our estimates. In our minds, the stock\u2019s ongoing underperformance provides investors with an attractive entry point for BENF as awareness and appreciation of the company\u2019s business model, more shareholder-friendly capital structure providing downside protection, reaccelerating growth prospects, and unique positioning increasingly take hold.

Transaction Beneficient Mon, Jan 6, 2025, 3:00 PM 9 min read In This Article: BENF BENFW Beneficient DALLAS, Jan. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Beneficient (NASDAQ: BENF) (\u201cBen\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a technology-enabled platform providing exit opportunities and primary capital solutions and related trust and custody services to holders of alternative assets through its proprietary online platform AltAccess, today announced it has closed on the financing of a $1.36 million primary capital commitment for 8F Fund, LP (\u201cFund\u201d), a fund managed by 8F Asset Management, a global asset manager that manages private equity funds that invest in vertically integrated aquaculture production and processing facilities. The transaction represents Ben\u2019s first GP Primary transaction since its recently announced Public Stockholder Enhancement Transactions. In exchange for an interest in the Fund, the Fund received approximately $1.36 million in stated value of shares of the Company\u2019s Resettable Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cPreferred Stock\u201d), which is convertible at the election of the holder into shares of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock, subject to the terms and conditions of the transaction documents. As a result of the transaction, the collateral for Company\u2019s ExAlt loan portfolio is expected to increase by approximately $1.36 million of interests in alternative assets. \u201cClosing this transaction underscores our commitment to executing on our core liquidity and primary capital business plan by delivering innovative capital solutions for holders and managers of alternative assets,\u201d said, Beneficient management. \u201cWe believe this financing reflects our ability to drive shareholder value while supporting impactful, vertically integrated investment strategies that enhance the value of the collateral backing our ExAlt loan portfolio. We look forward to building on this momentum in 2025 as we continue to evaluate additional opportunities that align with our strategic objectives.\u201d Upon closing of the previously announced Public Stockholder Enhancement Transactions, the Company believes this transaction will result in the addition of approximately $450K (and an aggregate of approximately $10.23 million) of tangible book value attributable to the Company\u2019s stockholders. Beneficient\u2019s GP Primary Commitment Program is focused on providing primary capital solutions and financing anchor commitments to general partners during their fundraising efforts while immediately deploying capital into our equity. Through the program, Beneficient seeks to help satisfy the up to $330 billion of potential demand for primary commitments to meet fundraising needs.

Book Value and Other Benefits to Beneficient Public Company Stockholders Provided by Entities Controlled by CEO & Founder, Brad Heppner, and Other Founders Beneficient Mon, Dec 23, 2024, 5:00 PM 16 min read In This Article: BENF BENFW Beneficient DALLAS, Dec. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Beneficient (NASDAQ: BENF) (\u201cBen\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a technology-enabled platform providing exit opportunities and primary capital solutions and related trust and custody services to holders of alternative assets through its proprietary online platform AltAccess, announced it has entered into an agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) with entities controlled by its founder and CEO, Brad Heppner, designed to enhance current and future shareholder value and drive long term growth. Pursuant to the Agreement, the holders of the preferred equity (the \u201cPreferred Equity\u201d) of Beneficient Company Holdings, L.P. (\u201cBeneficient Holdings\u201d), a subsidiary of the Company, agreed, among other things, to amend the governing documents of Beneficient Holdings to allow the Company\u2019s public company stockholders to share in the liquidation priority historically and currently reserved only for the Preferred Equity creating tangible book value attributable to the Company\u2019s public company stockholders following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement (the \u201cPublic Stockholder Enhancement Transactions\u201d or the \u201cTransactions\u201d). \u201cWe believe the Transactions would provide substantial value for our stockholders and enhance long-term growth opportunities,\u201d Heppner said. \u201cWe believe that providing for public company stockholders\u2019 participation in liquidation priority to create tangible book value historically reserved for preferred equity holders, will be a catalyst for closing liquidity transactions, and demonstrate our commitment to delivering shareholder value. This is an important milestone and we look forward to executing this vision and unlocking the full potential of our platform.\u201d As part of the Public Stockholder Enhancement Transactions, following closing, Ben\u2019s public company stockholders, through the Company\u2019s indirect interest in Beneficient Holdings, would receive preferential treatment in the event of a liquidation of Beneficient Holdings in an amount equal to (i) 10% of the first $100 million distributed to equity holders of Beneficient Holdings; and (ii) 33.3333% of the net asset value of up to $5 billion of alternative assets added to the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet on or after December 22, 2024, in connection with the Company\u2019s ordinary course liquidity business (the \u201cCapitalization Adjustments\u201d). Giving pro forma effect to the Capitalization Adjustments, the Company expects the tangible book value attributable to the public company stockholders of Ben as of September 30, 2024, to increase to approximately $10 million from $0, and Ben\u2019s market capitalization of its Class A and Class B common stock based on the closing price of the Class A common stock at market close on December 20, 2024 was $5,077,555. Story Continues The Company believes these changes will further align the interests of the holders of Preferred Equity with Ben\u2019s public company stockholders. This increased alignment is particularly apparent in connection with liquidity transactions where the Company issues equity to customers participating in ExchangeTrust transactions. Each such transaction would be expected to generate an additional immediate benefit in the form of increased tangible book value attributable to Ben\u2019s public company stockholders. While the Company continues to believe its true value is best assessed through its ability to grow over time by executing on its business plan, based on discussions with current and potential customers, advisors, and other market participants, the Company believes the Capitalization Adjustments will help bolster the value of its common stock and facilitate closing future transactions. The Company expects to begin closing additional ExchangeTrust transactions as soon as the first calendar quarter of 2025. Additionally, in a customer service initiative and as a part of the Public Stockholder Enhancement Transactions, upon closing, entities controlled by the Company\u2019s founder and CEO and an affiliate of the Company owned by certain current and former directors, officers, and employees of the Company would forego the right to receive up to $400 million of equity in Beneficient Holdings that is exchangeable into common stock of the Company for the benefit of certain of the Company\u2019s existing customers that elect to receive such rights (the \u201cCustomer Relations Initiative\u201d). To the extent any customers elect not to participate in the Customer Relations Initiative, their pro rata portion of such rights would instead be delivered to the Company for additional benefit of Ben\u2019s public company stockholders. Transaction Details In exchange for entering into the agreements to effect the Public Stockholder Enhancement Transactions, in addition to the matters described above, the Company has agreed that, among other things: (1) On the closing date of the Transactions and on the closing date of each ExchangeTrust Transaction, the Company would issue additional shares of Class B common stock pro rata to the current holders of Class B common stock (which include an entity controlled by the Company\u2019s CEO and other directors and officers of the Company) in an amount such that, immediately following the issuance, the holders of Class B common stock would then collectively hold 42.67% of the total combined voting power of the Company, an amount determined to maintain the voting power of the Class B common stock as of February 6, 2024, the date that the Company commenced negotiations on the Public Stockholder Enhancement Transactions. Such shares of Class B common stock would carry full voting rights provided that such shares would be subject to mandatory redemption by the Company at $0.001 per share upon any liquidation of the Company, immediately prior to any transfer of beneficial ownership of such shares of Class B common stock by the holder thereof (other than to permitted estate planning transferees who agree to the same restrictions), immediately prior to any conversion of such shares of Class B common stock, immediately prior to the sale, merger, or other liquidity event involving the Company or substantially all of its business. Further, the current holders of the Class B common stock shall each irrevocably waive and disclaim of the right to receive dividends, distributions, or other economic benefits of any kind with respect to such newly issued shares of Class B common stock, whether such dividends or distributions are paid in cash, property, or stock. In addition, such shares of the Class B common stock are subject to redemption by the Company at $0.001 per share upon certain events. (2)\u00a0 In addition to the amendments to the Beneficient Holdings\u2019 limited partnership agreement discussed above, the existing limitations on the conversion of the Preferred Series A Subclass 1 Unit Accounts held by Beneficient Holdings, Inc. (\u201cBHI\u201d), an entity affiliated with the Company\u2019s CEO, would be modified through December 31, 2027 such that (i) on the date that is 60 days following the closing, BHI would have the right to convert a portion of its Preferred Series A Subclass 1 Unit Accounts in an amount up to $10 million, and (ii) after the closing net asset value of the ExchangeTrust Transactions exceeds $100 million, BHI would have the ability to convert additional Preferred Series A Subclass 1 Unit Accounts subject to certain limitations and the Company\u2019s right to pay cash in the amount of the Preferred Series A Subclass 1 Unit Accounts to be converted in lieu of such conversion. (3) Upon closing of the Public Stockholder Enhancement Transactions, the Company\u2019s existing compensation policy will be amended to provide for clarifications relating to the administration of allocations and issuances of Class S Ordinary Units of Beneficient Holdings upon carrying value adjustments to holders of Beneficient Holdings\u2019 Subclass 1 FLP 1 Unit Accounts (\u201cFLP-1 Account\u201d), which is a capital interest held by BHI, and Subclass 2 FLP 2 Unit Accounts (\u201cFLP-2 Account\u201d), which is a profits interest held by an entity for the benefit of the directors, officers and employees of the Company and its affiliates. As a result, all carrying value adjustments resulting from the previous business combination and certain other transactions through the closing will result in the issuance of Class S Ordinary Units of Beneficient Holdings to the holders of FLP-1 Account and FLP-2 Account. Going forward, the limitations of the compensation policy will (i) continue to apply to allocations to the FLP-2 Account, and (ii) not apply to allocations to the FLP-1 Account, although certain Class S Ordinary Units issued with respect to the FLP-1 Account will be restricted in their conversion rights. (4) In addition, upon closing, the holders of the Preferred Series A Subclass 0 Unit Accounts shall agree to defer payment of the Guaranteed Series A-0 Payments provided for in the Beneficient Holdings\u2019 limited partnership through November 15, 2025; provided that any such Guaranteed Series A-0 Payment may be made prior to November 15, 2025 if the Audit Committee of the Company determines it would not be materially adverse to the Company\u2019s \u201cgoing concern\u201d financial statement assessment. The closing of the Public Stockholder Enhancement Transactions is subject to the approval of the stockholders of the Company, the limited partners of Beneficient Holdings and certain regulatory filings and, subject to satisfaction of such conditions, is expected to be completed in the first half of 2025. The foregoing description of the Public Stockholder Enhancement Transactions and the related agreements is a summary of certain pertinent terms and provisions and additional information is set forth in, and copies of the proposed agreements are attached to, the Company\u2019s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as of the date of this press release. The foregoing description is qualified by the additional information set forth in such Current Report on Form 8-K. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We present certain measures in this press release that are not measures of financial performance recognized by U.S. GAAP, including \u201ctangible book value\u201d and \u201ctangible book value attributable to Ben\u2019s public company stockholders .\u201d A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure that departs from U.S. GAAP because it includes or excludes amounts that are required under U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with U.S. GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as used by Ben may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. \u201cTangible book value\u201d is defined as the Company\u2019s total stockholders\u2019 equity reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets, plus temporary equity. \u201cTangible book value attributable to Ben\u2019s public company stockholders\u201d is defined as tangible book value, as defined above, less tangible book value attributable to Beneficient Holdings noncontrolling interest holders in a liquidating distribution of Beneficient Holdings.

Performance; Pivoting to Growth Zacks Small Cap Research Fri, Nov 15, 2024, 2:05 PM 6 min read In This Article: BENFW By Michael Kim NASDAQ:BENF READ THE FULL BENF RESEARCH REPORT After the market closed on 11/14/24, Beneficient (NASDAQ:BENF) reported F2Q25 (Sep) earnings results. On a GAAP basis, BENF reported net income of $0.03 per Class A diluted share for F2Q25 \u2013 the company\u2019s second consecutive profitable quarter as a public company \u2013 versus a loss of $115.95 per share for F2Q24. The year-over-year inflection primarily relates to more favorable revenue trends, and a $307 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge in F2Q24. On an adjusted business segment attributable to BENF equity holders basis, the company reported an operating loss of $2.3 million for F2Q25 compared to a loss of $4.6 million in F1Q25. The Q/Q improvement was largely a function of lower credit loss adjustments combined with lower operating expenses. The net loss equated to $0.52 per Class A share versus our $0.29 loss per share estimate. Relative to our model, the miss was primarily a function of fewer Class A shares outstanding combined with a $0.8 million loss on financial instruments and higher corporate expenses. After updating our model for F2Q25 actuals, we are refreshing our F2025 and F2026 EPS estimates. On an adjusted business segment attributable to BENF equity holders basis, we forecast a net loss per Class A share of $2.02 in F2025 (Mar) followed by net income per Class A share of $0.08 for F2026. Notably, our model builds in further increases in Class A shares outstanding reflecting ongoing ExchangeTrust transactions. Turning to valuation, despite our slightly lower earnings outlook, we are leaving our price target unchanged at $5.00, representing meaningful upside potential from the stock\u2019s current price. Our primary valuation construct revolves around the Board\u2019s recently adopted ExchangeTrust Product Plan to complete up to $5 billion of loans backed by alternative assets. More specifically, our model incorporates seemingly conservative assumptions around interest rates, credit losses, fees, and margins, calculates pro forma EPS based on incremental share issuance to fund $1 billion of liquidity transactions, and applies a peer group average P/E multiple to our estimates. In our minds, the stock\u2019s underperformance provides investors with an attractive entry point for BENF as awareness and appreciation of the company\u2019s business model, growth prospects, unique positioning, and valuation disconnect increasingly take hold. Following our review of F2Q25 results, we highlight the following key takeaways: 1. Reaccelerating growth: We expect origination volumes (and business activity more broadly) to start to reaccelerate reflecting a number of powerful industry and company-specific factors including: Story Continues a. Ongoing growth in alternative assets under management fueled by rising allocations and strong investment returns generates rising demand for liquidity, particularly as distribution activity remains muted more broadly reflecting lackluster exit markets and extended holding periods. Indeed, the median distribution rate across the industry for broadly diversified portfolios currently sits at around 8%, or well below the long-term average of 16%. More troubling, distribution rates remain essentially nil for below-median funds. While GPs can access the secondary markets for larger, more complex liquidity transactions, Beneficient focuses on underserved MHNW investors and STMIs that value certainty of price, cost, and time when seeking early liquidity options. From a regulatory perspective, it seems likely the incoming administration will promote a more friendly capital formation economy. In turn, we expect to see improving IPO markets driving reaccelerating distributions, and rising deal flow. That said, regulatory changes take time to flow through to the markets. As such, we forecast a near-term step up in demand for liquidity to fund expanding investment opportunities \u2013 seemingly boding well for BENF\u2019s LP early liquidity and GP fundraising solutions. b. Beneficient maintains a comprehensive go-to-market strategy spanning multiple clients, distribution channels, and approaches. Focusing on GP Solutions, the company targets funds facing identifiable liquidity needs including absolute/relative performance issues, limited carry potential, first-time managers, and those nearing winddown. In addition, Beneficient remains focused on developing enterprise-level solutions to advisory platforms via the company\u2019s Preferred Liquidity Provider (PLP) offering. The program leverages Beneficient\u2019s AltAccess platform to deliver turnkey liquidity, primary capital, custody, and reporting services to platform customers. Currently, the PLP business includes agreements with 20 alternative asset funds representing $1.5 billion of committed capital across various asset classes and vintages. To date, Beneficient has financed ~$10 million of liquidity transactions for LPs under the PLP program, with line of sight into further activity given a growing pipeline. Shifting to MHNW individuals and STMI investors, Beneficient continues to make inroads with the advisor community, family offices, and consultants. c. The company\u2019s Primary Capital Program (PCP) remains well positioned to support GP fundraising initiatives. Recent data suggests funds coming to market and those recently launched that are currently raising capital are targeting approximately $330 billion of new capital. The pipeline for new commitments continues to build, and we would expect Beneficient to close initial transactions in relatively short order. d. Beneficient\u2019s recently introduced Machine-Automated Pricing System (MAPS) streamlines pricing of alternative asset portfolios by leveraging the company\u2019s valuation algorithms and standardized documentation, thereby driving quicker processing/closing times for liquidity transactions. Following the integration of MAPS into Beneficient\u2019s AltAccess platform, transaction closing times can be further compressed to as few as 15 days compared to up to 15 months for more traditional processes (often catering to large GPs). Management plans to add additional functionality to MAPS in 2025, thereby further enhancing a key competitive advantage for BENF. e. Management remains focused on further extending the company\u2019s services by launching adjacent/related new businesses. More specifically, plans remain on track to launch a platform to facilitate alternative securities lending leveraging BENF\u2019s LP relationships, operational infrastructure, technology, and compliance/regulatory expertise. According to senior officials, the total addressable market for alternative securities lending could meet/exceed $60 billion per year, particularly given the likelihood for a step up in demand for liquidity in the near-term. 2. Strengthening the balance sheet: Beneficient recently announced a transaction that removed the cash redemption feature from a portion of the company\u2019s preferred securities, which triggered a redesignation of approximately $126 million of preferred equity as non-redeemable. In turn, $126 million of temporary equity was reclassified to permanent equity on Beneficient\u2019s balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. As a result, quarter-end shareholders\u2019 deficit stood at $13.2 million, down from $148.3 million as of June 30, 2024, with line of sight to a positive inflection in shareholders\u2019 equity, a key threshold for maintaining compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements. Furthermore, the company\u2019s registration statement was just declared effective by the SEC paving the way for the potential sale of up to 203 million shares of Class A common stock to finance alternative asset exchanges. 3. Fading technical selling overhang: As part of Beneficient\u2019s former parent company\u2019s Chapter 11 Plan, GWG assets \u2013 including equity interests in Beneficient \u2013 were transferred to the GWG Wind Down Trust (WDT). The Trust was formed for the purpose of selling BENF equity to satisfy debtors related to GWG\u2019s bankruptcy. As of 10/4/24, the GWG Wind Down Trust held 348,183 shares of BENF representing 7.6% of total Class A common stock outstanding \u2013 down from 28% in late August and ~90% at the time of BENF\u2019s IPO in 2023, thereby enhancing supply/demand trading dynamics for BENF, removing a considerable technical overhang on the stock, and broadening the shareholder base.

Services Beneficient Fri, Dec 6, 2024, 12:05 AM 6 min read In This Article: BENF BENFW Beneficient DALLAS, Dec. 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Beneficient (NASDAQ: BENF) (\u201cBen\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d),\u00a0 a technology-enabled platform providing exit opportunities and primary capital solutions and related trust and custody services to holders of alternative assets through its proprietary online platform AltAccess, announced it has entered into an agreement to acquire Mercantile Bank International Corp. (\u201cMercantile Bank\u201d), a Puerto Rico-based International Financial Entity (\u201cIFE\u201d), in exchange for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 million, which is payable in up to approximately 2.1 million shares of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock and cash. \u201cWe are very excited about the potential avenues for revenue growth that would be facilitated through this acquisition,\u201d said Beneficient. \u201cAcquiring Mercantile Bank would enable the Company to offer an expanded range of companion custody and other fee-based services that complement our existing businesses on a broader scale with the potential to generate additional cash flow in the near term. Our objective is to deliver additional alternative asset custody services to customers with the potential to generate higher fee rates than are generally available for traditional custody services. We also believe the acquisition has the potential to enhance and broaden our current offerings in ways that may open new international opportunities, allowing us to further democratize the market for illiquid alternative assets.\u201d IFEs are licensed and regulated by the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions of Puerto Rico (the \u201cOCIF\u201d) and may provide specific banking and other financial activity from Puerto Rico for persons, entities, and organizations around the globe that are non-residents of Puerto Rico. An IFE\u2019s authorized activities may include custody, clearing, and payments and related traditional and digital products and services and, as approved by the OCIF, traditional banking services, such as deposits, lending, investments, and trusts. Upon closing of the acquisition, the Company, which has primarily focused on meeting the needs of individual investors and small-to-midsized institutions, expects to expand its offering of custody services to also address the current needs of large institutional investors and the growing needs of third-party alternative trading systems and foreign securities exchanges. The acquisition would position Ben to offer alternative asset custody services that include, among other potential items, a companion line of business focused on issuing depositary receipts to assist holders of foreign investments gain access to the capital markets of additional international jurisdictions. The Company believes these alternative asset custody services may yield higher fee assessments than more traditional custody offerings. Story Continues The Company expects this companion business line to begin generating custody and depositary receipt issuance fee-based revenue and cash flow during calendar year 2025 that it would deploy to fund Ben\u2019s ongoing operations and ultimately our core alternative asset liquidity product offerings. The acquisition reflects Beneficient\u2019s execution on its objective of expanding its alternative asset custody fee-based service offerings to third parties and institutional investors. Closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among other things, approval by OCIF, and is anticipated to be completed in the second calendar quarter of 2025.

Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 Beneficient Fri, Nov 15, 2024, 12:45 AM 35 min read In This Article: BENF BENFW Beneficient Reports Second Quarter of Positive GAAP Net Income Maintains Cost Efficient Operating Profile DALLAS, Nov. 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Beneficient (NASDAQ: BENF) (\u201cBen\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) , a technology-enabled financial services holding company that provides liquidity and related trust and custody services to holders of alternative assets, today reported its financial results for the fiscal 2025 second quarter, which ended September\u00a030, 2024. Commenting on the fiscal 2025 second quarter results, Beneficient management said: \u201cWe are pleased to report our second consecutive profitable quarter as a public company, which we believe positions Ben as a leading solution for liquidity and primary capital in large and growing private investment markets. With our Board of Directors having authorized up to $5 billion of fiduciary financings to Customer ExAlt Trusts through ExchangeTrust transactions, our platform is designed for substantial growth as new opportunities are identified and negotiated. We believe that our comprehensive model will enable stockholders to benefit from the range of trust, custody and other services we provide as well as the underlying performance of the private equity assets held in trust. \u201cAdditionally, we are pleased to have strengthened our balance sheet through a previously announced transaction whereby our subsidiary Beneficient Company Holdings, L.P. redesignated approximately $125.5 million of its preferred equity as non-redeemable. As a result of the transaction, which was approved by the Company\u2019s founders holding the majority of the preferred equity, Beneficient reclassified approximately $125.5 million of temporary equity to permanent equity as of September 30, 2024.\u201d Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 and Recent Highlights (for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2024 or as noted): Reported investments with a fair value of $335.0 million, increased from $329.1 million at the end of our prior fiscal year, served as collateral for Ben Liquidity's net loan portfolio of $260.7 million and $256.2 million, respectively. Revenues increased to $8.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to $(42.8) million in the same quarter of fiscal 2024. On a year-to-date basis, revenues for fiscal 2025 were $18.6 million as compared to $(45.5) million for fiscal 2024. Operating expenses declined to $22.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, which included a non-cash goodwill impairment of $0.3 million, as compared to $339.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, which included a non-cash goodwill impairment of $306.7 million. On a year-to-date basis, operating expenses for fiscal 2025 were $(12.0) million, which included the release of a loss contingency accrual of $55.0 million and non-cash goodwill impairment of $3.7 million, as compared to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2024, which included non-cash goodwill impairment of $1.4 billion. Excluding the non-cash goodwill impairment in each period, operating expenses declined 31.9% to $22.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to $32.3 million in the same period of fiscal 2024. On a year-to-date basis, excluding the non-cash goodwill impairment and the loss contingency release in each period, as applicable, operating expenses were $39.3 million for the first half of fiscal 2025 as compared to $89.2 million for the first half of fiscal 2024. Improved permanent equity from a deficit of $148.3 million as of June 30, 2024 to a deficit of $13.2 million as of September 30, 2024 through a combination of redesignating approximately $125.5 million of temporary equity to permanent equity and net income allocable to permanent equity classified securities of $5.3 million during the current fiscal period. Story Continues Loan Portfolio As a result of executing on our business plan of providing financing for liquidity, or early investment exits, for alternative asset marketplace participants, Ben organically develops a balance sheet comprised largely of loans collateralized by a well- diversified alternative asset portfolio that is expected to grow as Ben successfully executes on its core business. Ben\u2019s balance sheet strategy for ExAlt Loan origination is built on the theory of the portfolio endowment model for the fiduciary financings we make by utilizing our patent-pending computer implemented technologies branded as OptimumAlt. Our OptimumAlt endowment model balance sheet approach guides diversification of our fiduciary financings across seven asset classes of alternative assets, over 11 industry sectors in which alternative asset managers invest, and at least six countrywide exposures and multiple vintages of dates of investment into the private funds and companies. As of September\u00a030, 2024, Ben\u2019s loan portfolio was supported by a highly diversified alternative asset collateral portfolio providing diversification across approximately 240 private market funds and approximately 800 investments across various asset classes, industry sectors and geographies. This portfolio includes exposure to some of the most exciting, sought after private company names worldwide, such as the largest private space exploration company, an innovative software and payment systems provider, a venture capital firm investing in waste-to-energy and clean energy technologies, a technology company providing Net Zero solutions in the production of advanced biofuels, a designer and manufacturer of shaving products, a large online store for women's clothes and other fashionable accessories that has announced intentions to go public, a mobile banking services provider, and others. Figure 1: Portfolio Diversification Diversification Using Principal Loan Balance, Net of Allowance for Credit Losses As of September\u00a030, 2024, the charts below present the ExAlt Loan portfolio\u2019s relative exposure by certain characteristics (percentages determined by aggregate fiduciary ExAlt Loan portfolio principal balance net of allowance for credit losses, which includes the exposure to interests in certain of our former affiliates composing part of the Fiduciary Loan Portfolio). ExAlt Loan Portfolio Charts As of September\u00a030, 2024. Represents the characteristics of professionally managed funds and investments in the Collateral (defined as follows) portfolio. The Collateral for the ExAlt Loans in the loan portfolio is comprised of a diverse portfolio of direct and indirect interests (through various investment vehicles, including, limited partnership interests and private and public equity and debt securities, which include our and our affiliates\u2019 or our former affiliates\u2019 securities), primarily in third-party, professionally managed private funds and investments. Loan balances used to calculate the percentages reported in the pie charts are loan balances net of any allowance for credit losses, and as of September\u00a030, 2024, the total allowance for credit losses was $315 million, for a total gross loan balance of $576 million and a loan balance net of allowance for credit losses of $261 million. Business Segments: Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 Ben Liquidity Ben Liquidity offers simple, rapid and cost-effective liquidity products through the use of our proprietary financing and trust structure, or the \u201cCustomer ExAlt Trusts,\u201d which facilitate the exchange of a customer\u2019s alternative assets for consideration. Ben Liquidity recognized $12.0 million of interest income for the fiscal second quarter, an increase of 10.4% from the quarter ended June\u00a030, 2024, primarily due to a slightly higher carrying value of loan receivables, which was driven by compounding interest, offset by an increase in the allowance for credit losses. Operating income for the fiscal second quarter was $2.9 million, improved from an operating loss of $0.5 million for the quarter ended June\u00a030, 2024. Adjusted operating income (1) for the fiscal second quarter was $2.9 million, improved from adjusted operating loss (1) of $0.5 million in the quarter ended June\u00a030, 2024. The increase in adjusted operating income (1) was primarily due to lower credit loss adjustments along with the higher revenues noted above. Ben Custody Ben Custody provides full-service trust and custody administration services to the trustees of certain of the Customer ExAlt Trusts, which own the exchanged alternative assets following liquidity transactions in exchange for fees payable quarterly calculated as a percentage of assets in custody. NAV of alternative assets and other securities held in custody by Ben Custody during the fiscal second quarter increased to $385.1 million as of September\u00a030, 2024, compared to $381.2 million as of March\u00a031, 2024. The increase was driven by unrealized gains on existing assets, principally related adjustments to the relative share held in custody of the respective fund\u2019s NAV based on updated financial information received from the funds\u2019 investment manager or sponsor during the period, offset by distributions during the period. Revenues applicable to Ben Custody were $5.4 million for the fiscal second quarter, compared to $5.4 million for the quarter ended June\u00a030, 2024. The similar amount of revenues for these periods was a result of stable NAV of alternative assets and other securities held in custody at the beginning of each applicable period, when such fees are calculated. Operating income for the fiscal second quarter increased to $4.3 million, from $1.3 million for the quarter ended June\u00a030, 2024. The increase was primarily due to lower non-cash goodwill impairment in the fiscal second quarter of $0.3 million as compared to non-cash goodwill impairment of $3.1 million for the quarter ended June\u00a030, 2024. Adjusted operating income (1) for the fiscal second quarter was $4.6 million, compared to adjusted operating income (1) of $4.4 million for the quarter ended June\u00a030, 2024. The increase was primarily due to slightly higher revenues and slightly lower operating expenses. Business Segments: Through Six Months Ended Fiscal 2025 Ben Liquidity Ben Liquidity recognized $22.8 million of interest income for the six months ended September\u00a030, 2024, down 8.8% compared to the prior year period, primarily due to lower loans, net of the allowance for credit losses, resulting from higher levels of non-accrual loans and loan prepayments, partially offset by new loans originated. Operating income was $2.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, increased from an operating loss of $1.2 billion in the prior year period. The prior period loss was driven by non-cash goodwill impairment totaling $1.1 billion and credit losses largely related to securities of our former parent company. Adjusted operating income (1) was $2.4 million for the six months ended September\u00a030, 2024 compared to adjusted operating loss (1) of $14.3 million in the prior year period with the increase in adjusted operating income (1) primarily related to lower credit loss adjustments recognized in the current period and lower interest expense. Ben Custody Ben Custody revenues were $10.8 million for the six months ended September\u00a030, 2024, down 17.6%, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to lower NAV of alternative assets and other securities held in custody. Operating income was $5.6 million for the six months ended September\u00a030, 2024 compared to operating loss of $270.8 million in the prior year period, with the increase in operating income principally related to a significantly larger non-cash goodwill impairment in the prior year period of $281.8 million as compared to $3.4 million in the current year period. Adjusted operating income (1) for the six months ended September\u00a030, 2024 was $9.0 million, compared to adjusted operating income (1) of $10.9 million in the prior year period with the decrease in adjusted operating income (1) primarily due to lower revenue related to lower NAV of alternative assets and other securities held in custody and slightly lower operating expenses during the current fiscal year period. Capital and Liquidity As of September\u00a030, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $4.5 million and total debt of $124.1 million. Distributions received from alternative assets and other securities held in custody totaled $12.5 million for the six months ended September\u00a030, 2024, compared to $26.3 million for the same period of fiscal 2024. Total investments (at fair value) of $335.0 million at September\u00a030, 2024 supported Ben Liquidity's loan portfolio. (1) Represents a non-GAAP financial measure.

We present these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe it helps investors understand underlying trends in our business and facilitates an understanding of our operating performance from period to period because it facilitates a comparison of our recurring core business operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, U.S. GAAP. Our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate such items in the same way. We define adjusted revenue as revenue adjusted to exclude the effect of mark-to-market adjustments on related party equity securities that were acquired both prior to and during the Collateral Swap, which on August 1, 2023, became interests in the GWG Wind Down Trust. Adjusted Segment Revenues attributable to Ben's Equity Holders is the same as \"adjusted revenues\" related to the aggregate of the Ben Liquidity, Ben Custody, and Corporate/Other Business Segments, which are the segments that impact the net income (loss) attributable to all equity holders of Beneficient, including equity holders of Beneficient's subsidiary, Beneficient Company Holdings, L.P. Adjusted operating income (loss) represents GAAP operating income (loss), adjusted to exclude the effect of the adjustments to revenue as described above, credit losses on related party available-for-sale debt securities that were acquired in the Collateral Swap which on August 1, 2023, became interests in the GWG Wind Down Trust, and receivables from a related party that filed for bankruptcy and certain notes receivables originated during our formative transactions, non-cash asset impairment, share-based compensation expense, and legal, professional services, and public relations costs related to the GWG Holdings bankruptcy, lawsuits, a defunct product offering, and certain employee matters, including fees & loss contingency accruals (releases) incurred in arbitration with a former director. Adjusted Segment Operating Income (Loss) attributable to Ben's Equity Holders is the same as \"adjusted operating income (loss)\" related to the aggregate of the Ben Liquidity, Ben Custody, and Corporate/Other Business Segments, which are the segments that impact the net income (loss) attributable to all equity holders of Beneficient, including equity holders of Beneficient's subsidiary, Beneficient Company Holdings, L.P. These non-GAAP financial measures are not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. They are unaudited and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, GAAP revenues or GAAP operating income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance. Uses of cash flows that are not reflected in adjusted operating income (loss) or adjusted segment operating income (loss) attributable to Ben's Equity Holders include capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, and other expenses, which can be significant. As a result, adjusted operating income (loss) and/or adjusted segment operating income (loss) attributable to Ben's Equity Holders should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity. Because of these limitations, Adjusted Revenues, Adjusted Operating Income (Loss), Adjusted Segment Revenues attributable to Ben's Equity Holders and Adjusted Segment Operating Income (Loss) attributable to Ben's Equity Holders should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using Adjusted Revenues, Adjusted Operating Income (Loss), Adjusted Segment Revenues attributable to Ben's Equity Holders and Adjusted Segment Operating Income (Loss) attributable to Ben's Equity Holders on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures set forth above and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.
