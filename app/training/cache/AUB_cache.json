Positive Points Atlantic Union Bankshares Corp ( NYSE:AUB ) successfully closed the acquisition of American National Bankshares and announced a proposed acquisition of Sandy Spring Bancorp, which is expected to enhance market presence and product offerings. The company received merger approvals from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and is awaiting further approvals, indicating progress in the merger process. AUB reported a 29% increase in total loan production quarter-over-quarter, demonstrating strong lending activity. The macroeconomic environment in AUB's operating regions remains favorable, with unemployment rates below the national average, supporting economic stability. AUB's adjusted operating earnings for the full year 2024 were $241.3 million, reflecting solid financial performance despite challenging conditions. Negative Points AUB's fourth-quarter earnings were negatively impacted by a higher provision for loan losses due to a $13.1 million specific reserve on a problematic C&I loan. The net interest margin (NIM) experienced compression due to funding mix dynamics and lower loan yields, impacting profitability. Noninterest expense increased due to merger-related costs and higher salaries and benefits, affecting overall cost management. The company experienced elevated commercial real estate payoffs, which could impact future loan growth. AUB's credit quality was affected by an atypical event involving a misrepresentation of a borrowing base, leading to increased nonperforming assets. Story Continues Q & A Highlights Q : With the Department of Government Efficiency potentially influencing economic activity in Virginia and Maryland, how might these developments impact Atlantic Union Bankshares' business model? A : John Asbury, CEO, explained that while the exact impacts are uncertain, the return of federal workers to offices and a hiring freeze could benefit the local economy. The Greater Washington area, with its low unemployment and affluent population, is expected to absorb any federal workforce reductions into the private sector. The administration's pro-national defense stance is likely to benefit markets, especially government contractors, which Atlantic Union finances. Q : Can you walk us through the drivers of organic net interest margin (NIM) expansion for 2025, and are there any changes to the pro forma Sandy Springs guide? A : Robert Gorman, CFO, noted that the NIM expansion is expected due to fixed-rate loan repricing and lower CD rates. The bank anticipates two Fed rate cuts in 2025, impacting variable rate loans. The Sandy Spring acquisition might see a combined NIM closer to 4% due to purchase accounting accretion. Q : How should we think about the impact of the Sandy Spring acquisition on the margin, considering the move in rates since the deal was announced? A : Gorman stated that higher rates since the deal announcement could lead to more accretion income and a slight increase in tangible book value dilution. The combined margin might see a lift, with accretion income potentially closer to 4%. Q : Regarding the reserve build this quarter, was it primarily related to one C&I loan, and what is the outlook for reserves next year? A : Gorman confirmed that the reserve build was mainly due to a specific C&I loan. The bank is conservatively assuming a modest reserve build for 2025, with no significant changes in asset quality outlook. Q : Is there potential for the Sandy Spring acquisition to close earlier than April 1, depending on regulatory approvals? A : Asbury mentioned that while regulatory approvals are expected soon, the bank prefers not to close in March due to the complexities of closing a merger at the end of a quarter. The plan remains to close on April 1 for a cleaner transition. For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .

We will also make forward-looking statements on today's call which are not statements of historical fact and are subject to risks and uncertainties.

We undertake no obligation to publicly revise or update any forward-looking statement. And please refer to our earnings release and our slide presentation issued today and our other SEC filings for a further discussion of the company's risk factors and other important information regarding our forward-looking statements, including factors that could cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statement. All comments made during today's call are subject to that safe harbor statement. And at the end of the call, we will take questions from the research analyst community. And now I'll turn the call over to John. Story continues John Asbury Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2024 was a good year and a consequential year for Atlantic Union. We were excited to close our acquisition of American National Bankshares on April 1, and we continue to be impressed with our new and expanded markets and how well the two companies came together as one since closing. And on October 21, we added to the excitement by announcing our proposed acquisition of only Maryland-based Sandy Spring Bancorp. Let me begin with some perspective on the status report on the proposed acquisition since last quarter. The acquisition of Sandy Spring will join the number 1 regional depository market share bank in Maryland with the number 1 original depository market share bank in Virginia. In our view, not only has there never been such a regional bank franchise headquartered in the lower Mid-Atlantic, but there may also never be another, as we believe our combined franchise will not be able to be replicated in our footprint. We believe the proposed acquisition will benefit our customers and markets with an expanded and even more convenient branch network, enhanced product offerings, a robust community benefit plan and access to more capitals. We also believe it will benefit our teammates with expanded career opportunities, resources and capabilities. And finally, we believe it will benefit our shareholders by positioning us well to deliver differentiated financial performance. As for the status of the merger, we were pleased to receive our merger approvals from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond on January 13, seven weeks after filing applications. We are awaiting approval from the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions in the Maryland Office of Financial Regulation. Assuming receipt of remaining regulatory approvals, each company's respective shareholder and stockholder approvals as applicable at the special meetings to be held on February 5, and the satisfaction of other closing conditions, we expect to close the transaction on April 1 of this year. Our merger integration planning process is well underway with the Sandy Spring team and from the meetings I've attended, I remain highly confident in our cultural compatibility, the strategic logic of the merger and its potential. We've been delighted by both teams' enthusiasm over what we believe our combined franchise will offer to our customers and our communities. I'll now comment on the macroeconomic conditions in our markets and then share a few thoughts on the fourth quarter. The macroeconomic environment remains favorable in our footprint, and we do not expect that to change in the near term. Our markets continue to appear healthy, and our lending pipelines imply we should expect mid-single-digit annualized loan growth in 2025 within the current AUB franchise. We believe that a good indicator of economic health is employment, and the three states where we operate, continue to have unemployment rates better than the last reported national average unemployment rate of 4.1%. In our case, unemployment rates by state for the last reported period of November are 3.0% for Virginia, 3.1% from Maryland and 3.7% for North Carolina. Virginia is our largest market, and our governor's summed up the state economy well recently by saying the economy is strong, very strong, and we agree. We're confident in the economy in all our markets and with our increased presence in North Carolina and our planned expansion in Maryland with the Sandy Spring merger, we believe we do and will operate in some of the most attractive and stable markets in the country. Turning now to quarterly results. Here are a few financial highlights for the fourth quarter and the full year 2024. We continue to be on a moderate growth path for both deposits and loans. Point-to-point loan growth for the fourth quarter was approximately 3% annualized. As you can see by comparing point-to-point growth to the average for the quarter, loan growth skewed to the back half of the quarter and accelerated following the elections and the Fed rate cut in December. Deposit growth in the fourth quarter was approximately 2% annualized after reducing brokered deposits by more than $200 million. Noninterest-bearing deposit average balances were about even quarter-to-quarter, and point-to-point decreased modestly to approximately 21% of total deposits. It's a typical pattern to see a seasonal drop in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts at year-end. With the Federal Reserve rate cuts, we've been fairly aggressive in moving deposit rates lower, as you can see from the decline in the cost of deposits. For some of our larger negotiated rate depositors, we were able to reduce deposit rates by more than the latest Fed cut, which we believe will have additional benefits to the net interest margin in the first quarter of 2025. In past quarters, we've been able to pay down overnight FHLB borrowings with surplus funds from some of the larger accounts that have significant fluctuations in the normal course of the cash operating cycles. We can no longer do that, since we significantly reduced our overnight FHLB borrowings during the quarter. This funding mix dynamic contributed to some of the quarter's NIM compression. And speaking of net interest margin, because we're still mildly asset-sensitive, the expectation that the Fed may have fewer rate cuts than previously expected or perhaps none bodes well for us, and should be a net positive for AUB's margin. Our loan growth was on top of the highest quarterly runoff we've seen since before the pandemic. We saw elevated payoffs or pay downs among both our C&I client base, especially in government contracting and larger businesses and in commercial real estate. We view the elevated commercial real estate payoffs, which we predicted last quarter, is demonstrating that CRE markets in our footprint, and that there's ample liquidity and demand for commercial real estate sales and refinances into permanent markets. That's very encouraging to see. The good news is that total loan production increased 29% quarter-over-quarter, enough to overcome the spike in payoffs and allow for modest loan growth. C&I utilization this quarter increased slightly from the last quarter in the prior year's fourth quarter. Loan production in the fourth quarter was weighted nearly two-third from existing clients and about one-third from new clients, demonstrating we continue to grow our client base. Production continued to favor C&I over commercial real estate, with about 60% of production coming from C&I. We were pleased to see an increase in production and construction and land development for the third consecutive quarter, which we view as another sign of relatively healthy commercial real estate markets in our footprint. Rob will provide the details around quarterly results, but I will note that the fourth quarter earnings were negatively impacted by a higher provision for loan losses driven by a $13.1 million specific reserve on a $27.7 million asset-based C&I loan involving an apparent misrepresentation of its borrowing base, which was identified at year-end. This individual credit primarily accounted for the increase in nonperforming assets over the quarter, though NPAs remained low at approximately 0.32% of loans held for investment. Aside from this atypical event, credit remains solid, with only 3 basis points of net charge-offs this quarter and 5 basis points for the year. As I mentioned every quarter and have for about eight years, we do not consider the negligible losses we have seen over the past few years to be sustainable. We do expect to have occasional one-off losses, but generally not of the type or size we saw this quarter. We remain confident in our asset quality that we believe some normalization of our long run of historically low losses is inevitable. In sum, we're building out our unique franchise and realizing the financial benefits of the American National combination, which were unfortunately clouded this quarter by the specific credit reserve. As has been the case for some time, we expect economic uncertainty to continue, but we're optimistic in our outlook, and we believe we are well positioned for a successful 2025 and beyond. Atlantic Union is a story of transformation from a Virginia community bank to the largest regional bank headquartered in Virginia, to what will be the largest regional bank headquartered in lower Mid-Atlantic upon closing our proposed acquisition of Sandy Spring. Meanwhile, we remain more excited than ever about the growth opportunity in our North Carolina markets, and we're investing in them. We now have and are continuing to build the franchise we have long sought using our announced strategic plan as our guidepost. Now more than ever, Atlantic Union is a uniquely valuable franchise that is dense, diversified, traditional full-service bank with a strong brand and deep client relationships in stable and attractive markets. We also believe we have unmatched scarcity value in this region. I'll now turn the call over to Rob to cover the financial results for the quarter. Rob? Robert Gorman Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I'd now like to take a few minutes to provide you with some details of Atlantic Union's financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. Please note that for the most part, my commentary will focus on Atlantic Union's fourth quarter and 2024 financial results on a non-GAAP adjusted operating basis, which in the fourth quarter excludes $7 million in pretax merger-related costs and for the full year excludes the additional FDIC special assessment of $840,000 in the first quarter, the pretax loss on the sale of American National securities of $6.5 million in the second quarter. The effect of the $4.8 million valuation allowance for deferred taxes that was charged to the income tax expense in the second quarter and the pretax merger-related cost of $40 million incurred in 2024 associated with our merger with American National and our proposed merger with Sandy Spring. As a reminder, the full year 2024 non-GAAP adjusted operating results have not been adjusted to exclude the $13.2 million negative pretax impact of the CECL initial provision for credit loss expense on purchased non-credit deteriorated for non-PCD loans acquired from American National, which represents the CECL double count of the non-PCD credit mark. It does not also include the $1.4 million negative pretax impact of unfunded commitments acquired from American National. It should also be noted that the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding increased during the fourth quarter, driven by the dilutive accounting impact of the forward sale of our common stock in October under the treasury stock method of accounting, which requires the dilutive potential common shares related to the forward sale to be included in the diluted weighted average shares even though the underlying common stock has not been issued to date. This impact is calculated by taking the difference between the average market price of AUB stock in the quarter and the forward stock price multiplied by the number of shares underlying the forward sale and dividing that result by AUB's average market price for the quarter. That said, in the fourth quarter, reported net income available to common shareholders was $54.8 million, and diluted earnings per common share was $0.60. For the full year 2024, reported net income available to common shareholders was $197.3 million, and diluted earnings per common share were $2.24. Adjusted operating earnings available to common shareholders were $61.4 million or $0.67 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter, which resulted in an adjusted operating return on tangible common equity of 15.3% and adjusted operating return on assets of 103 basis points and an adjusted operating efficiency ratio of 52.7% in the fourth quarter. For the full year, adjusted operating earnings available to common shareholders were $241.3 million or $2.74 per common share, which resulted in an adjusted operating return on common equity of 16.12%, an adjusted operating return on assets of 106 basis points and an adjusted operating efficiency ratio of 53.3% in 2024. Turning to credit loss reserves. At the end of the fourth quarter, the total allowance of credit losses was $193.7 million, which was an increase of approximately $16.1 million from the third quarter primarily due to the specific reserve John mentioned earlier, continued uncertainty in the economic outlook on certain loan portfolios and organic loan growth in the fourth quarter. The total allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment increased to 105 basis points at the end of the fourth quarter. The provision for credit losses of $17.5 million in the fourth quarter was up from $2.6 million in the prior quarter, primarily driven by the specific reserve and slightly higher net charge-offs during the quarter. Net charge-offs increased to $1.4 million or only 3 basis points annualized in the fourth quarter, but that was up from $666,000 or 1 basis point annualized in the third quarter. Now turning to the pretax pre-provision components of the income statement for the fourth quarter. Tax equivalent net interest income was $187 million, which was an increase of $208,000 from the third quarter. The increase in net interest income from the prior quarter reflects the net impact of a $5.6 million decline in interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and a $5.4 million decrease in interest income on earning assets. The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to a $4.7 million decrease in borrowings expense as a result of $312 million in lower average short-term borrowings and the impact of lower deposit rates in the quarter. The decrease in interest income on earning assets is due primarily to a $9 million decline in income on loans held for investment driven by lower loan yields on our variable rate loans resulting from the impact of the Federal Reserve interest rate cuts at the end of the third quarter and during the fourth quarter. The decline in loan interest income was partially offset by a $4.6 million increase in interest income from other earning assets as a result of a $402 million increase in average cash and other earning asset balances. The fourth quarter's tax equivalent net interest margin was [3.33%], a decline of 5 basis points from the previous quarter, primarily due to lower core loan yields driven by decreases in variable rate loan yields, partially offset by lower cost of funds and an increase in yields on cash and other earning assets. Additionally, the reversal of accrued interest on the specific reserve loan negatively impacted margin by approximately 1 basis point in the quarter. Earning asset yields for the fourth quarter decreased 20 basis points to 5.74% compared to the third quarter of 2024, and the cost of funds decreased by 15 basis points to 2.41% compared to the prior quarter. The 20 basis points decline in earning asset yield is due primarily to the decrease in the loan portfolio yield, which was lower by 21 basis points from 6.35% to 6.14% during the fourth quarter, driven by lower yields on our variable rate loans and a decrease in the securities portfolio yield from 3.92% to 3.87%. These declines were partially offset by an increase in yield on cash and other earning assets, which increased from 3.48% to 4.27% during the fourth quarter. A 15 basis points decrease in the fourth quarter's cost of funds to 2.41% was due primarily to a 42 basis points decline in the cost of borrowings to 4.87%, a 9 basis points decline in the cost of deposits of 2.48% and a favorable shift in the deposit and short-term borrowing funding mix. Noninterest income increased $941,000 to $35.2 million for the fourth quarter, primarily driven by a $3.6 million increase in loan-related interest rate swap fees due to an increase in transaction volumes, which was partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in bank-owned life insurance income, driven by debt benefits received in the prior quarter and a $770,000 decrease in other operating income primarily due to a decline in equity method investment income. Reported noninterest expense increased $7.1 million to $129.7 million for the fourth quarter, primarily driven by a $5.6 million increase in pretax merger-related costs associated with the pending Sandy Spring acquisition. Adjusted operating interest expense, which excludes merger-related costs and amortization of intangible assets in both quarters increased $1.6 million to $117 million for the fourth quarter, driven by a $1.8 million increase in salaries and benefits expense primarily due to increases in variable incentive compensation expense and self-insured related group insurance costs, as well as a $1.4 million increase in professional service fees related to strategic projects that occurred during the fourth quarter. These increases were partially offset by a $1.7 million decrease in franchise and other taxes. At December 31, 2024, loans held for investment net of deferred fees and costs were $18.5 billion, which was an increase of $133 million or 2.9% on an annualized basis from September 30, 2024, primarily driven by increases in construction and land development and commercial and industrial loan portfolios, partially offset by declines in the multifamily real estate loan portfolio. On a pro forma basis, as if the American National balances were acquired on December 1 -- December 31, 2023, loans held for investment increased $661 million or approximately 3.7% for the full year, excluding the impact of the acquisition's fair value loan marks. At December 31, 2024, total deposits stood at $20.4 billion, which was an increase of $92 million or 1.8% annualized from the prior quarter due to increases in interest-bearing customer deposits, partially offset by decreases in demand deposits and broker deposits. On a pro forma basis, as if the American National balances were acquired on December 31, 2023, deposits increased $974 million or approximately 5% for the full year. At the end of the fourth quarter, Atlantic Union Bankshares and Atlantic Union Bank's regulatory capital ratios were comfortably above well-capitalized levels. In addition, on an adjusted basis, we remain well capitalized as of the end of the fourth quarter if you include the negative impact of AOCI and held to maturity securities unrealized losses in the calculation of the regulatory capital ratios. During the fourth quarter, the company paid a common stock dividend of $0.34 per common share, which was an increase of 6.3% for both the third quarter of '24 and fourth quarter of '23 dividend amounts. As noted on Slide 13, our full year of 2025 financial outlook for AUB on a stand-alone basis, excluding the financial impact of the pending Sandy Spring acquisition, is as follows. We expect mid-single-digit loan to deposit growth for the full year. Fully taxable equivalent net interest income for the full year is projected to come in between $775 million and $800 million. We are projecting that the full year fully tax equivalent net interest margin will be in a range between 3.45% and 3.6%, driven by our baseline assumption that the Federal Reserve Bank will cut the Fed funds rate by 25 basis points twice in 2025, and the yield curve will steepen throughout 2025. The projected expansion of the net interest margin from current levels is expected to be primarily driven by the impact of increasing yields on our fixed rate loan portfolio as the back book continues to reprice higher, as well as by the impact of lower time deposit rates is approximately $3.3 billion at a current average interest rate of approximately 4.4% will mature over the next six months. These favorable NIM impacts will be partially offset by lower variable rate loan yields, driven by the Fed funds rate cuts anticipated. On a full year basis, adjusted net -- adjusted operating noninterest income is expected to be between $125 million and $135 million. Adjusted operating noninterest expenses, which exclude the amortization of intangible assets expense of approximately $20 million for the full year, are estimated to be in the range of $475 million to $490 million. In summary, Atlantic Union delivered solid operating financial results in the fourth quarter despite challenging banking and operating environment we are effectively managing through. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to continue to generate sustainable profitable growth and to build long-term value for our shareholders in 2025 and beyond. Let me now turn the call over -- back over to Bill Cimino for questions from our analyst community. Question and Answer Session Bill Cimino Thanks, Rob. And Michelle, our first caller, please. Operator (Operator Instructions) Russell Gunther, Stephens Inc. This is [Nick Lorenzo]. I'm just going in for Russell today. I wanted to start off on the macro side. And with the Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE, playing a growing role in streamlining federal operations and even potentially influencing economic activity in Virginia and Maryland, can you guys provide any insight into how these developments might impact your business model? John Asbury Yes. Let me -- I'll give you some big picture perspective. And obviously, we don't know exactly what is going to happen up there. It's certainly been a busy week in Washington with the numerous executive orders coming out. Obviously, we saw the mandate that came out this week to return federal workers to the office and to put a hiring freeze on. A concept of a hiring freeze is something that most private companies understand. We've done that before ourselves. Having federal workers come back to the office is something that has been long requested by the Mayor of Washington, D.C., and we do believe that that will be an economic benefit to the area. It will help the metro, it will help small businesses, et cetera. The incoming administration has been clear that they are committed to a safe, clean and vibrant Washington, D.C., and we think that will help. Now let me give you some other kind of broad comments. We are all for improving government efficiency and reducing federal spending. That is a good objective, and we wish them much success. If the new administration can reduce the federal workforce in some way, shape or form, which is, frankly, easier said than done, given the essential services provided in the nation's capital, we'd expect to see most of those jobs absorbed into the private sector. And for perspective, the Greater Washington metropolitan statistical area is the sixth largest MSA in the country with a population of 6.3 million people. Its current unemployment rate is 3.2%, and it's one of the most affluent and highly educated regions of the country. Also, to size this, there are 373,000 federal workers in the Washington MSA, and we do question, as mentioned, exactly how many of those can actually go away over time. So the realities of the geopolitical situation and incoming administration's pro national defense stance is likely going to benefit our markets. And I think that's important to understand. And that includes the type of government contractors we finance, which typically provide essential services to what we call the three-letter agencies such as Department of Defense, National Security Agency, et cetera. We would expect to see more funding for those types of agencies. And also, for anyone who is all familiar with the Greater Washington region, whether you've spent time there or lived in the area and observed it like we have, there's no question that traditionally, a change in administration is an economic stimulus for Washington region. Go find a hotel in Washington, D.C. right now, and you'll find out what I mean. Interestingly, the Washington Business Journal just reported that the sales of high-end homes in 2024 in the Greater Washington region hit a record high, which is interesting. And then I think the last point that I'll make -- and I'll focus on Sandy Spring for a moment -- is to remember, while there's any number of sort of Greater Washington commercial real estate-oriented banks, don't confuse that with Sandy Spring, which is the Maryland Bank. They are a geographically compact franchise that exclusively operates in what's referred to as the Washington-Baltimore combined statistical area, that has a population of 10 million people. And that's comparable to Chicago and Northern California, the San Francisco CSAs. The unemployment rate in that combined statistical area is 3.1%. And it is broadly, one of the most highly educated and affluent markets in the country. So this is a big market. It is a diverse market in terms of its industries. The federal government influences -- but it's not just about the federal government. And so we see opportunity. Time will tell exactly what's going to go on up there. Clearly, there's a lot of conversation and press around large office buildings and the government liquidating their very large, old buildings which are underutilized. That doesn't impact us. We don't perceive that as impacting Sandy Spring because [not of the] robust finance things that look like that. So we'll see how it plays out over time, but it is the nation's capital, and it's not going away. Okay. Got it. That's great color. Now just switching gears. I appreciate the organic NIM outlook for 2025, but could you walk us through the cadence and drivers of organic NIM expansion? And then are there any changes to the pro forma Sandy Springs guide of 3.75% to 3.85%? Robert Gorman Yeah. So in terms of our guidance and how to get there at the expansion that we're suggesting, as we noted in my comments, what we're looking at is that there will be two cuts from the Fed -- the Fed funds rate in 2025, expect that in the second half of the year. But in terms of between now and then, we are seeing that our back book fixed rate loan portfolio is repricing higher, and -- by [125] or 150 basis points or so. And we've got about a $1 billion, maybe $800 million to $900 million of maturing fixed rate loans per quarter in 2025 repricing at, call it, [1.25, 1.50] on a basis point perspective. So that's helpful. We do see there's a bit of a lag on our deposit costs coming down in the quarter. But we do expect that we will continue to reduce our CD book from a rate paid perspective. As I mentioned, we have $3.3 billion of maturing CDs in the first six months of 2025. Those maturing CDs paid 4.4% currently. Our current CD offerings are more in the 3.75% to 4%. So you'll see a lower cost associated with those maturing CDs. And there's other factors in that, but those are the big drivers that we expect to see NIM expansion in 2025. As regards to Sandy Spring, we really don't see much change in that outlook in terms of the 2025 impact of Sandy Spring, it might be a bit higher than the numbers you're citing, closer to the four handle, if you include purchase accounting accretion, which could be a bit higher based on rates going up a bit since we announced the deal, there should be a bit more accretion. So I would say, between 3.75% and 4% would be the right numbers on the combined basis. John Asbury Rob, could you speak to what we saw NIM do over the course of the quarter? My perspective is that we absorbed a 100 basis points decrease in rates because we saw 100 basis points of Fed cuts, 50 basis points in September, which fully impacted us in the quarter, 25 basis points in November, 25 basis points in December. We're still mildly asset sensitive. So when rates are cut, it creates a bit of a lag in terms of you have the loan book reprices and then, of course, we push rates down. So there was a bit of a lag effect. So can you speak to that? Robert Gorman And just -- add just a comment on the quarter. I should also point out that if you look at net interest spread for the fourth quarter, even though we were down on NIM, the net interest spread was basically flat quarter-to-quarter. So earning asset yields came down 20 basis points. The interest on interest-bearing liabilities came down 20 basis points, kind of so net even. We did see some lower levels of free funding related to DDA, which kind of impacted that decline in the margin impacted that. But in terms of what you just mentioned, John, yeah. So if you look at November to December, we're basically flat from a net interest margin perspective. So we're seeing that as rates are coming down and lag on the deposit costs are picking up. And that should continue into 2025 as well. John Asbury So I feel like we've got a pretty good running start on this, and that should have been bought for us. We also pointed out a couple of technical things like understanding that we had about a basis point of NIM go with the onetime reversal of interest on the one credit that had the specific reserve. We did -- there are a few technical issues I commented on, which is we used to be able to take some larger sort of volatile deposits with larger clients to pay off overnight borrowings. We don't really have that anymore typically. And so we were able to reduce what we paid on those accounts more than the rate cut, and that happened in December. And that actually will impact the NIM. Robert Gorman Yeah, I have a really good success in engaging our commercial -- large commercial clients in terms of lowering those exception price deposits and -- to your point. So that should be picking up as we go into 2025. John Asbury So it's a pretty good setup for NIM expansion. Perfect. Well, that's all I have. Thanks for taking my questions. Bill Cimino Thank you. And Michelle, ready for our next caller, please. Operator Catherine Mealor, KBW. Catherine Mealor Just a question back on the margin. Just -- I think, Rob, you touched on this a little bit, but just wanted to dig into. Can you talk about just the impact of Sandy Spring, the acquisition? And how we should think about the move in rates since that deal was announced to where we are today? And that impact on kind of the core margin versus accretable yield and how that might impact the month? Robert Gorman Yeah. So -- yeah, on that question, Catherine, as you know, rates have moved up a bit since we announced the deal. So if we were to mark those loans in the balance sheet today, you'd see a bit of a higher mark, which will lead into more accretion income as we go forward. So the net impact of that is you might see a bit -- again, if we were to close the deal today and mark them today, might see a bit of a bit higher tangible book value dilution, but higher earnings, EPS accretion and interest accretion coming through. But the earn back would kind of stay in that 2% to 2.25% range. So in terms of the accretion impact, you'll see more impact, again, based on where rates are today. And marking the book than we have projected at the announcement just because rates have increased. So -- but in terms of the overall net interest margin, I think as I just mentioned, we probably see a bit of a lift in the combined margin, with accretion income more -- closer -- guiding up to more closer to the 4% range than what we might have guided to at announcement. Catherine Mealor Okay. And then how do we think about -- so the loan mark makes sense to me. So on the other side of the balance sheet, with less rate cuts, I would think there would be less ability to lower [SaaS] deposit costs as you kind of move through next year. How do you think about that as an offset? Robert Gorman Yeah. Well, one of the offsets there is also on the AUB side. We won't see -- 50% of our loan book is variable rate. We won't see as much impact on that. So it's kind of washing out, if you will, in terms of those when you combine the balance sheets. But we'll continue to be aggressive. Once we have the balance sheet combined and we close the transaction, we'll be looking at various deposit rate strategies to continue to bring the overall organization's deposit rates down, but specifically looking at Sandy Spring's network or franchise. John Asbury Catherine, 2 points. We're sort of a natural hedge to each other. They're modestly liability sensitive, we're modestly asset sensitive. So part of the pressure that we always experience when rates go down, they will lead to some extent. Now clearly, we're larger than they are. But at the same time, when rates don't go down or go up, that pressures them because on the other side of the equation. So it's a very good natural hedge for us both. And I will tell you that selfishly, if you asked us to choose what scenario do you choose for rates to do here with a focus on the net interest margin only, Rob, I would vote for leave them where they are. What would you vote for? Robert Gorman Yeah. Yeah, I would agree. John Asbury That's a positive scenario for us, but we are planning for two cuts from here in terms of the NIM guide that we've given you. Catherine Mealor Okay. That's very helpful. And maybe one other is on credit. It seems like the reserve build this quarter was really all related to that one C&I loan. It looks like you're building in a little bit of a cushion for a modest reserve build on a core basis next year. Just kind of thinking about that conservatively or anything that you're seeing that would drive that over the next year in particular? Robert Gorman Nothing particular -- nothing particularly is driving that, Catherine. At the end of this quarter, as you mentioned we're at [1.05], and we've guided to between [1 and 1.10]. That could be closer to the 1 versus the [1.10]. We haven't seen -- we don't really see anything else at this point in time. But it's basically a conservative assumption in our outlook. John Asbury Yes. Assuming the specific reserve works its way on to a charge-off, obviously, that brings down the reserve because obviously, by definition, it's specific to that credit. We guided to 10 bps to 15 bps of net charge-offs in 2024. We were at 5 bps. So my view is we are sort of contemplating an ultimate charge-off of whatever it may be associated with that particular credit. But otherwise, there's not a lot different in terms of our outlook for everything else. That's about asset quality. Robert Gorman That's right. In the charge-off outlook where we said 15 bps to 20 bps, that kind of builds in that there's a potential charge-off with the specific. So we don't know that for a fact yet. But we're anticipating that, and that's why the outlook has kind of increased a bit on the charge-off for 2025. Catherine Mealor Makes sense. Thank you very much. Operator Stephen Scouten, Piper Sandler. Stephen Scouten Just quick clarification on the expected closing of Sandy Spring. I think you said April 1. Shareholder vote, February 5. Is it possible that depending upon what you hear in the timing from Virginia and Maryland, that could close earlier? Or is it just -- is that going to stay the plan given conversion dates and other kind of internal plan? John Asbury Good question. We expect that we will hear soon from both Maryland and Virginia, everything is operating in the normal course. It is kind of interesting isn't it, that just for the record, the Federal Reserve came in faster than the states, which is not typically what we see. But everyone is going through their process. Let's assume that we get everything in in short order. I think the question is, could we close in the month of March? Yes, we could. Would we do that? No, we would not. Why would we not do that? Because it's very complicated to close a merger in the last month of a quarter. We could do it, but we choose not to do it. Do you... Robert Gorman Yes, I agree with that. Yes, it's a lot cleaner to do it on the first of a new quarter. There's a lot of accounting complexities and reporting requirements associated with a stub period in one quarter. So it's just cleaner to do it with the new quarter starting. Stephen Scouten Yep. No, that makes perfect sense. And then I know you guys were commenting on higher payoffs within your stand-alone portfolio. Are you -- has Sandy Spring, to your knowledge, experienced some of the same dynamics? And do you have any updated commentary on what that could potentially do for the potential needed size of the CRE loan sale? John Asbury I won't comment on Sandy Spring. We can't speak for them. So you'll have to ask them. We presume they will release soon -- next week. We'll let them speak to exactly when that will be. But I will say across the industry, we predicted that we would see elevated commercial real estate sales. Most of what -- probably, payoffs. Most of what that is, the majority of it is refinances into the term market. So it's kind of interesting that the developers have been waiting. And I think they've decided rates probably aren't going down much from here, and they want their capital back to go reinvest into other projects, so they're going into the term markets. And I think we're likely going to see that across the board. Our agreement is we will sell $2 billion in terms of our [better SAR] agreement, and that's what we will do. And then as I mentioned, we're seeing a rise in construction financing, which is good, three quarters in a row, we've kind of been waiting on that. Dave, do you want to -- Dave Ring is here, head of our commercial businesses. Do you want to comment on payoffs? Probably the most unusual thing we saw this quarter were elevated commercial and industrial payoffs. We especially saw that in the government contract finance business. Do you have any high-level perspective as to what's going on there? David Ring Yeah. And just -- thanks, John. Just to comment on what you just said, about 57% of our real estate payoffs were refinancings to the term market. John Asbury Versus sales, which is... David Ring Sales. Yes. Then there's a portion of them that are just line payoffs, which are not sales either. So we're seeing like a nice mix of sales refinancing line paydowns, which is very good for our portfolio, healthy, very healthy for our portfolio. The rest of the portfolio, we're seeing some payoffs that are normal, and then we're seeing payoffs from private credit enterprises that are coming in mostly against our government contracted portfolio. So that's kind of the new dynamic we're seeing in our portfolio, seeing private credit that, in our minds, looks like pseudo equity because it's not structured very well. It doesn't look like a bank deal. So we see that, and we see that as healthy, too. It's a healthy dynamic to help customers grow and take out some of the riskier loans off our portfolio. John Asbury Yes, it's first time we've really seen this in any meaningful way, and they tend to deal with sort of the larger middle market types of clients. Frequently, the avenue they used to get in is there's private equity behind a number of these companies, and that seems to be sort of the conduit for how they come in. But we saw more of that than we've seen before. So that's kind of interesting. David Ring But we are seeing kind of a rich pipeline coming back in. Real estate, steady. C&I pipeline has grown year-over-year. About 31%. John Asbury I want to elaborate on [DEFCON] for just a moment, is that there are going to be winners and losers, we think, based on what we're seeing in terms of kind of the focus of the new administration. This administration is pro defense, pro-national security, and we actually believe that the types of clients that we finance, which are not large -- we're not talking about a large global weapons systems contractors. The types of middle-market companies that deal with cybersecurity, information security, these are all areas that are going to get more investment. And so you have to pick and choose. This is sort of a niche operation for us. And I think there's a reason why you see private equity and private credit coming into these companies because they see opportunity. Stephen Scouten Yeah, for sure. Makes a lot of sense. Okay. And then maybe just last thing for me. I mean, there's a lot of moving parts here for sure, like you said, some new dynamics around payoffs. You've got Sandy Spring combination pending. You've got mid-single-digit growth as the guidance, which can be a fairly wide range. Can you give maybe some thoughts around what would cause you to be maybe at the lower end of that range and what could deliver towards the higher end of that range? And even like where you'd almost want to cap that out? I know -- you guys aren't trying to grow 10%, let's say. So just kind of how you think about those dynamics and the ranges that could come about? John Asbury Yeah. You don't want to -- I mean, a bank like us, excessive growth would not be a good scenario. That makes me wonder why are you growing excessively. Remember, we deal with -- we go head-to-head all day every single day, particularly with the big guys. And we tend to deal with quality clients. And so if we had a wider risk box, we would be doing more, but that is not us. Probably, Dave, I guess I ask you, my gut reaction would be elevated payoffs, just like we saw, we would have had much better loan growth in Q4, have we not had elevated payoffs because production was very good. David Ring Yeah. It's hard to say where you fall in the loan growth because we kind of stick to our same formula. We don't really want to compete on structure. We like the way we structure transactions. And sometimes, if a competitor is structuring something, we will -- a different way, we will let it go. And so that range that we give you really reflects how aggressive the competition is going to be versus how aggressive we are going to be. John Asbury Yeah, I would agree. And yes, there's a reason why I think for every year that I've been here, and I've been here eight years, our investor presentation always begins with the philosophy of soundness, profitability and growth. I'm an old credit officer out of Wachovia by background. That is [John Midland]. Sound bank, profitable bank, growing bank. If you do accomplish all three, that is the correct order. Bad things happen when you get things out of order. Stephen Scouten Yeah. Without a doubt, I appreciate all the color and commentary. Very helpful, guys. Operator Dave Bishop, Hovde Group. David Bishop I think John, maybe a sort of holistic question for you. As you get bigger across the lower or Mid-Atlantic here in Maryland and Virginia and North Carolina, obviously, you're already bumping up and competing against you said, sort of the three big uglies. Do you think from a deposit pricing and maybe beta perspective, you're more tied to what they do in terms of sort of moving funding cost? Or do you still have the ability to sort of relationship price, as you noted, and bring down (inaudible)? John Asbury I would like for the transcript to reflect that it was David Bishop and not John Asbury that referred to large banks as the \"big uglies.\" To answer your question, our strategy is not to try to win anything based on pricing. We have to be competitive, Dave. But we do believe that we don't have to match. To me, it's kind of sad when we find ourselves having to match like dollar for dollar or anything because you hope that clients will value the relationship. And not simply -- there are people, there's no question, there are segments that go for pricing and pricing only. I will say that across all of these markets, it's really, really important to understand that there's no one quite like us. We are the -- we are number 1 in depository market share for regional banks, which means under $100 billion in Virginia. Sandy has that position in Maryland. The price is set for deposits by these larger players. Yes, there are smaller players that can influence, particularly local markets. But I think overall, as a strategy, we tend to sort of follow the big guys. And we do the best we can to hopefully differentiate. Shawn O'Brien is head of consumer and business banking. Shawn, you probably deal with this more than anyone. What do you say? Shawn O'brien I think that there are always smaller banks that our competitors will drive up deposit pricing. But generally, we have the pricing ability to stay very close to the large banks. So I think that's fair. We may have higher pricing in some markets where we want to compete. So we don't have universal pricing everywhere. But I think, yeah, we have the ability to price very close to what those big banks are offering. John Asbury Yeah. But we don't have to beat them. And the truth of the matter is that we try to make sure that we get paid for what we deliver. Dave, are you there? Bill Cimino I think we might have gotten cut off. Michelle, we'll go to the next caller, please. And then we'll try to circle back to Dave if he can get back on the line. Operator Steve Moss, Raymond James. (technical difficulty) Steve Moss -- Redialing, the call dropped off. So I missed the last couple of commentary. Okay. So I guess maybe just with regard to purchase accounting here and the NII guide. Just curious, what's the -- how much accretion do you guys expect for 2025? Robert Gorman You mean increasing in terms of the interest income side? Steve Moss Yeah, that -- Yeah. Robert Gorman So overall, on the deal we announced which was 25% or 22% accretive. It's going to go up a bit, assuming rates stay where they are, maybe closer to between 25% and 30%. So that's what we're expecting out of the gates in terms of accretion income in terms of the impact on the net interest margin. John Asbury Just for absolute clarity, you're talking about the Sandy Spring acquisition, right? Robert Gorman Yeah. Is that what your question was? Steve Moss In terms of the -- the stand-alone guide, yeah. John Asbury Okay. So AUB stand... Robert Gorman Yeah, in terms of accretion on the margin, yes, it's going to be stable from here. It's about 20 basis points , 22 basis points on the margin, Steve, 23. Steve Moss Okay. Robert Gorman Yes. When you look at the guide, if that's what you're referring to, I'm --, I misinterpreted that question. Yes, I think about it in about 20 basis points to 22 basis points of accretion. Steve Moss Okay. Appreciate that. And then I'm not sure if this was asked and answered, but you guys are talking about market dynamics and competition with private credit, but I was just kind of thinking overall, what are you guys seeing for loan pricing these days? Obviously, moving to five years could help, but definitely hearing tighter spreads from a number of people. John Asbury Dave Ring, would you like to speak to that? David Ring Well, it's really on an individual basis. Tighter spreads happen sometimes. But most of the time, we're going to get the spread that we require within our pricing model. A lot of banks our size doesn\u2019t even utilize formal pricing models. We do. And so we're really able to monitor and adjust on the fly when we're talking about how competition reacts, and we have specific people within our group to monitor that every day. John Asbury But I would say it's a competitive environment for quality credit. I do read comments about surprisingly high yields on things and they're traditionally fixed rate loans on real estate and are things that maybe we wouldn't be willing to do. So we're not going to be sort of a -- we're not going to have the highest yield on credit because of the credit risk appetite that we have. So -- and then you're into kind of like the quality realm. And it's going to be more competitive. There's nothing new about that. Steve Moss Okay. And then in terms of the nonperformer, it sounds like it's an asset based loan with some fraud. Just kind of curious, is that a -- what's the prospect for recoveries there? Is that really a preliminary provision? Could we kind of see a higher provision for that specific credit? John Asbury I would say that the specific reserve by definition reflects, to the best of our knowledge, what to expect. Doug, do you have -- Doug Woolley is here, Chief Credit Officer. I mean, how else would you say it but that? Douglas Woolley Yeah, that's exactly the way to say it. And towards the end of the quarter. So loss unknown but anticipated using a specific reserve. It was known, it would have been a charge-off. So we're working through the process right now. John Asbury Yeah, there's a methodology behind the number that we came up with. We believe that is the appropriate reserve based on everything we know at this time, and that's about all we can say. Steve Moss Okay. Got it. And then in terms of the Sandy Spring transaction here, rates having backed up a bit, I think, John, you alluded to, you fully expect to sell the entire $2 billion of CRE you mentioned before. And therefore, I assume just given where rates are, you guys are also likely take the entire equity raise down as it stands these days? Robert Gorman Yeah, that's right, Steve. We fully expect to take the entire forward issue all of the shares related to that forward. John Asbury The good news is we continue to hear from Morgan Stanley, who is at work on this now. Who will actually conduct the commercial real estate portfolio to these markets are liquid. Demand is high. They are pleased with the marks, I guess, you would say that they're seeing as they're conducting other real estate sales. So we feel good about -- I guess I would say, Rob, we would stand by all of our original assumptions on the CRE sale. Robert Gorman Yeah. At the moment, we would do that. Even though rates backed up a bit, we still feel -- we had estimated about [$0.90] on the dollar related to those -- that $2 billion portfolio sale. We still feel pretty good about that, rates backed up a bit. John Asbury Faster bracing also means less uncertainty. That portfolio sale will happen faster than we would have thought because we weren't expecting to be in a position to close when we hope to close. Steve Moss Right, 100%. Okay. Great. Really appreciate all the color. Bill Cimino And operator, let's try to get Dave Bishop back if we can. Operator Dave Bishop, Hovde Group. David Bishop Have you heard -- can you hear me? John Asbury There you are. We're glad you're back. David Bishop I don't know if you're -- my question before I get cut off. I'm not sure what happened out there in ether. My question, I guess, from a big picture perspective as you get bigger and you compete with the large three big uglies, do you think your deposit beta more mirrors them to be more captive what they're doing in the market from a pricing perspective? Or you can still sort of retain that flexibility to sort of one-off like relationship? John Asbury Thank you. We gave you a long-winded answer to your question, but you couldn't hear it, so you can read that in the transcript. I guess the summary version is that there's no question that pricing is set by the larger players broadly in these markets. Individual sort of submarkets are influenced by smaller banks, but we think of the price makers as being the large players. Having said that, our strategy, we don't do anything where we try to win anything, deposits, lending anything else just based on a pure we're the cheapest strategy or pay the most on deposits. So we always try to be able to gain a premium. So we -- I will say that as a general strategy, yes, we sort of follow the big guys. And they kind of set the price, and we try to do better. Your key point is it's a relationship. It's negotiated based on relationship wherever possible. Is that a fair summary? David Bishop Okay. Great. Yeah, I'll have to read the transcript to get the blow by blow, but I appreciate that. And then I guess one final question and maybe you alluded to it in Steve's question. But as it relates to read the press headlines in terms of what Trump wants to do in DC. with all the buildings, I know the FBI is already moving out and such, and they're pretty old. But do you get the sense there's a decent amount of capital from -- I know you've been shying away from CRE out there, but you get the sense that there's a decent amount of sponsors and developers that would like to get their hands on these properties and maybe redevelopment into multifamily housing? Just curious, what do you think that aspect. John Asbury With the right incentives, it will be interesting to hear. You can, of course, ask that. The Sandy leadership will be joining us is going to have a very specific view, but I'm pretty familiar. I would tell you that you have to ask yourself if it's true that the US government wants to liquidate a lot of these old large properties that are typically B grade or C grade that need capital improvement, that are underutilized, what becomes with them. The likelihood of them being converted into like Class A plus office space -- and my personal opinion is low. There's a scarcity of housing. There is a serious problem with housing across all of these markets, a shortage. The highest and best use could potentially be conversion into multifamily. That is expensive. I don't think that could realistically happen in the absence of some sort of incentive program like tax credits. So personally, I look at this, and I say to myself, there's a significant opportunity here if this is going to happen if the right investment and incentives are provided to attract capital to provide more housing. But I don't know what that looks like exactly. I think that in terms of like the impact on us, as I've been clear on whether it's Sandy Spring or AUB in our opinion, it's sort of irrelevant if you see more old large office buildings going on in the market. That doesn't impact us because we don't fancy large office buildings, nor does Sandy. And they have not much exposure in DC anyway on non-other occupied, and we have zero currently. So I frankly see opportunity. I just hope that whoever the powers that be look at this and ask, like what becomes of this? Is there an opportunity, but I think there'll have to be incentives in some way, shape or form, and we'll see what happens. Dave, you live in the area. I know you sit right in the heart of Sandy Springs franchise. You know this market very well. How do you think about things? David Ring Yeah. I mean I totally agree in terms of the affordability of housing down there. I mean, like you hit it on the head, it's a very well-educated, a fluid market, a lot of moving parts to it. But the mayor is trying to clean up the city here as much as she can. I think she's doing a pretty decent job here. But you see some of the numbers floating around. It's a fire sale price of 20% to 30%, maybe that's enough to -- not of a discount to really sort of make the IRR hurdles in terms of the rehab indeed to raise ceiling heights and floor heights and such to get that -- to get sort of a floor clearing price to get those properties moved pretty nicely. John Asbury I agree. At the right basis, things can work, and that may in and of itself be one of the incentives that the government is willing to put it in the right hands at a price that makes it works. Perhaps that could help, too. So I do think that, again, the administration has been clear, they're committed to a clean vibrant and safe Washington, D.C. So it's -- we'll see what becomes of all of this. I wish them much success in terms of improving government efficiency and reducing regulation, that will be good for everyone, way beyond the Greater Washington region. Bill Cimino Thank you, Dave, and thanks, everyone, for calling today. We apologize for the technical difficulties, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Have a good day. Operator This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Union Bankshares Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year Financial Results Business Wire Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 2:45 PM 25 min read In This Article: AUB AUB-PA RICHMOND, Va., January 23, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Atlantic Union Bankshares Corporation (the \"Company\" or \"Atlantic Union\") (NYSE: AUB) reported net income available to common shareholders of $54.8 million and basic and diluted earnings per common share of $0.61 and $0.60, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2024 and adjusted operating earnings available to common shareholders (1) of $61.4 million and adjusted diluted operating earnings per common share (1) of $0.67 for the fourth quarter of 2024. Net income available to common shareholders was $197.3 million and basic and diluted earnings per common share were $2.29 and $2.24, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024. Adjusted operating earnings available to common shareholders (1) were $241.3 million and adjusted diluted operating earnings per common share (1) were $2.74 for the year ended December 31, 2024. \" 2024 was a good year, and a consequential year, for Atlantic Union,\" said John C. Asbury, president and chief executive officer of Atlantic Union. \" We were excited to close our acquisition of American National Bankshares Inc. on April 1st and we announced the proposed acquisition of Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc. on October 21st. We were pleased to have received merger approvals from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond seven weeks after filing the merger applications. Atlantic Union is a story of transformation from a Virginia community bank to the largest regional bank headquartered in Virginia, with operations in North Carolina and Maryland, to what will be the largest regional bank headquartered in the lower Mid-Atlantic upon closing our proposed acquisition of Sandy Spring. \"While our results for the fourth quarter were noisy with merger-related costs and a larger than typical specific reserve on an impaired loan, we delivered solid adjusted operating financial results for the year and the fourth quarter. We continue to be on a steady loan and deposit growth path. \"Operating under the mantra of soundness, profitability, and growth \u2013 in that order of priority \u2013 Atlantic Union remains committed to generating sustainable, profitable growth, and building long-term value for our shareholders.\" NET INTEREST INCOME For the fourth quarter of 2024, net interest income was $183.2 million, an increase of $316,000 from $182.9 million in the third quarter of 2024. Net interest income - fully taxable equivalent (\"FTE\") (1) was $187.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, an increase of $208,000 from $186.8 million in the third quarter of 2024. The increases from the prior quarter in both net interest income and net interest income (FTE) (1) reflect the impacts of a decrease in interest expense due to lower short-term borrowing costs resulting from a $312.2 million decrease in average borrowings, lower deposit costs, as the Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates, resulting in a 100 basis points decrease in the Federal Funds rate since September 2024, as well as an increase in interest income from other earning assets as a result of a $402.0 million increase in average cash and other earning asset balances, partially offset by a decrease in interest income on loans held for investment (\"LHFI\"), due to lower loan yields, primarily driven by the impact of the interest rate cuts on our variable rate loans. For the fourth quarter of 2024, both the Company\u2019s net interest margin and the net interest margin (FTE) (1) decreased 5 basis points compared to the prior quarter to 3.26% and 3.33%, respectively, due to lower yields on earning assets primarily driven by the decreases in variable rate loan yields, partially offset by a reduction in the cost of funds and an increase in yields on cash and other earning assets. Earning asset yields for the fourth quarter of 2024 decreased 20 basis points to 5.74% compared to the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to lower yields on loans. Cost of funds decreased from the prior quarter by 15 basis points to 2.41% for the fourth quarter of 2024, reflecting lower borrowing and deposit costs. Story Continues The Company\u2019s net interest margin (FTE) (1) includes the impact of acquisition accounting fair value adjustments. Net accretion income related to acquisition accounting was $12.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2024. The impact of accretion and amortization for the periods presented are reflected in the following table (dollars in thousands): Loan Deposit Borrowings Accretion Amortization Amortization Total For the quarter ended September 30, 2024 $ 13,926 $ (913 ) $ (288 ) $ 12,725 For the quarter ended December 31, 2024 13,668 (775 ) (288 ) 12,605 ASSET QUALITY Overview At December 31, 2024, nonperforming assets (\"NPAs\") as a percentage of total LHFI was 0.32%, an increase of 12 basis points from the prior quarter and included nonaccrual loans of $58.0 million. The increase in NPAs was primarily due to one new nonaccrual loan within the commercial and industrial portfolio of $27.7 million, for which the Company recorded a specific reserve of $13.1 million. Accruing past due loans as a percentage of total LHFI totaled 31 basis points at December 31, 2024, an increase of 1 basis point from September 30, 2024, and consistent with December 31, 2023. Net charge-offs were 0.03% of total average LHFI (annualized) for the fourth quarter of 2024, an increase of 2 basis points from September 30, 2024, and consistent with December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses (\"ACL\") totaled $193.7 million at December 31, 2024, a $16.1 million increase from the prior quarter, primarily impacted by the aforementioned commercial and industrial loan with the $13.1 million specific reserve added in the current quarter. Nonperforming Assets At December 31, 2024, NPAs totaled $58.4 million, compared to $37.3 million in the prior quarter. The following table shows a summary of NPA balances at the quarters ended (dollars in thousands): December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, 2024 2024 2024 2024 2023 Nonaccrual loans $ 57,969 $ 36,847 $ 35,913 $ 36,389 $ 36,860 Foreclosed properties 404 404 230 29 29 Total nonperforming assets $ 58,373 $ 37,251 $ 36,143 $ 36,418 $ 36,889 The following table shows the activity in nonaccrual loans for the quarters ended (dollars in thousands): December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, 2024 2024 2024 2024 2023 Beginning Balance $ 36,847 $ 35,913 $ 36,389 $ 36,860 $ 28,626 Net customer payments (11,491 ) (2,219 ) (6,293 ) (1,583 ) (2,198 ) Additions 34,446 5,347 6,831 5,047 10,604 Charge-offs (1,231 ) (542 ) (759 ) (3,935 ) (172 ) Loans returning to accruing status (602 ) (1,478 ) (54 ) \u2014 \u2014 Transfers to foreclosed property \u2014 (174 ) (201 ) \u2014 \u2014 Ending Balance $ 57,969 $ 36,847 $ 35,913 $ 36,389 $ 36,860 Past Due Loans At December 31, 2024, past due loans still accruing interest totaled $57.7 million or 0.31% of total LHFI, compared to $55.2 million or 0.30% of total LHFI at September 30, 2024, and $48.4 million or 0.31% of total LHFI at December 31, 2023. The increase in past due loan levels at December 31, 2024 from September 30, 2024 was primarily within the commercial and industrial and residential 1-4 family \u2013 consumer portfolios. Of the total past due loans still accruing interest, $14.1 million or 0.08% of total LHFI were past due 90 days or more at December 31, 2024, compared to $15.2 million or 0.08% of total LHFI at September 30, 2024, and $13.9 million or 0.09% of total LHFI at December 31, 2023. Allowance for Credit Losses At December 31, 2024, the ACL was $193.7 million and included an allowance for loan and lease losses (\"ALLL\") of $178.6 million and a reserve for unfunded commitments (\"RUC\") of $15.0 million. The ACL at December 31, 2024 increased $16.1 million from September 30, 2024, primarily due to the $13.1 million new specific reserve on the impaired loan in the commercial and industrial portfolio discussed above, the impact of continued uncertainty in the economic outlook on certain portfolios and organic loan growth. The RUC at December 31, 2024 decreased $1.9 million from September 30, 2024, primarily due to a decrease in unfunded commitments. The ACL as a percentage of total LHFI was 1.05% at December 31, 2024, compared to 0.97% at September 30, 2024. The ALLL as a percentage of total LHFI was 0.97% at December 31, 2024, compared to 0.88% at September 30, 2024. Net Charge-offs Net charge-offs were $1.4 million or 0.03% of total average LHFI on an annualized basis for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $0.7 million or 0.01% (annualized) for the third quarter of 2024, and $1.2 million or 0.03% (annualized) for the fourth quarter of 2023. Provision for Credit Losses For the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $17.5 million, compared to $2.6 million in the prior quarter, and $8.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase in the provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter of 2024 is primarily driven by the $13.1 million specific reserve on the impaired loan in the commercial and industrial portfolio. NONINTEREST INCOME Noninterest income increased $941,000 to $35.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 from $34.3 million in the prior quarter, primarily driven by a $3.6 million increase in loan-related interest rate swap fees due to an increase in transaction volumes, partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in bank owned life insurance income primarily driven by death benefits received in the prior quarter, and a $770,000 decrease in other operating income primarily due to a decrease in equity method investment income. NONINTEREST EXPENSE Noninterest expense increased $7.1 million to $129.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 from $122.6 million in the prior quarter, primarily driven by a $5.6 million increase in pre-tax merger-related costs associated with the pending Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc. (\"Sandy Spring\") acquisition. Adjusted operating noninterest expense, (1) which excludes merger-related costs ($7.0 million in the fourth quarter and $1.4 million in the third quarter) and amortization of intangible assets ($5.6 million in the fourth quarter and $5.8 million in the third quarter), increased $1.6 million to $117.0 million for the fourth quarter from $115.4 million in the prior quarter, primarily driven by a $1.8 million increase in salaries and benefits expense primarily due to increases in variable incentive compensation expense and self-insured related group insurance costs, as well as a $1.4 million increase in professional services fees related to projects that occurred during the fourth quarter. These increases were partially offset by a $1.7 million decrease in franchise and other taxes. INCOME TAXES The Company\u2019s effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was 19.0% and 14.9%, respectively, and the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was 19.5% and 15.9%. respectively. The increase in effective tax rate for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 was primarily driven by the proportionality of tax exempt income to pre-tax income. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to a valuation allowance for certain state net operating loss carryforwards established during the second quarter of 2024, which resulted in a 170 basis points increase in the year to date effective tax rate, and the proportionality of tax exempt income to pre-tax income. BALANCE SHEET At December 31, 2024, total assets were $24.6 billion, a decrease of $218.4 million or approximately 3.5% (annualized) from September 30, 2024 and an increase of $3.4 billion or approximately 16.2% from December 31, 2023. Total assets decreased from the prior quarter primarily due to a decrease in the investment securities portfolio due to principal paydowns and a decrease in the market value of the available for sale (\"AFS\") securities portfolio, as well as a decrease in cash and cash equivalents due to greater funding needs combined with increases in individual deposits in the prior quarter. The increase in total assets from the prior year was primarily due to the American National Bankshares Inc. (\"American National\") acquisition, as well as LHFI growth. The Company\u2019s recorded preliminary goodwill related to the American National acquisition totaling $288.8 million at December 31, 2024, a $1.3 million increase from preliminary goodwill of $287.5 million at September 30, 2024. This increase was due to an adjustment to the purchase price allocation for certain provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. The measurement period adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024 related to franchise tax accruals. At December 31, 2024, LHFI totaled $18.5 billion, an increase of $133.3 million or 2.9% (annualized) from September 30, 2024, and an increase of $2.8 billion or 18.1% from December 31, 2023. Quarterly average LHFI totaled $18.4 billion at December 31, 2024, an increase of $47.5 million or 1.0% (annualized) from the prior quarter, and an increase of $3.0 billion or 19.3% from December 31, 2023. LHFI increased from the prior quarter primarily due to increases in the construction and land development loan portfolio, as well as increases in the commercial and industrial loan portfolios, partially offset by decreases in the multifamily real estate loan portfolio. The increase from the prior year was primarily due to the American National acquisition. At December 31, 2024, total investments were $3.3 billion, a decrease of $184.2 million or 20.7% (annualized) from September 30, 2024, and an increase of $164.9 million or 5.2% from December 31, 2023. The decrease compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to paydown activity and a decrease in the market value of the AFS securities portfolio, and the increase compared to the prior year was primarily due to the American National acquisition. AFS securities totaled $2.4 billion at December 31, 2024, $2.6 billion at September 30, 2024, and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2023. Total net unrealized losses on the AFS securities portfolio were $402.6 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $334.5 million at September 30, 2024, and $384.3 million at December 31, 2023. Held to maturity securities are carried at cost and totaled $803.9 million at December 31, 2024, $807.1 million at September 30, 2024, and $837.4 million at December 31, 2023 and had net unrealized losses of $44.5 million at December 31, 2024, $30.3 million at September 30, 2024, and $29.3 million at December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2024, total deposits were $20.4 billion, an increase of $92.3 million or 1.8% (annualized) from the prior quarter. Average deposits at December 31, 2024 increased $583.4 million or 11.5% (annualized) from the prior quarter. Both total deposits and average deposits at December 31, 2024 increased $3.6 billion or 21.3% from December 31, 2023. The increase in deposit balances from the prior quarter was primarily due to an increase of $438.6 million in interest bearing customer deposits, partially offset by decreases in demand deposits and brokered deposits of $145.9 million and $200.4 million, respectively. The increase from the prior year was primarily related to the addition of the American National acquired deposits, as well as an increase of $669.5 million in brokered deposits. At December 31, 2024, total borrowings were $534.6 million, a decrease of $317.6 million from September 30, 2024 and a decrease of $777.3 million from December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2024 average borrowings were $543.1 million, a decrease of $312.2 million from September 30, 2024, and a decrease of $249.6 million from December 31, 2023. The decreases in average borrowings from the prior quarter and the prior year were primarily due to repayment of short-term FHLB advances using funds from customer deposit growth.

LLC; changes in the Company\u2019s or Sandy Spring\u2019s share price before closing; the impact of purchase accounting with respect to the American National acquisition, or any change in the assumptions used regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to determine the fair value and credit marks; the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger with Sandy Spring or the American National acquisition, including anticipated cost savings and strategic gains, are not realized when expected or at all, including as a result of the impact of, or problems arising from, the integration of the companies or as a result of the strength of the economy, competitive factors in the areas where we do business, or as a result of other unexpected factors or events; potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships, including those resulting from the announcement or completion of the proposed merger with Sandy Spring or the American National acquisition; monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. government, including policies of the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve; the quality or composition of our loan or investment portfolios and changes therein; demand for loan products and financial services in our market areas; our ability to manage our growth or implement our growth strategy; the effectiveness of expense reduction plans; the introduction of new lines of business or new products and services; our ability to identify, recruit, and retain key employees; real estate values in our lending area; changes in accounting principles, standards, rules, and interpretations, and the related impact on our financial statements; an insufficient ACL or volatility in the ACL resulting from the CECL methodology, either alone or as that may be affected by changing economic conditions, credit concentrations, inflation, changing interest rates, or other factors; concentrations of loans secured by real estate, particularly CRE; the effectiveness of our credit processes and management of our credit risk; our ability to compete in the market for financial services and increased competition from fintech companies; technological risks and developments, and cyber threats, attacks, or events; operational, technological, cultural, regulatory, legal, credit, and other risks associated with the exploration, consummation and integration of potential future acquisitions, whether involving stock or cash consideration; the potential adverse effects of unusual and infrequently occurring events, such as weather-related disasters, terrorist acts, geopolitical conflicts or public health events (such as pandemics), and of governmental and societal responses thereto; these potential adverse effects may include, without limitation, adverse effects on the ability of our borrowers to satisfy their obligations to us, on the value of collateral securing loans, on the demand for our loans or our other products and services, on supply chains and methods used to distribute products and services, on incidents of cyberattack and fraud, on our liquidity or capital positions, on risks posed by reliance on third-party service providers, on other aspects of our business operations and on financial markets and economic growth; performance by our counterparties or vendors; deposit flows; the availability of financing and the terms thereof; the level of prepayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities; the effects of legislative or regulatory changes and requirements, including changes in federal, state or local tax laws; actual or potential claims, damages, and fines related to litigation or government actions, which may result in, among other things, additional costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business activities, reputational harm, or other adverse consequences; any event or development that would cause us to conclude that there was an impairment of any asset, including intangible assets, such as goodwill; and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.

________________________________________ (1) These are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes net interest income (FTE), total revenue (FTE), and total adjusted revenue (FTE), which are used in computing net interest margin (FTE), efficiency ratio (FTE) and adjusted operating efficiency ratio (FTE), provide valuable additional insight into the net interest margin and the efficiency ratio by adjusting for differences in tax treatment of interest income sources. The entire FTE adjustment is attributable to interest income on earning assets, which is used in computing the yield on earning assets. Interest expense and the related cost of interest-bearing liabilities and cost of funds ratios are not affected by the FTE components. (2) These are non-GAAP financial measures. Tangible assets and tangible common equity are used in the calculation of certain profitability, capital, and per share ratios. The Company believes tangible assets, tangible common equity and the related ratios are meaningful measures of capital adequacy because they provide a meaningful base for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons, which the Company believes will assist investors in assessing the capital of the Company and its ability to absorb potential losses. The Company believes tangible common equity is an important indication of its ability to grow organically and through business combinations as well as its ability to pay dividends and to engage in various capital management strategies. (3) These are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that ROTCE is a meaningful supplement to GAAP financial measures and is useful to investors because it measures the performance of a business consistently across time without regard to whether components of the business were acquired or developed internally. (4) These are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted operating measures exclude, as applicable, merger-related costs, strategic cost saving initiatives (principally composed of severance charges related to headcount reductions and charges for exiting leases), FDIC special assessments, legal reserves associated with our previously disclosed settlement with the CFPB, deferred tax asset write-down, gain (loss) on sale of securities, and gain on sale-leaseback transaction. The Company believes these non-GAAP adjusted measures provide investors with important information about the continuing economic results of the Company\u2019s operations. (5) All ratios at December 31, 2024 are estimates and subject to change pending the Company\u2019s filing of its FR Y9 C. All other periods are presented as filed. (6) The adjusted operating efficiency ratio (FTE) excludes, as applicable, the amortization of intangible assets, merger-related costs, FDIC special assessments, strategic cost saving initiatives (principally composed of severance charges related to headcount reductions and charges for exiting leases), legal reserves associated with our previously disclosed settlement with the CFPB, gain (loss) on sale of securities, and gain on sale-leaseback transaction. This measure is similar to the measure used by the Company when analyzing corporate performance and is also similar to the measure used for incentive compensation. The Company believes this adjusted measure provides investors with important information about the continuing economic results of the Company\u2019s operations. (7) These are non-GAAP financial measures. Pre-tax pre-provision adjusted earnings excludes, as applicable, the provision for credit losses, which can fluctuate significantly from period-to-period under the CECL methodology, income tax expense, merger-related costs, strategic cost saving initiatives (principally composed of severance charges related to headcount reductions and charges for exiting leases), FDIC special assessments, legal reserves associated with our previously disclosed settlement with the CFPB, gain (loss) on sale of securities, and gain on sale-leaseback transaction. The Company believes this adjusted measure provides investors with important information about the continuing economic results of the Company\u2019s operations. (8) The calculations exclude the impact of unvested restricted stock awards outstanding as of each period end.
