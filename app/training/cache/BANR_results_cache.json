[{"text": "What Makes Banner (BANR) a Strong Momentum Stock: Buy Now? Zacks Equity Research Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 8:00 PM 4 min read In This Article: BANR -1.70% Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades. Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us. Below, we take a look at Banner (BANR) , a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score. It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Banner currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.

In order to see if BANR is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this regional bank holds up. A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area. For BANR, shares are up 7.86% over the past week while the Zacks Financial - Savings and Loan industry is up 3.05% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 3.96% compares favorably with the industry's 0.11% performance as well. Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Banner have risen 7.1%, and are up 44.12% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 5.33% and 26.85%, respectively. Investors should also pay attention to BANR's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. BANR is currently averaging 203,861 shares for the last 20 days. Story Continues Earnings Outlook The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with BANR. Over the past two months, 3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost BANR's consensus estimate, increasing from $4.87 to $5.06 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period. Bottom Line Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that BANR is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Banner on your short list. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

{"text": "Banner (NASDAQ:BANR) Is Paying Out A Dividend Of $0.48 editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sun, Jan 26, 2025, 3:01 PM 3 min read In This Article: BANR -1.70% The board of Banner Corporation ( NASDAQ:BANR ) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 14th of February, with investors receiving $0.48 per share. Based on this payment, the dividend yield will be 2.8%, which is fairly typical for the industry. View our latest analysis for Banner Banner's Payment Expected To Have Solid Earnings Coverage We like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. Banner has established itself as a dividend paying company with over 10 years history of distributing earnings to shareholders. Based on Banner's last earnings report, the payout ratio is at a decent 39%, meaning that the company is able to pay out its dividend with a bit of room to spare. The next 3 years are set to see EPS grow by 22.2%. Analysts forecast the future payout ratio could be 36% over the same time horizon, which is a number we think the company can maintain. NasdaqGS:BANR Historic Dividend January 26th 2025 Dividend Volatility Although the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2015, the annual payment back then was $0.72, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.92. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 10% over that duration. Banner has grown distributions at a rapid rate despite cutting the dividend at least once in the past. Companies that cut once often cut again, so we would be cautious about buying this stock solely for the dividend income. The Dividend's Growth Prospects Are Limited With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. Earnings have grown at around 3.2% a year for the past five years, which isn't massive but still better than seeing them shrink. Earnings growth is slow, but on the plus side, the dividend payout ratio is low and dividends could grow faster than earnings, if the company decides to increase its payout ratio. In Summary Overall, a consistent dividend is a good thing, and we think that Banner has the ability to continue this into the future. The dividend has been at reasonable levels historically, but that hasn't translated into a consistent payment. This looks like it could be a good dividend stock going forward, but we would note that the payout ratio has been at higher levels in the past so it could happen again. Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

Positive Points Banner Corp ( NASDAQ:BANR ) reported a net profit of $46.4 million or $1.34 per diluted share for Q4 2024, an increase from $1.24 per share in Q4 2023. The company maintained a strong core deposit base, with core deposits representing 89% of total deposits. Banner Corp's core earnings for the full year 2024 were $223.2 million, showcasing strong operational performance. The company was recognized by Forbes and Newsweek as one of America's 100 best banks and one of the most trustworthy companies. Banner Corp's liquidity and capital profile remain robust, with all capital ratios exceeding regulatory well-capitalized levels. Negative Points Delinquent loans increased to 0.49%, up 9 basis points compared to the previous quarter and year-end 2023. Adversely classified loans rose by $42 million, now totaling 1.69% of total loans. Loan originations declined moderately due to reduced consumer demand and muted construction and development loan closings. Non-interest expense increased by $3.2 million from the prior quarter, reflecting higher professional fees and marketing expenses. The agricultural loan portfolio faced challenges due to lower commodity prices, impacting smaller borrowers. Story Continues Q & A Highlights Q : Were there any recoveries in the quarter that helped the margin? A : Robert Butterfield, CFO: There were no unusual recoveries. The margin benefited from a decline in funding costs, particularly due to a decrease in deposit costs and a balance sheet hedge that rolled off, adding four basis points to the margin. Q : How do you view the margin for 2025, especially if rate cuts occur? A : Robert Butterfield, CFO: In Q1, margins are expected to be flat due to loan yields decreasing slightly. However, deposit costs may decline, and wholesale borrowing might increase. For the rest of the year, margins could be flat to down following rate cuts, but without cuts, margins might increase slightly each quarter. Q : Is there an opportunity in the mortgage business given market exits by competitors? A : Mark Grescovich, CEO: Mortgage banking has been a strength for Banner for 134 years. We see opportunities due to market disruptions and believe our core competency will allow us to capitalize on these changes, provided interest rates cooperate. Q : What is the outlook for loan growth in 2025? A : Jill Rice, Chief Credit Officer: We are targeting mid-single-digit growth rates for 2025. Our commercial pipelines are healthy, but potential economic factors like interest rates and tariffs could impact growth. Q : How are you managing deposit costs, and have you seen any client attrition? A : Robert Butterfield, CFO: Conversations with clients, especially larger business clients, have been positive. We remain competitive in interest rates, and there has been no significant client attrition. Mark Grescovich, CEO, added that the number of accounts increased, indicating client retention despite rate reductions.

Q4 Earnings and Revenue Estimates Zacks Equity Research Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 1:10 AM 3 min read In This Article: BANR -1.70% HMST -0.50% Banner (BANR) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.33 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.22 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.34 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 9.02%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this regional bank would post earnings of $1.18 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.30, delivering a surprise of 10.17%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times. Banner , which belongs to the Zacks Financial - Savings and Loan industry, posted revenues of $160.57 million for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.60%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $152.46 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Banner shares have added about 5.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.9%. What's Next for Banner? While Banner has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Banner: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

of $46.4 Million, or $1.34 Per Diluted Share, for Fourth Quarter 2024; Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.48 Per Share Business Wire Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 12:00 AM 22 min read In This Article: BANR -1.70% WALLA WALLA, Wash., January 22, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Banner Corporation (NASDAQ:BANR) (\"Banner\"), the parent company of Banner Bank, today reported net income of $46.4 million, or $1.34 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $45.2 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, for the preceding quarter and $42.6 million, or $1.24 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2023. Net interest income was $140.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $135.7 million in the preceding quarter and $138.4 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. The increase in net interest income compared to the preceding quarter reflects a decrease in funding costs and an increase in interest-earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in yields on interest earning assets. The increase in net interest income compared to the prior year quarter reflects an increase in both the yield and average balance of interest earning assets, partially offset by an increase in funding costs. Fourth quarter 2024 results included a $3.0 million provision for credit losses, up from $1.7 million in the preceding quarter and $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Net income was $168.9 million, or $4.88 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $183.6 million, or $5.33 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2023. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased to $541.7 million from $576.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to the rise of deposit costs of $99.3 million, partially offset by a $77.7 million increase in interest income on loans. Results for the year ended December 31, 2024 included a $7.6 million provision for credit losses, a $5.2 million net loss on the sale of securities and a $1.0 million net decrease in the valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value, compared to a $10.8 million provision for credit losses, a $19.2 million net loss on the sale of securities and a $4.2 million net decrease in the valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value during the same period in 2023. Banner announced that its Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.48 per share payable February 14, 2025, to common shareholders of record on February 4, 2025. \"Banner\u2019s fourth quarter financial performance reflects the continued successful execution of our super community bank strategy, which emphasizes growing new client relationships, maintaining our core funding position, promoting client loyalty and advocacy through our responsive service model, and sustaining a moderate risk profile,\" said Mark Grescovich, President and CEO. \"Our earnings for the fourth quarter of 2024 benefited from our solid year over year loan growth as well as margin expansion during the fourth quarter as a result of lower funding costs. This benefit was partially offset by the declining interest rate environment and its effect on loan yields. Additionally, Banner\u2019s credit metrics continue to be strong, our reserve for loan losses remained solid, and our capital base continues to be robust. We continue to benefit from a strong core deposit base that has been resilient in a highly competitive environment, with core deposits representing 89% of total deposits at quarter end. Banner has upheld its core values for the past 134 years, which are to do the right thing for our clients, communities, colleagues, company and shareholders; and to provide consistent and reliable strength through all economic cycles and change events.\" Story Continues At December 31, 2024, Banner, on a consolidated basis, had $16.20 billion in assets, $11.20 billion in net loans and $13.51 billion in deposits. Banner operates 135 full-service branch offices, including branches located in eight of the top 20 largest western Metropolitan Statistical Areas by population. Fourth Quarter 2024 Highlights Revenue was $160.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $153.7 million in the preceding quarter and $152.5 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. Adjusted revenue* (the total of net interest income and total non-interest income adjusted for the net gain or loss on the sale of securities and the net change in valuation of financial instruments) was $160.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $153.7 million in the preceding quarter and $157.1 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. Net interest income was $140.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $135.7 million in the preceding quarter and $138.4 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. Net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, was 3.82%, compared to 3.72% in the preceding quarter and 3.83% in the fourth quarter a year ago. Mortgage banking operations revenue was $3.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $3.2 million in the preceding quarter and $5.4 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. Return on average assets was 1.15%, compared to 1.13% in the preceding quarter and 1.09% in the fourth quarter a year ago. Net loans receivable increased 1% to $11.20 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to $11.07 billion at September 30, 2024, and increased 5% compared to $10.66 billion at December 31, 2023. Non-performing assets were $39.6 million, or 0.24% of total assets, at December 31, 2024, compared to $45.2 million, or 0.28% of total assets, at September 30, 2024 and $30.1 million, or 0.19% of total assets, at December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses - loans was $155.5 million, or 1.37% of total loans receivable, as of December 31, 2024, compared to $154.6 million, or 1.38% of total loans receivable, as of September 30, 2024 and $149.6 million, or 1.38% of total loans receivable, as of December 31, 2023.

Income Statement Review Net interest income was $140.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $135.7 million in the preceding quarter and $138.4 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. Net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis increased ten basis points to 3.82% for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to 3.72% in the preceding quarter, and decreased compared to 3.83% in the fourth quarter a year ago. Net interest margin for the current quarter, compared to the preceding quarter, benefited from decreased funding costs, partially offset by lower yields on interest earning assets, primarily due to decreases in the targeted federal funds rate in the third and fourth quarters of 2024. Average yields on interest-earning assets decreased two basis points to 5.31% for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to 5.33% for the preceding quarter, and increased compared to 5.06% in the fourth quarter a year ago. On September 18, 2024, the Federal Open Market Committee (\"FOMC\") of the Federal Reserve System lowered the target range for the federal funds rate 50 basis points, followed by a 25 basis-point decrease on November 7, 2024 and another 25 basis-point decrease on December 18, 2024, resulting in a target range of 4.25% to 4.50% at December 31, 2024. Average loan yields decreased two basis points to 6.02%, compared to 6.04% in the preceding quarter, and increased compared to 5.77% in the fourth quarter a year ago. The decrease in average loan yields during the current quarter primarily reflects the decrease in interest rates, partially offset by the benefits of a balance sheet hedge that matured during the quarter. Total deposit costs decreased eight basis points to 1.53% in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to 1.61% in the preceding quarter, and increased compared to 1.18% in the fourth quarter a year ago. The decrease in deposit costs in the current quarter was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates, partially offset by an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits. The average rate paid on borrowings decreased 51 basis points to 4.57% in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to 5.08% in the preceding quarter, and decreased compared to 4.77% in the fourth quarter a year ago due to lower wholesale borrowings in the current quarter. The total cost of funding liabilities decreased 13 basis points to 1.60% in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to 1.73% in the preceding quarter, and increased compared to 1.31% in the fourth quarter a year ago. A $3.0 million provision for credit losses was recorded in the current quarter (comprised of a $3.2 million provision for credit losses - loans, a $203,000 recapture of provision for credit losses - unfunded loan commitments and a $16,000 recapture of provision for credit losses - held-to-maturity debt securities). This compares to a $1.7 million provision for credit losses in the prior quarter (comprised of a $2.0 million provision for credit losses - loans, a $262,000 recapture of provision for credit losses - unfunded loan commitments and a $13,000 recapture of provision for credit losses - held-to-maturity debt securities) and a $2.5 million provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter a year ago (comprised of a $3.8 million provision for credit losses - loans, a $526,000 recapture of provision for credit losses - unfunded loan commitments, a $750,000 recapture of provision for credit losses - available for sale securities and a $23,000 recapture of provision for credit losses - held-to-maturity debt securities). The provision for credit losses for the current quarter primarily reflected risk rating downgrades as well as growth in loan balances. Total non-interest income was $20.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $18.1 million in the preceding quarter and $14.1 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. The increase in non-interest income during the current quarter compared to the preceding quarter was primarily due to a $506,000 increase in mortgage banking operations revenue and a $1.1 million increase in miscellaneous income, primarily due to a gain recognized on the sale of a non-performing loan during the fourth quarter of 2024. The increase in non-interest income during the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter was primarily due to a $5.1 million decrease in the net loss recognized on the sale of securities. Total non-interest income was $66.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $44.4 million a year earlier related mostly to the losses on the sale of investment securities in 2023. Mortgage banking operations revenue was $3.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $3.2 million in the preceding quarter and $5.4 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. While the volume of one- to four-family loans sold during the current quarter increased compared to both the preceding and prior year quarters, volumes remained low due to reduced refinancing and purchase activity in the current rate environment. The increase from the preceding quarter reflects a $508,000 gain related to the pooled loan sale of $34.8 million of one- to four-family loans during the fourth quarter of 2024. The decrease from the prior year quarter primarily reflects a $3.5 million reversal of the lower of cost or market adjustment on multifamily loans held for sale, recognized during the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by higher pricing and volumes of one- to four-family loans sold during the current quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. The reversal was due to the transfer of all remaining multifamily loans held for sale to the held for investment loan portfolio during the same period. Home purchase activity accounted for 79% of one- to four-family mortgage loan originations in the fourth quarter of 2024, 88% in the preceding quarter and 92% in the fourth quarter of 2023. Total non-interest expense was $99.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $96.3 million in the preceding quarter and $96.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase in non-interest expense for the current quarter compared to the prior quarter reflects a $691,000 increase in salary and employee benefits, primarily resulting from increased incentive accruals, partially offset by decreased medical premiums expense, a $923,000 increase in professional and legal expenses, primarily due to increased consultant expenses, and a $550,000 increase in advertising and marketing expenses, primarily due to increases in printed media marketing and community development expenses. The increase in non-interest expense for the current quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago primarily reflects increases in salary and employee benefits and professional and legal expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2024, total non-interest expense was $391.5 million, compared to $382.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Banner\u2019s efficiency ratio was 61.95% for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to 62.63% in the preceding quarter and 63.37% in the same quarter a year ago. Banner\u2019s adjusted efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, was 60.74% for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to 61.27% in the preceding quarter and 60.04% in the year ago quarter. See, \"Additional Financial Information - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" on the final two pages of this press release for a discussion and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Balance Sheet Review Total assets increased to $16.20 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to $16.19 billion at September 30, 2024, and $15.67 billion at December 31, 2023. Securities and interest-bearing deposits held at other banks totaled $3.40 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to $3.50 billion at September 30, 2024 and $3.48 billion at December 31, 2023. The decrease compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to a decrease in securities - available for sale. The average effective duration of the securities portfolio was approximately 6.6 years at December 31, 2024, compared to 6.5 years at December 31, 2023. Total loans receivable increased to $11.35 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to $11.22 billion at September 30, 2024, and $10.81 billion at December 31, 2023. Commercial real estate loans increased 2% to $3.86 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to $3.79 billion at September 30, 2024, and increased 6% compared to $3.64 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in commercial real estate loans from September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was primarily the result of new loan production and the conversion of commercial construction loans to the commercial real estate portfolio upon the completion of the construction phase. Commercial business loans increased 2% to $2.42 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to $2.37 billion at September 30, 2024 and increased 6% compared to $2.28 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily due to new loan production. One- to four-family residential loans increased 1% to $1.59 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to $1.58 billion at September 30, 2024, and increased 5% compared to $1.52 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in one- to four-family residential loans was primarily the result of one- to four-family construction loans converting to one- to four-family portfolio loans upon the completion of the construction phase and new loan production. Multifamily real estate loans increased 1% to $894.4 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $889.9 million at September 30, 2024, and increased 10% compared to $811.2 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in multifamily real estate loans from September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was primarily the result of the conversion of multifamily construction loans to the multifamily portfolio upon the completion of the construction phase. Loans held for sale were $32.0 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $78.8 million at September 30, 2024 and $11.2 million at December 31, 2023. One- to four- family residential mortgage held for sale loans sold in the current quarter totaled $153.2 million, compared to $95.0 million in the preceding quarter and $65.6 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. The decrease in loans held for sale compared to the prior quarter was primarily the result of the pooled loan sale of $34.8 million of one- to four-family residential loans during the current quarter. Total deposits were $13.51 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to $13.54 billion at September 30, 2024 and $13.03 billion a year ago. Core deposits decreased slightly to $12.01 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to $12.02 billion at September 30, 2024, and increased 4% compared to $11.55 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in core deposits compared to the prior year quarter primarily reflects increases in interest-bearing transaction and savings accounts. Core deposits were 89% of total deposits at December 31, 2024, September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Certificates of deposit decreased 1% to $1.50 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to $1.52 billion at September 30, 2024, and increased 2% compared to $1.48 billion a year earlier. The decrease in certificates of deposit during the current quarter compared to the preceding quarter was primarily the result of clients moving funds from certificates of deposits to interest-bearing transaction and savings accounts. The increase in certificates of deposit during the current quarter compared to the fourth quarter a year ago was principally due to clients seeking higher yields moving funds from core deposit accounts to higher yielding certificates of deposit, partially offset by a $57.7 million decrease in brokered deposits. FHLB advances were $290.0 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $230.0 million at September 30, 2024 and $323.0 million a year ago. At December 31, 2024, off-balance sheet liquidity included additional borrowing capacity of $2.95 billion at the FHLB and $1.52 billion at the Federal Reserve as well as federal funds line of credit agreements with other financial institutions of $125.0 million. At December 31, 2024, total common shareholders\u2019 equity was $1.77 billion or 10.95% of total assets, compared to $1.79 billion or 11.08% of total assets at September 30, 2024, and $1.65 billion or 10.55% of total assets at December 31, 2023. The decrease in total common shareholders\u2019 equity at December 31, 2024 compared to September 30, 2024 was due to an increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $51.7 million as the result of a decrease in the fair value of the security portfolio, partially offset by a $29.6 million increase in retained earnings as a result of $46.4 million in net income, partially offset by the accrual of $16.8 million of cash dividends during the fourth quarter of 2024. At December 31, 2024, tangible common shareholders\u2019 equity, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $1.40 billion, or 8.84% of tangible assets, compared to $1.42 billion, or 8.96% of tangible assets, at September 30, 2024, and $1.27 billion, or 8.33% of tangible assets, a year ago. See, \"Additional Financial Information - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" on the final two pages of this press release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Banner and Banner Bank continue to maintain capital levels in excess of the requirements to be categorized as \"well-capitalized.\" At December 31, 2024, Banner\u2019s estimated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.44%, its estimated Tier 1 leverage capital to average assets ratio was 11.05%, and its estimated total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio was 15.04%. These regulatory capital ratios are estimates, pending completion and filing of Banner\u2019s regulatory reports. Credit Quality The allowance for credit losses - loans was $155.5 million, or 1.37% of total loans receivable and 421% of non-performing loans, at December 31, 2024, compared to $154.6 million, or 1.38% of total loans receivable and 359% of non-performing loans, at September 30, 2024, and $149.6 million, or 1.38% of total loans receivable and 506% of non-performing loans, at December 31, 2023.

Net loan charge-offs totaled $2.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $230,000 in the preceding quarter and $1.1 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. Non-performing loans were $37.0 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $43.0 million at September 30, 2024, and $29.6 million a year ago.

This compares to $150.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and $125.4 million a year ago. Total non-performing assets were $39.6 million, or 0.24% of total assets, at December 31, 2024, compared to $45.2 million, or 0.28% of total assets, at September 30, 2024, and $30.1 million, or 0.19% of total assets, a year ago.

You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date such statements are made and based only on information then actually known to Banner. Banner does not undertake and specifically disclaims any obligation to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements. These statements may relate to future financial performance, strategic plans or objectives, revenues or earnings projections, or other financial information. By their nature, these statements are subject to numerous uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the statements and could negatively affect Banner\u2019s operating and stock price performance. Factors that could cause Banner\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, include but are not limited to, the following: (1) adverse impacts to economic conditions in our local market areas, other markets where the Company has lending relationships, or other aspects of the Company\u2019s business operations or financial markets, including, without limitation, as a result of employment levels, labor shortages and the effects of inflation, a recession or slowed economic growth, or increased political instability due to acts of war; (2) changes in the interest rate environment, including increases or decreases in the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the \"Federal Reserve\") benchmark rate and duration at which such interest rate levels are maintained, which could affect our revenues and expenses, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital and liquidity; (3) the impact of inflation and the current and future monetary policies of the Federal Reserve in response thereto; (4) the effects of any federal government shutdown; (5) the impact of bank failures or adverse developments at other banks and related negative press about the banking industry in general on investor and depositor sentiment; (6) expectations regarding key growth initiatives and strategic priorities; (7) the credit risks of lending activities, including changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, which could necessitate additional provisions for credit losses, resulting both from loans originated and loans acquired from other financial institutions; (8) results of examinations by regulatory authorities, including the possibility that any such regulatory authority may, among other things, require increases in the allowance for credit losses or writing down of assets or impose restrictions or penalties with respect to Banner\u2019s activities; (9) competitive pressures among depository institutions, including repricing and competitors\u2019 pricing initiatives, and their impact on Banner's market position, loan, and deposit products; (10) the effect of inflation on interest rate movements and their impact on client behavior and net interest margin; (11) fluctuations in real estate values; (12) the ability to adapt successfully to technological changes to meet clients\u2019 needs and developments in the market place; (13) the ability to access cost-effective funding; (14) disruptions, security breaches or other adverse events, failures or interruptions in, or attacks on, information technology systems or on the third-party vendors who perform critical processing functions; (15) changes in financial markets; (16) changes in economic conditions in general and in Washington, Idaho, Oregon and California in particular; (17) the costs, effects and outcomes of litigation; (18) legislation or regulatory changes, including but not limited to changes in regulatory policies and principles, or the interpretation of regulatory capital or other rules, other governmental initiatives affecting the financial services industry and changes in federal and/or state tax laws or interpretations thereof by taxing authorities; (19) the potential imposition of new tariffs or changes to existing trade policies that could affect economic activity or specific industry sectors including, but not limited to, our agriculture based lending; (20) changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines; (21) future acquisitions by Banner of other depository institutions or lines of business, and associated risks of goodwill impairment due to changes in Banner\u2019s business or market conditions; (22) effects of critical accounting policies and judgments, including the use of estimates in determining fair value of certain of our assets, which estimates may prove to be incorrect and result in significant declines in valuation; (23) environmental, social and governance goals and targets; (24) other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory, and technological factors affecting our operations, pricing, products and services; and (25) other risks detailed from time to time in Banner\u2019s other reports filed with and furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission including Banner\u2019s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Reports on Form 10-K.

ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION (dollars in thousands) * Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP), this earnings release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Tangible common shareholders\u2019 equity per share and the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, and references to adjusted revenue, adjusted earnings, the adjusted return on average assets, the adjusted return on average equity and the adjusted efficiency ratio represent non-GAAP financial measures. Management has presented these non-GAAP financial measures in this earnings release because it believes that they provide useful and comparative information to assess trends in Banner\u2019s core operations reflected in the current quarter\u2019s results and facilitate the comparison of our performance with the performance of our peers. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and are not a substitute for any analysis based on GAAP. Where applicable, comparable earnings information using GAAP financial measures is also presented. Because not all companies use the same calculations, our presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures as calculated by other companies.

I would direct your attention to pretext preprovision earnings excluding gains and losses on the sale of securities and changes in fair value of financial instruments. Our full-year 2024 core earnings were $223.2 million. Banner's fourth quarter 2024 revenue from core operations was $160 million compared to $154 million for the third quarter of 2024. For the full-year 2024, revenue from core operations was $615 million. We continue to benefit from a strong core deposit base that has proved to be resilient and loyal to Banner, a very good net interest margin and core expense control overall, this resulted in a return on average assets of 1.15% for the fourth quarter of 2024. Once again, our core performance reflects continued execution our super community bank strategy that is growing new client relationships, maintaining our core funding position, promoting client loyalty and advocacy through our responsive service model and demonstrating our safety and soundness through all economic cycles and change events. To that point, our core deposits continue to represent 89% of total deposits further. We continued our strong organic generation of new relationships and our loans increased 5% and our core deposits increased 4% over the same period last year, reflective of this solid performance, coupled with our strong regulatory capital ratios and the fact that we increased our tangible common equity per share by 9%. From the same period. Last year, we announced a core dividend of $0.48 per common share. We have published our environmental social and governance report which reflects the continued maturation of our approach to ESG Banner has always been committed to doing the right thing in support of our clients, the many communities we serve and our colleagues. The accomplishments highlighted in this report are meant to reflect the deep connection we have with all of our stakeholders and our commitment to creating positive change in the communities we serve. Finally, I'm pleased to say that we continue to receive marketplace recognition and validation of our business model. And our value proposition Banner again was named one of America's 100 best banks and one of the best banks in the world by Forbes Newsweek named Banner one of the most trustworthy companies in America in the world again this year and just recently named Banner one of the best regional banks in the country. S&P Global Market Intelligence R. Banner's financial performance among the top 50 public banks with more than $10 billion in assets. And the digital banking provider Q2 holdings awarded Banner Bank, their bank of the year for excellence. Additionally, the Kroll Bond Rating Agency affirmed all of Banner's investment-grade debt and deposit ratings. And as we've noted previously, Banner Bank received an outstanding CRA rating in our most recent CRA examination. Let me now turn the call over to Jill to discuss trends in our loan portfolio and her comments on Banner's credit quality. Jill? Story Continues Jill Rice Thank you, Mark. And good morning, everyone. Before I discuss Banner's credit metrics and loan portfolio, as of year end, I too want to acknowledge the large-scale devastation that has affected the greater Los Angeles community from the recent wildfires. Banner's exposure from the Palisades and Eaton fires is limited to roughly $1 million in HELOC commitments as of the most recent updates. However, the personal losses experienced by these clients, their family and their entire neighborhood is nothing short of heartbreaking. Recognizing that the road to recovery and rebuilding will be long and arduous, it is important to say that we will look for ways in which we can support our clients and the communities we serve in those efforts. Now turning to the loan portfolio, delinquent loans ended the quarter at 0.49%, up 9 basis points when compared to both the linked quarter and to the year ending 2023. Adversely classified loans increased $42 million in the quarter. And now total 1.69% of total loans compared to 1.34% as of the linked quarter and 1.16% as of year end 2023. It is important to note that the increase in adversely classified loans is not concentrated in any one business line or industry. And similar to the rise in delinquencies is reflective of the impact of the current economic environment has had on certain borrowers. Non-performing assets declined $6 million in the quarter and represent 0.24% of total assets consisting of $37 million in non-performing loans $2.4 million in REO and $300,000 in other repossessed assets. While elevated in comparison to recent years, these credit metrics remain modest in light of Banner's loan loss, reserve and capital positions and are indicative of our culture of early and proactive portfolio management. The net provision for credit losses for the quarter was $3 million including a $3.2 million provision for loan losses and a release of 200,000 related to unfunded loan commitments. Loan losses in the quarter totaled $4 million and were offset in part by recoveries totaling $1.8 million for the year. Net losses totaled a nominal two basis points of average total loans. The provision is the result of the increase in adversely classified loans as well as the moderate loan growth experienced this quarter and now provides coverage of 1.37% of total loans. This compares to coverage of 1.38% as of both the linked quarter. And as of year end 2023, loan originations declined moderately when compared to the linked quarter, largely due to muted construction and development loan closings and further impacted by reduced consumer demand in the quarter loan outstandings. However, grew by $130 million a quarter and were up $544 million year-over-year representing 5% growth. I am pleased to note that during the quarter, our commercial lending teams were successful in bringing previous clients back to Banner as well as closing new and expanding existing relationships. This included several new commercial real estate loans reflected in the growth of both owner and investor. CRE totals together with small balance CRE commercial real estate totals were up $72 million or 8% on an annualized basis. Similar growth is reflected in the commercial and small business loan totals up $37 million and $16 million, respectively. Quarter-over-quarter C&I utilization is up 1% this quarter and year-over-year commercial balances grew by 5% with small business loans growing another 8%. The reduction in multifamily construction quarter over quarter reflects the payoff of affordable housing projects upon completion of construction and receipt of the various term funding sources year over year. However, the multifamily construction portfolio is up 2% as we continue to support both affordable housing projects and to a lesser extent middle income projects to strong developers across the footprint. The residential construction portfolio at 5% of total loans continues to perform well. The for sale product is still benefiting from a reduced level of resale inventory in this higher interest rate environment. And while modestly increasing the level of completed and unsold starts remains below historical norms. The percentage of all in one custom construction projects has continued decline over the past year with commitments down approximately 30% as the higher rate environment has muted demand for this product. Land and land development loans were basically flat in the quarter but have increased by 10% year-over-year as builders seek to replenish lot inventories that will be necessary in the coming years. Together, when you consider residential, commercial and multifamily construction along with land and land development, the total construction exposure remains at an acceptable 14% of total loans. As expected, the agricultural loans began their seasonal decline with balances down $6 million or 2% in comparison to the linked quarter. And lastly, we reported modest growth of $16 million or 1% in the consumer mortgage portfolio in the quarter moderated in large part by the $35 million pool portfolio sale during the fourth quarter. I will close by reiterating that our credit metrics remain solid and reflected reflective of our moderate risk profile. We continue our long history of robust quarterly portfolio reviews and the level of adversely classified assets remains modest as a percentage of total loans at the close of 2023. I messaged that our credit quality metrics should not be expected to further improve. Given the economic uncertainty at the time, that statement proved true. As did my follow-up that we remain well-positioned to navigate the balance of the economic cycle. We were and we are well-positioned to navigate this cycle with a granular loan portfolio that is supported by a strong balance sheet, a robust reserve for credit losses and capital levels well in excess of regulatory requirements. With that, I will hand the microphone over to Rob for his comments. Rob? Robert Butterfield Great. Thank you, Jill. We reported $1.34 per diluted share for the fourth quarter compared to $1.30 per diluted share for the prior quarter. The 4% increase in earnings per share was primarily due to increases in net interest income and noninterest income partially offset by higher expenses compared to the prior quarter. Total loans increased $83 million during the quarter with portfolio loans increasing $130 million, partially offset by held for sale loans decreasing $47 million. The decrease in held for sale loans was primarily due to a poole loan sale of $35 million. The loan-to-deposit ratio ended the quarter at 84%. Total securities decreased $146 million primarily due to fair value decreases as a result of interest rates increasing during the quarter as well as normal portfolio cash flows. Deposits decreased by $24 million during the quarter due to time deposits decreasing $22 million. While core deposits were essentially flat, core deposits ended the quarter at 89% of total deposits same as the prior quarter. Total borrowings increased $32 million during the quarter. Banner's liquidity and capital profile continue to remain strong with robust core funding base, a low reliance on wholesale borrowing and significant off balance sheet borrowing capacity. In addition, all of our capital ratios are in excess of regulatory well-capitalized levels. Net interest income increased $4.9 million from the prior quarter due to tax equivalent net interest margin increasing 10 basis points to 3.82% and average earning assets increasing $91 million. The 10-basis-point increase in net interest margin was driven by the 13-basis-point decrease in funding costs as a result of deposit cost decreasing eight basis points and a larger percentage of funding coming from lower costing deposits as a result of average borrowing balances declining $180 million. The current quarter also benefited from a balance sheet hedge with a negative carry maturing during the quarter which added 4 basis points to margin. Noninterest bearing deposits into the quarter at 34% of total deposits. The increase in average earning assets was due to average loan balances increased $112 million partially offset by total average interest bearing cash and investment balances decreasing $21 million. The yield on earning assets decreased 2 basis points driven by loan yields, decreasing 2 basis points and yields on investment and cash decreasing 5 basis points. The decrease in loan yields was the result of variable rate, variable rate loans repricing down due to reductions in the fed funds, interest rates partially offset by adjustable rate loans repricing higher, as well as new production continuing to come on at interest rates above the overall portfolio yield. And the benefit of the previously mentioned balance sheet hedge maturity. The average rate on new loan production for the quarter was 7.56% total. Non-interest income increased $2 million from the prior quarter primarily due to a gain of $735,000 on the sale of a non-performing loan and a gain of $508,000 on the previously mentioned pooled loan sale. Total non-interest expense increased $3.2 million from the prior quarter. The increase reflected higher professional fees and marketing expenses as well as the prior quarter benefiting from a payroll tax rate fund of $800,000. Our capital and liquidity position gives us the capacity to grow the balance sheet in 2025. This concludes my prepared comments. And now I'll turn it back to Mark. Mark Grescovich Thank you, Jill and Rob, for your comments. That concludes our prepared remarks. And Marie, we will now open the call and welcome questions. Question and Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions) Jeff Rulis, D.A. Davidson. Jeff Rulis Thank you. Good morning. Mark Grescovich Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Rulis A quick question for Rob on the margin. Anything with any other -- were the recoveries at all in the quarter that helped the margin or -- Robert Butterfield Yeah. Nothing of an unusual nature there, Jeff. Yeah, it was really, it was really just the funding cost. That was probably the surprise there. I mean, we saw the decline in deposit costs of eight basis points, but funding costs were down 13 basis points really because our average outstanding FHLP advances were essentially zero for the quarter. So the spread between funding costs and deposit costs benefited it. And then, then we also had that balance sheet hedge that I mentioned in my prepared comments that rolled off about halfway through the quarter. That was at a negative carry. So that added four basis points to the margin. Jeff Rulis On the hedge. Do we do -- we kind of treat that as it's just, it's not one time in nature the benefit was, but the, it's not as if that. I guess I'm trying to back into kind of a core margin. Nothing artificial in the 382 is kind of what I'm getting at, I suppose. Robert Butterfield Yeah, that's correct. Yeah. Now that the balance sheet had rolled off, we'll continue to get that benefit each quarter going forward. So the 382 was a pure number. Jeff Rulis And Rob, do you have the December average on margin? Robert Butterfield Yeah, it was a few basis points higher than the quarterly. Deposit costs were 3 basis points lower. So deposit costs for 150 compared to 153 for the quarter. So call it, call it 2 or 3 basis points higher for December compared to the quarter. Jeff Rulis And then, as you view '25 in terms of rate positioning, say were to be done with cuts, you get a couple. Is there any kind of general sensitivity from here? Sounds like you're gaining ground on the deposit cost front. More of a wind at the back of the margin but just trying to check in on your view of '25. Robert Butterfield Sure. Yeah, if we first look at the first quarter of the year, given the rate cut that we saw in December, I would expect them to be relatively flat in Q1 as loan yields will be down a few basis points. That's 29% of our portfolio that are floating or price down within 30 days and this will be partially offset by adjustable rate, loans continue to price up. On the funding side. I would expect to see some decline in deposit costs in the first quarter, but we'll likely see an increase in some of the wholesale borrowing just because Q4 was so unusually low. So I think this will result in the funding cost and a smaller reduction in the first quarter compared to deposit cost. If I just think about the rest of the year in general, I would expect him to be flat to down in a quarter following a rate cut, assuming no rate cut, I would expect that margin would be up a few basis points each quarter. Jeff Rulis I appreciate it. That's very helpful. Maybe Mark strategically wanted to check in on the on the mortgage business that you know how to, how to appear in the, in the region with w fed exiting the announcing the exit of the mortgage business or the single family mortgage business or originating. If you see any opportunity in that, given your, your platform and expertise in that, in that segment. Mark Grescovich Yeah. Thank for the question, Jeff. Look, I think mortgage banking has been a strength of this organization for 100 and 34 years. That's what we were founded on. We have focused our mortgage banking business in conjunction with our community bank and retail banking platform and we continue to see great opportunity in the mortgage operation. And I think as more people exit, I think we have a core competency that we'll be able to take advantage of quite a bit of the market disruption that's occurring. Now, we need some cooperation obviously with interest rates. And hopefully with some pressure from the regulatory agencies to reduce some of the burden to get projects to, to build, I think we're going to have some good opportunity in the mortgage banking business. Jeff Rulis Great. And one quick last one, Jill, 5% growth in '24 picking similar levels in '25 as you said today. Jill Rice Yeah, we are targeting mid signal digit growth rates for 2025. Jeff. You know, our commercial pipelines were healthy at the end of the year even with the strong pull through. The only thing that, I caveat all of my loan growth with the negative implications of the interest rate, environment, potential immigration reform, tariffs, all of that could cause that to pull back some. But as of right now, yes, we're targeting mid single digits. Jeff Rulis Great. Thank you. Operator Andrew Terrell, Stephens. Andrew Terrell Hey. Good morning. Mark Grescovich Hey, Andrew. Andrew Terrell Hey. If I could just start on I appreciate all the color on the margin on the loan growth there just on expenses. How should we be thinking about expense growth in 2025? And can you maybe highlight any specific investments you're looking to make? Robert Butterfield Sure. Thanks, Andrew. It's Rob. So yeah, I mean, in general, what I would say for expenses is that I would start with Q4 is kind of a current run rate and then I would expect to see an increase from that in 2025 just based on normal inflationary increases, normal wage increases, that type of stuff as far as investments that we're making right now. I mean, we've talked about the new loan and deposit origination system that's expected to go live in Q2 this year. Initially, I would expect that will add to expenses initially as we get it fully rolled out. But once that's fully rolled out, I would expect it to start to create some efficiencies within the organization and, and add to the scalability of the organization as we continue to grow the balance sheet. Andrew Terrell Got it. Okay. And if I could just ask a follow up on the margin, I guess I'm, I'm trying to better understand if the margin was up, 10 basis points and in the quarter, I get that, four of that was related to the hedge benefit but that, carries forward and it sounds like you're, you're at a pretty decent kind of starting point. In December. So far I'm, I'm, I'm curious as to how the margin could, maybe not, not go up in the first quarter. Is it, is it really just, like kind of floating asset repricing down and you don't have as much benefit on the deposit cost side or can you just expand on the, on the one team margin dynamics a bit? Robert Butterfield Yeah, I think that's, I think you hit there. I mean, we have the guaranteed reduction the variable rate product and we know that's coming. But the other side of it, the deposit cost side of it, which is a little more uncertain out there right now. I think what we saw is that the first 50 basis points, I would say industry wide competitor wise, we saw a higher deposit data being taken on the first 50 basis points and then the last 225 basis points cuts. What we've seen there is now that there's this potential, higher for longer, slower, slow down rate rate cuts from the FED. It seems like some of the competitors are starting to slow down at this point with the beta that they're taking out of that. So I'm building in part of that just is this idea that we might not be able to get as much out of the December 25-basis-point rate cut on the deposit side. Andrew Terrell Got it. Understood. And that makes a lot of sense. Okay. Thank you for taking the questions. Mark Grescovich Thank you, Andrew. Operator David Feaster, Raymond James. David Feaster Hey. Good morning, everybody. Mark Grescovich Good morning, David. David Feaster I just wanted to to follow up kind of on the loan growth side. You first of all, just if you could just touch on kind of the pulse of your clients, what you're hearing, I mean, with the new year, the new election and all that, what, what's the pulse of your clients? What are you hearing there? And then you saw a nice uptick in C&I originations curious where you're seeing opportunity and, and kind of what drove that. Jill Rice Thanks, David. So, as I initially said that there's a level of optimism among the clients, but it's tempered with a kind of wait and see what really happens with some of these other, activities with the change in the administration. But the C&I loan growth as we talked about before, it takes a long time to pull that through. That's been, in the pipeline for some time and it is across the market. So we saw C&I growth, if you were looking at, the loan portfolio growth, California, we saw C&I growth there, we saw C&I growth in Washington and then in the growth you're seeing in Washington and California, it's really owner occupied and nonowner occupied as well more in the nonowner investor real estate in the California market owner occupied in Washington. But you know, our, our opportunities are still diversified across the footprint in both product and geography. David Feaster Okay. Perfect. And then again, you guys have done a great job, working on reducing deposit costs and you know, you alluded to some of the dynamics and the prepared remarks about, deposit balances and interest bearing movement and all that kind of stuff. But I I'm just curious, as you, as you have these conversations with your clients to reduce deposit costs, you guys have done a great job doing it earlier with less lag. Have you seen any attrition? Have you had any pushback at all? And just how do you think about your ability to further reduce deposit costs? And, and also on the other side, continue driving core deposit growth? Robert Butterfield Yes, David. So what I would say there is that, the conversations that we have directly with the clients is, is more tied to the exception price clients and they tend to be you know, some of our larger business clients are more sophisticated in nature. And so I think they've been receptive to the reductions that we've done there to this point just because they understand, the interest rate environment and that all interest rates are going down from a market standpoint. So I think as long as we remain competitive in the interest rates that we're paying them, which we are, then we haven't seen much pushback there necessarily. And I can't say there's been any real, exiting of clients or changing related to the reductions that we've done to this point. These clients are long term loyal clients to Banner. We've been, obviously there to support their business growth over the years and we're paying them competitive rates. Mark Grescovich And David, this is Mark, let me just add that, we do put in the release that we actually increased the number of accounts that we had at the end of the year compared to the last quarter, but the average balance has stayed the same. So even though we've had some rate reductions, we really haven't seen a shift away from our, our clients closing accounts are moving. David Feaster Okay. That's helpful. And then just put on credit broadly. I mean, credit, you guys do a very good job, proactively and aggressively managing credit, quick to downgrade, slow to upgrade and all that curious. I is there anything that you're seeing broadly, you know, that that's causing you any concern or just curious what you're seeing on the credit side and then just specifically within the AG segment, just looking at the reserve allocation that you guys provide, you continue to, to increase the allocation to ag curious what you're seeing there is there and is there anything that you're specifically worried about on that front? Jill Rice So to add the lower commodity prices have certainly impacted some of the borrowers within that portfolio and that could put more strain on the smaller borrowers in the near term. As you think about the reserving there. We had the downgrade to substandard last quarter in the egg portfolio. Part of the downgrade in this quarter as well are two additional egg credits in the Northern California market. So that's why you're seeing the reserve growing in that portfolio. I think it's important to reiterate that the egg portfolio is 3% of the loan book. So it's a pretty small percentage in total. But certainly we're watching that whole egg market with commodity prices and the cost of just general operations outside of that. It really, I expect that further credit deterioration is really going to be more idiosyncratic. But the higher interest rate environment has been, seen most notably across the consumer and small business sectors. So we're continuing to, keep our eyes there. David Feaster Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, everybody. Mark Grescovich Thank you, David. Operator (Operator Instructions) Andrew Liesch, Piper Sandler. Andrew Liesch Thanks. Good morning, everyone. We've heard quite a bit, we've heard quite a bit of optimism from your peers for the M&A environment for 2025. Mark, how has been the cadence and the pace of your conversations with prospective targets? Mark Grescovich Thank you for the question, Andrew. I would characterize it as the same that it has been for the last several quarters, I think. I think everybody is recognizing that it's a, it's still going to be a competitive environment. And even though that we've got a bit of a tailwind behind us, it's, it's going to be competitive, it's going to continue to be competitive. There's continued investment that needs to be made in technology and scale will matter. And so I would characterize the conversations as being positive and much more realistic in terms of what needs to be done over the course of the next several years and, and scale is going to mean that you can reinvest in your franchise and continue to take market share or at least hold on to market share by reinvesting in your organization and that's going to take scale. So I would characterize the conversations as positive. Andrew Liesch Got it. You've covered all my other questions. I'll step back. Thanks. Operator Kelly Motta, KBW. Kelly Motta Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I apologize if this has been covered already. I joined a bit late. But you know, looking across your, your four state footprint, you're in some, some really great markets, wondering, of your, your footprint are there areas where you're looking to add scale or density pick up teams? And if, where you're seeing the best growth opportunities right now, whether it be just driven by the economic engine of that MSA versus also just mortgage hurricanes. Mark Grescovich Thank you, Kelly. This is Mark. I think you summed it up very, very well, which is we're in some very excellent markets that we feel excited about in terms of growth and what may happen over the next several years in terms of economic prosperity in our regions. So I wouldn't characterize one particular market outside of any other. You know, in our footprint, what I would concentrate on is I don't see a reason for us to try and expand outside of our current footprint. We feel very good where we're at. We're creating brands in all of our markets and with the amount of market disruption that's occurring and continues to occur. Quite frankly, we've been very good at hiring and adding additional bankers in our footprint that fit the Banner Banner culture and will help us continue to build the brand. So I think there's going to be continued opportunity as most professional bankers want to associate themselves with an organization that is secure, safe sound and can deliver consistent performance through all economic cycles. And that's exactly what Banner is doing and we're gaining attention and, and being the employer of choice in many cases. Kelly Motta Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just one more follow up question the loan growth outlook. It feels like many of our banks are getting more optimistic about their loan growth prospects. You guys grew loans 5% this year and I think you reiterated mid single digits again. Is that number conservative? And what could be the factors that could drive you above that growth rate or are you really trying to stay, stay balance on growth? I'm just just wondering if there's potential upside to that growth number and, and how that could look and play out. Jill Rice Sure. I mean, on the one hand, market disruption could give a lot of upside to that number, but I can't ignore the potential downsides either which is the uncertainty that I talked about. Kelly with the interest rate environment that we don't hire for longer immigration reform that could have a significant impact on several of our clients and you know, the ability to continue to grow and then tariffs as well in our marketplace, that certainly will have an impact. So I got to play the middle of the road there because you've got positives and negatives. So that's where we're at the mid single digit. Kelly Motta Got it. Fair enough. Thank you, Jill. I'll step back. Operator We currently have no further questions, so I will hand back to Mark for closing remarks. Mark Grescovich Thank you, Marie. As I stated, we're very proud of the Banner team in our 2024 performance. Thank you for your interest in Banner and for joining our call today. We look forward to reporting our results to you again next quarter. Have a great day, everyone. Thank you. Operator This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining.
