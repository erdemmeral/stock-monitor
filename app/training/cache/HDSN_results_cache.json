[{"text": "Siemens (SIEGY) Stock Jumps 3.6%: Will It Continue to Soar? Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 3:15 PM 2 min read In This Article: SIEGY +0.15% Siemens AG (SIEGY) shares soared 3.6% in the last trading session to close at $106.90. The move was backed by solid volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This compares to the stock's 4.5% gain over the past four weeks. Siemens shares gained since the news that the company received a $24.3 million contract for the electrification of the Sivok-Rangpo rail line in India by IRCON International. The company will employ advanced technologies, including its rigid overhead catenary system and predictive maintenance solutions. This will allow SIEGY to establish new standards for train electrification in difficult terrains. Recently, Siemens eMobility announced that it was selected as the technology partner for two major electric vehicle charging infrastructure projects in Italy. The company will partner with Autolinee Toscane to provide 73 charging points to support zero-emission bus fleets in Tuscany. It will collaborate with IPLANET to provide 120 locations with 300-400 kW Siemens chargers and renewable energy integration technology. This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.05 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -34.4%. Revenues are expected to be $18.7 billion, down 5.7% from the year-ago quarter. Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements. For Siemens, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions. So, make sure to keep an eye on SIEGY going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Zacks Equity Research Fri, Jan 10, 2025, 6:00 PM 2 min read In This Article: HDSN -0.17% Investors in Hudson Technologies, Inc. HDSN need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Feb 21, 2025 $4 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. What is Implied Volatility? Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy. What do the Analysts Think? Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Hudson Technologies shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Hudson Technologies is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Industrial Services industry that ranks in the Bottom 8% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analyst increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one has dropped the estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from earnings of 1 cent per share to a loss of 2 cents in that period. Given the way analysts feel about Hudson Technologies right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected. Looking to Trade Options? Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners. In addition to impressive profit potential, these trades can actually reduce your risk. Click to see the trades now >> Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

-0.17% RELL +0.23% TITN +0.14% Q3 Earnings Roundup: Hudson Technologies (NASDAQ:HDSN) And The Rest Of The Specialty Equipment Distributors Segment Let\u2019s dig into the relative performance of Hudson Technologies (NASDAQ:HDSN) and its peers as we unravel the now-completed Q3 specialty equipment distributors earnings season. Historically, specialty equipment distributors have boasted deep selection and expertise in sometimes narrow areas like single-use packaging or unique lighting equipment. Additionally, the industry has evolved to include more automated industrial equipment and machinery over the last decade, driving efficiencies and enabling valuable data collection. Specialty equipment distributors whose offerings keep up with these trends can take share in a still-fragmented market, but like the broader industrials sector, this space is at the whim of economic cycles that impact the capital spending and manufacturing propelling industry volumes. The 10 specialty equipment distributors stocks we track reported a slower Q3. As a group, revenues were in line with analysts\u2019 consensus estimates. While some specialty equipment distributors stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they have collectively declined. On average, share prices are down 3.7% since the latest earnings results. Hudson Technologies (NASDAQ:HDSN) Founded in 1991, Hudson Technologies (NASDAQ:HDSN) specializes in refrigerant services and solutions, providing refrigerant sales, reclamation, and recycling. Hudson Technologies reported revenues of $61.94 million, down 19% year on year. This print fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations by 6.3%. Overall, it was a slower quarter for the company with some shareholders anticipating a better outcome. Brian F. Coleman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Hudson Technologies commented, \u201cOur third quarter results reflected continued pricing pressure that persisted for certain refrigerants throughout the 2024 cooling season. While disappointing in the near term, pricing trends are only one element of our business model and we remain confident in our long-term growth strategy to capitalize on the phasedown of HFC refrigerants and the expected corresponding growth in demand for reclaimed refrigerants. With our current visibility, we are adjusting our expectation for full year 2024 revenue, which we anticipate will be at the low end of the guidance range we previously provided, with full year gross margin of approximately 28%.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 5 Growth Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

(NASDAQ:HDSN) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 74% of the company editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Mon, Dec 30, 2024, 1:53 PM 4 min read In This Article: HDSN -0.17% Key Insights Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Hudson Technologies' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions The top 14 shareholders own 52% of the company Recent purchases by insiders Every investor in Hudson Technologies, Inc. ( NASDAQ:HDSN ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 74% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Hudson Technologies. Check out our latest analysis for Hudson Technologies NasdaqCM:HDSN Ownership Breakdown December 30th 2024 What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Hudson Technologies? Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Hudson Technologies. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Hudson Technologies' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. NasdaqCM:HDSN Earnings and Revenue Growth December 30th 2024 Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Hudson Technologies. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Ernest Lazarus with 8.8% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.4% and 5.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. Additionally, the company's CEO Brian Coleman directly holds 2.0% of the total shares outstanding. Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 52% of the ownership is controlled by the top 14 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too. Story Continues Insider Ownership Of Hudson Technologies While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Hudson Technologies, Inc.. Insiders own US$30m worth of shares in the US$244m company. It is great to see insiders so invested in the business. It might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public Ownership With a 13% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Hudson Technologies. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders. Next Steps: I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified 2 warning signs for Hudson Technologies (1 shouldn't be ignored) that you should be aware of. But ultimately it is the future , not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future .

Optimistic About Hudson Technologies' (NASDAQ:HDSN) Earnings editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Fri, Nov 15, 2024, 1:27 PM 3 min read In This Article: HDSN -0.17% Shareholders appeared unconcerned with Hudson Technologies, Inc.'s ( NASDAQ:HDSN ) lackluster earnings report last week. We did some digging, and we believe the earnings are stronger than they seem. View our latest analysis for Hudson Technologies NasdaqCM:HDSN Earnings and Revenue History November 15th 2024 Examining Cashflow Against Hudson Technologies' Earnings As finance nerds would already know, the accrual ratio from cashflow is a key measure for assessing how well a company's free cash flow (FCF) matches its profit. In plain english, this ratio subtracts FCF from net profit, and divides that number by the company's average operating assets over that period. You could think of the accrual ratio from cashflow as the 'non-FCF profit ratio'. That means a negative accrual ratio is a good thing, because it shows that the company is bringing in more free cash flow than its profit would suggest. While having an accrual ratio above zero is of little concern, we do think it's worth noting when a company has a relatively high accrual ratio. Notably, there is some academic evidence that suggests that a high accrual ratio is a bad sign for near-term profits, generally speaking. Over the twelve months to September 2024, Hudson Technologies recorded an accrual ratio of -0.24. That implies it has very good cash conversion, and that its earnings in the last year actually significantly understate its free cash flow. In fact, it had free cash flow of US$81m in the last year, which was a lot more than its statutory profit of US$30.9m. Hudson Technologies shareholders are no doubt pleased that free cash flow improved over the last twelve months. That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates. Our Take On Hudson Technologies' Profit Performance Happily for shareholders, Hudson Technologies produced plenty of free cash flow to back up its statutory profit numbers. Based on this observation, we consider it possible that Hudson Technologies' statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! And the EPS is up 38% annually, over the last three years. At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly. Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved. For instance, we've identified 2 warning signs for Hudson Technologies (1 doesn't sit too well with us) you should be familiar with.

Hudson Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:HDSN) Performing In The Near Term editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sun, Nov 10, 2024, 4:32 PM 2 min read In This Article: HDSN -0.17% The analysts covering Hudson Technologies, Inc. ( NASDAQ:HDSN ) delivered a dose of negativity to shareholders today, by making a substantial revision to their statutory forecasts for next year. Both revenue and earnings per share (EPS) estimates were cut sharply as the analysts factored in the latest outlook for the business, concluding that they were too optimistic previously. Following the latest downgrade, the current consensus, from the four analysts covering Hudson Technologies, is for revenues of US$239m in 2025, which would reflect a perceptible 3.4% reduction in Hudson Technologies' sales over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are supposed to dive 35% to US$0.44 in the same period. Previously, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$286m and earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.87 in 2025. It looks like analyst sentiment has declined substantially, with a measurable cut to revenue estimates and a large cut to earnings per share numbers as well. View our latest analysis for Hudson Technologies NasdaqCM:HDSN Earnings and Revenue Growth November 10th 2024 It'll come as no surprise then, to learn that the analysts have cut their price target 28% to US$7.31. Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. These estimates imply that sales are expected to slow, with a forecast annualised revenue decline of 2.7% by the end of 2025. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 16% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the same industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 5.4% annually for the foreseeable future. It's pretty clear that Hudson Technologies' revenues are expected to perform substantially worse than the wider industry. The Bottom Line The most important thing to take away is that analysts cut their earnings per share estimates, expecting a clear decline in business conditions. Unfortunately analysts also downgraded their revenue estimates, and industry data suggests that Hudson Technologies' revenues are expected to grow slower than the wider market. After such a stark change in sentiment from analysts, we'd understand if readers now felt a bit wary of Hudson Technologies. That said, the analysts might have good reason to be negative on Hudson Technologies, given its declining profit margins.

Just Beat Analyst Forecasts, And Analysts Have Been Updating Their Predictions editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 1:57 PM 3 min read In This Article: HDSN -0.17% There's been a major selloff in Hudson Technologies, Inc. ( NASDAQ:HDSN ) shares in the week since it released its third-quarter report, with the stock down 23% to US$5.88. Results look mixed - while revenue fell marginally short of analyst estimates at US$62m, statutory earnings beat expectations 7.9%, with Hudson Technologies reporting profits of US$0.17 per share. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year. See our latest analysis for Hudson Technologies NasdaqCM:HDSN Earnings and Revenue Growth November 7th 2024 After the latest results, the consensus from Hudson Technologies' four analysts is for revenues of US$239.0m in 2025, which would reflect a small 3.4% decline in revenue compared to the last year of performance. Statutory earnings per share are expected to dive 35% to US$0.44 in the same period. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$286.3m and earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.87 in 2025. Indeed, we can see that the analysts are a lot more bearish about Hudson Technologies' prospects following the latest results, administering a real cut to revenue estimates and slashing their EPS estimates to boot. The consensus price target fell 28% to US$7.31, with the weaker earnings outlook clearly leading valuation estimates. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. There are some variant perceptions on Hudson Technologies, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$8.00 and the most bearish at US$7.00 per share. This is a very narrow spread of estimates, implying either that Hudson Technologies is an easy company to value, or - more likely - the analysts are relying heavily on some key assumptions. Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. We would highlight that revenue is expected to reverse, with a forecast 2.7% annualised decline to the end of 2025. That is a notable change from historical growth of 16% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the same industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 5.4% annually for the foreseeable future. So although its revenues are forecast to shrink, this cloud does not come with a silver lining - Hudson Technologies is expected to lag the wider industry. Story Continues The Bottom Line The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. On the negative side, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. Furthermore, the analysts also cut their price targets, suggesting that the latest news has led to greater pessimism about the intrinsic value of the business. With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. We have estimates - from multiple Hudson Technologies analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.

Hudson Technologies Simply Wall St Value Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Overview: Hudson Technologies is a company engaged in the wholesale distribution of miscellaneous products, with a market capitalization of $1.09 billion. Operations: Hudson Technologies generates revenue primarily from its wholesale operations, with a notable gross profit margin of 44.53% in March 2022. The company's cost of goods sold (COGS) significantly impacts its profitability, as seen in various periods where COGS closely aligns with or exceeds revenue figures.

Despite this decline and lowered 2024 revenue guidance, insider confidence remains evident as they repurchased 326,028 shares between August and September for US$2.63 million under an expanded buyback plan now authorized up to US$20 million. The company's funding relies entirely on external borrowing, adding risk but potentially positioning it for strategic growth if managed well amidst forecasted earnings declines over the next three years.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% in November), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by potential trade policy changes and corporate tax discussions, which could impact business confidence and growth. The path forward holds both optimism and caution as new policies take shape. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% in November), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by potential trade policy changes and corporate tax discussions, which could impact business confidence and growth. The path forward holds both optimism and caution as new policies take shape. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals?
