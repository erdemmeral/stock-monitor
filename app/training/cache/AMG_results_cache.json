[{"text": "Earnings Preview: Affiliated Managers Group (AMG) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline Zacks Equity Research Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 6:00 PM 5 min read In This Article: AMG -2.24% JHG -0.98% Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Affiliated Managers Group (AMG) reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates. The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This asset manager is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.02 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -12.2%. Revenues are expected to be $530.4 million, up 5.5% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.09% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change. Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Story Continues Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Affiliated Managers? For Affiliated Managers, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.05%. On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4. So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Affiliated Managers will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue? Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Affiliated Managers would post earnings of $4.82 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.82, delivering no surprise. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times. Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Affiliated Managers doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release. Expected Results of an Industry Player Among the stocks in the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry, Janus Henderson Group plc (JHG) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.97 per share for the quarter ended December 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +18.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $693.96 million, up 22.1% from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Janus Henderson Group has been revised 1.3% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.62%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate. When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Janus Henderson Group will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.

Carlyle Cash and Allegedly Paid for Yacht, Winery Luca Casiraghi, Giulia Morpurgo and Antonio Vanuzzo Tue, Jan 28, 2025, 9:45 AM 6 min read In This Article: CG -3.53% (Bloomberg) -- It seemed like a low-risk bet when in 2020 Carlyle Group Inc. agreed to provide around \u20ac200 million ($210 million) in private bonds to Pro-Gest SpA, a family-owned paper and packaging company based near Venice.

The pandemic helped boost demand for paper packaging and Carlyle agreed to step in to refinance a portion of Pro-Gest\u2019s debt when the company offered some of its best assets as collateral. The deal put the American private capital giant first in line for repayment in case anything went wrong, ahead of bondholders who had previously given the company \u20ac250 million. Fast forward to 2025 and the company, after defaulting on some of its debt, is now attempting to restructure its obligations in a court-supervised process known locally as composizione negoziata. The move follows months of negotiations with creditors that saw the company\u2019s board overhauled, its first chief restructuring officer suddenly depart and \u2014 amid the negotiations with creditors \u2014 a draft report from the auditing firm Deloitte LLP that raised questions about more than \u20ac80 million of financial transactions by Pro-Gest and its owners, members of the Zago family. The expenses questioned included payments for a yacht and cash used to fund a prosecco winery. The draft report was presented to Pro-Gest\u2019s board, but never acted on. The company\u2019s current CRO Angelo Rodolfi said in a statement to Bloomberg that claims the firm misused cash are \u201cincorrect and untrue.\u201d But the episode underscores the difficulties often faced by lenders in the booming world of private credit. A few of the industry\u2019s largest players have made lending to companies that aren\u2019t owned by private equity a key piece of their strategy, hoping to reduce their reliance on buyout financing \u2014 an increasingly competitive and lower-return business \u2014 to deploy capital. While the loans typically come with high yields, they\u2019re often provided to businesses that aren\u2019t accustomed to the same high levels of disclosure and scrutiny as publicly traded borrowers. Pro-Gest\u2019s debt came from the Carlyle Credit Opportunities fund, a strategy launched in 2019 to provide capital \u201cprimarily for upper middle market borrowers,\u201d including firms owned by families and entrepreneurs, according to the fund\u2019s website. Story Continues By early last year, Pro-Gest had breached some of the terms governing the Carlyle debt, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because they aren\u2019t authorized to talk about it. While the US fund agreed to waive the breaches of financial covenants, it wanted to appoint independent directors to the board. And as part of the compromise between family owners and the fund, the board commissioned Deloitte to conduct a forensic analysis of Pro-Gest\u2019s finances and transactions with related parties. Deloitte analyzed internal accounting, collected material on the company\u2019s IT devices through December 2023, and produced a draft report in May 2024 that identified potential anomalies with a total financial impact of about \u20ac81.6 million. Some of these transactions may have impacted Pro-Gest\u2019s balance sheet, and others may have breached covenants in Carlyle\u2019s debt and disclosure obligations, Deloitte said in the report. It also said founder Bruno Zago and other members of his family may have used company funds to pay for non-business-related expenses. After Deloitte completed its draft report, a round of interviews with some employees and managers backed its preliminary findings, and the report was filed to Pro-Gest\u2019s board for review, the people said. Over the summer, however, the chief restructuring officer and other independent directors suddenly resigned after less than six months in the post. A new CRO and new board members were appointed, and while they received Deloitte\u2019s draft report, they never voted on it, the people said. As part of CRO Rodolfi\u2019s response to Bloomberg in December, he said that claims the firm misused cash and the representation of events \u201care harmful and defamatory.\u201d He didn\u2019t comment on the details of the allegations contained in Deloitte\u2019s draft report. The company said in a separate email response in early January that its own financial reports are correct. Representatives for Deloitte and Carlyle declined to comment on the draft report. Alleged Breaches Deloitte said it found 16 transactions that were in breach of the financial covenants of the debt Pro-Gest got from Carlyle. And it singled out 29 cases when the company\u2019s cash coffers, which had been boosted by Carlyle\u2019s funds, were allegedly used for non-business purposes. The list of breaches includes a \u20ac1.4 million purchase of a Ferretti Custom Line 94 yacht, and zero-interest loans to several Zago family members and close allies, some of which weren\u2019t paid back, according to the draft report. Deloitte\u2019s report also claimed Pro-Gest\u2019s funds were used to finance family businesses that are legally and financially separate from the packaging group, including one that makes prosecco in the hills of Veneto, and a local food catering company. And Deloitte\u2019s report said it found \u20ac12.5 million of \u201cfinancials granted by Pro-Gest in favor of AMG,\u201d a real estate company also owned by the Zago family. AMG didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Zago family members allegedly used company funds to pay for aircraft rentals for purposes not related to Pro-Gest\u2019s core business, and to cover about \u20ac530,000 in yacht maintenance costs between 2021 and 2024, according to the draft report. They also moved assets back-and-forth between the Pro-Gest group and entities controlled by the Zagos, the report alleged. For instance, in 2018 it sold \u20ac20 million worth of paper reels to World Cart Srl, a company in which Pro-Gest held a minority stake and whose biggest shareholder was Pro-Gest\u2019s founder. In 2021 and 2022, after the debt from Carlyle helped stabilize Pro-Gest\u2019s finances, the group bought back those assets from World Cart, which in turn directed a large chunk of its profits to benefit AMG, according to the draft report. Bruno Zago eventually transferred his stake in World Cart to Pro-Gest in October 2024, according to a corporate filing. Luca Lazzarotto, who owns 25% of World Cart and is the firm\u2019s chief executive officer, said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg that he isn\u2019t aware of strictly private information that was presented to Pro-Gest\u2019s board, and warned against spreading false reports. Debt Talks It\u2019s unclear what Carlyle did when Deloitte submitted its report to the board. A Carlyle spokesperson declined to comment when asked whether the fund had received the report when it was sent to Pro-Gest\u2019s board. Either way, Carlyle and unsecured creditors have been in on-and-off talks with the company to restructure its debt for more than a year. Pro-Gest stopped paying interest on its debt to bondholders in June, and didn\u2019t pay the unsecured notes when they matured on Dec. 15. The private bonds from Carlyle are due this year. This month, Pro-Gest said it had entered court-supervised negotiations and issued a proposal to extend debt maturities, sell assets and reduce rental costs. It also plans to recover funds credited to AMG. The court-supervised procedure, which protects the company against its creditors, can last as long as a year. --With assistance from Jessica Loudis.
