[{"text": "LIVE The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs Is Monarch Casino & Resort, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:MCRI) Recent Stock Performance Tethered To Its Strong Fundamentals? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 1:10 PM 4 min read In This Article: MCRI -0.60% Most readers would already be aware that Monarch Casino & Resort's (NASDAQ:MCRI) stock increased significantly by 14% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Monarch Casino & Resort's ROE. Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Monarch Casino & Resort How Is ROE Calculated? ROE can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Monarch Casino & Resort is: 17% = US$87m \u00f7 US$513m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024). The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.17 in profit. Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth? Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. Monarch Casino & Resort's Earnings Growth And 17% ROE To begin with, Monarch Casino & Resort seems to have a respectable ROE. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 12% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. This certainly adds some context to Monarch Casino & Resort's exceptional 26% net income growth seen over the past five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio. As a next step, we compared Monarch Casino & Resort's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 33% in the same period. NasdaqGS:MCRI Past Earnings Growth January 21st 2025 Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for MCRI? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Story Continues Is Monarch Casino & Resort Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits? Monarch Casino & Resort's ' three-year median payout ratio is on the lower side at 24% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (76%) of its profits. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number. Along with seeing a growth in earnings, Monarch Casino & Resort only recently started paying dividends. Its quite possible that the company was looking to impress its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 24%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 15%. Conclusion Overall, we are quite pleased with Monarch Casino & Resort's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

Trump's tariffs Findings from pivotal nipocalimab Phase 3 study in a broad antibody positive population of people living with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) published in The Lancet Neurology PR Newswire Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 1:35 PM 12 min read In This Article: JNJ -0.18% The first FcRn blocker to demonstrate sustained disease control over 24 weeks in antibody positive adult patients: anti-AChR+, anti-MuSK+, anti-LRP4+ Nipocalimab demonstrated a sustained reduction in autoantibody levels, one of the underlying causes of gMG, by up to 75% over a period of 24 weeks The investigational therapy was recently granted U.S. FDA Priority Review for the treatment of gMG SPRING HOUSE, Pa. , Jan. 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) today announced The Lancet Neurology has published results from the pivotal Phase 3 study of nipocalimab, an investigational FcRn blocker, evaluated in a broad population of antibody positive (anti-AChR+, anti-MuSK+, anti-LRP4+) adults with generalized myasthenia\u00a0gravis (gMG). 1 The Vivacity-MG3 study met its primary endpoint demonstrating statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement over 24 weeks in the MG-ADL a score. 1 Nipocalimab had a tolerable safety profile, with adverse events leading to discontinuation rates similar to placebo (5.1% with nipocalimab vs. 7.1% with placebo). 1 (PRNewsfoto/Johnson & Johnson) \"Nipocalimab has been shown in multiple clinical studies to help reduce IgG, including autoantibodies, among this broad population of antibody positive adults with gMG. The positive results from the Vivacity-MG3 study further support the potential of nipocalimab to address the underlying cause of this debilitating autoantibody disease,\" said Carlo Antozzi , M.D., Neuroimmunology and Muscle Pathology Unit of the Neurological Institute Foundation C. Besta of Milan, Italy . b \"It's promising to see this positive data published in The Lancet Neurology as there is a continued need for additional approved targeted therapies with demonstrated safety profiles that offer sustained disease control for a broad range of antibody positive patients living with gMG.\" gMG is a chronic, life-long, rare, autoantibody-driven disease, for which there currently is no cure. gMG impacts an estimated 700,000 people worldwide. 2,3 Nipocalimab, a fully human IgG1 antibody, is an immunoselective investigational therapy that has been shown in clinical trials to lower immunoglobulin G (IgG), including pathogenic IgG, one of the root causes of autoantibody diseases. 1 ,4 Data from the Phase 3 study showed up to a 75% reduction in the median pre-dose total IgG from baseline. Additionally, reduction in levels of common pathogenic IgG subclasses, including AChR antibody and MuSK antibody, was observed over 24 weeks of the study. 1 No changes were observed in total IgE, IgA, and IgM, highlighting the potential ability to maintain a protective immune system even after reduction of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies is observed. 1 Story Continues Nipocalimab plus standard of care (SOC) demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in MG-ADL response (\u22652-point improvement from baseline) compared with placebo plus SOC (p=0.0213). 1 For someone living with gMG, a 1- to 2-point change on MG-ADL may be the difference between normal eating and frequent choking on food, or shortness of breath at rest and requiring the assistance of a ventilator. 5 \"The Phase 3 Vivacity-MG3 data demonstrates our steadfast pursuit of researching and developing potential innovative and transformational approaches for autoantibody-driven diseases, such as gMG,\" said Sindhu Ramchandren , M.D., Executive Medical Director, Neuroscience, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. \"We are delighted by the publication of this robust Phase 3 data in The Lancet Neurology as well as the Priority Review granted by the FDA. People living with gMG require additional effective immunoselective therapeutic options that can potentially preserve the ability to maintain a protective immune response even after reduction of IgG.\" Johnson & Johnson submitted a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) seeking approval of nipocalimab in gMG on August 29 and September 11, 2024 , respectively. Nipocalimab was granted Priority Review by the FDA which was supported by findings from the Phase 3 Vivacity-MG3 study. 6,7 In addition, nipocalimab recently received U.S. FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe Sj\u00f6gren's disease as supported by results from the Phase 2 DAHLIAS study. 8 Editor's notes: a.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MG-ADL\u00a0(Myasthenia Gravis \u2013 Activities of Daily Living) provides a rapid clinical assessment of the patient's recall of symptoms impacting activities of daily living, with a total score range of 0 to 24; a higher score indicates greater symptom severity. 5 b.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dr. Carlo Antozzi has provided consulting, advisory and speaking services to Johnson & Johnson. He has not been paid for any media work. ABOUT GENERALIZED MYASTHENIA GRAVIS ( gMG) Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoantibody disease in which the immune system mistakenly makes antibodies (e.g., anti-acetylcholine receptor [AChR], anti-muscle-specific tyrosine kinase [MuSK] or anti-low density lipoprotein-related protein 4 [LRP4]), which target proteins at the neuromuscular junction and can block or disrupt normal signaling from nerves to muscles, thus impairing or preventing muscle contraction. 2,9,10 The disease impacts an estimated 700,000 people worldwide. 2 Approximately 10 to 15% of new cases of MG are diagnosed in adolescents (12 \u2013 17 years of age). 11,12,13 Among juvenile MG patients, girls are affected more often than boys with over 65% of pediatric MG cases in the U.S. diagnosed in girls. 14,15,16 Initial disease manifestations are usually ocular but in 85% or more cases, the disease generalizes (gMG), which is\u00a0characterized by fluctuating weakness of the skeletal muscles leading to symptoms like limb weakness, drooping eyelids, double vision and difficulties with chewing, swallowing, speech and breathing. 2,17,18,19,20 Approximately 100,000 individuals in the U.S. are living with gMG. 21 Vulnerable gMG populations, such as pediatric patients, have more limited therapeutic options. 22 Currently, SOC treatments for adolescents with gMG are extrapolated from adult trials. 13 Other than symptomatic treatments, there are no approved FcRn blockers that may address the root cause of the disease for adolescents with gMG in the United States . 13 ABOUT THE PHASE 3 VIVACITY-MG3 STUDY The Phase 3 Vivacity-MG3 study ( NCT04951622 ) was specifically designed to measure sustained efficacy and safety with consistent dosing in this unpredictable chronic condition where unmet need remains high. Antibody positive or negative adult gMG patients with insufficient response (MG-ADL \u22656) to ongoing SOC therapy were identified and 199 patients, 153 of whom were antibody positive, enrolled in the 24-week double-blind placebo-controlled trial. 23,24 Randomization was 1:1, nipocalimab plus current SOC (30 mg/kg IV loading dose followed by 15 mg/kg every two weeks) or placebo plus current SOC. 23 Baseline demographics were balanced across arms (77 nipocalimab, 76 placebo). 23 The primary endpoint of the study was mean change in MG-ADL a score from baseline over Weeks 22, 23 and 24 in antibody positive patients. A key secondary endpoint included change in QMG score. Long-term safety and efficacy were further assessed in an ongoing open-label extension (OLE) phase. 24 ABOUT NIPOCALIMAB Nipocalimab is an investigational monoclonal antibody, designed to bind with high affinity to block FcRn and reduce levels of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies potentially without impact on other immune functions. This includes autoantibodies and alloantibodies that underlie multiple conditions across three key segments in the autoantibody space including Rare Autoantibody diseases, Maternal Fetal diseases mediated by maternal alloantibodies and Rheumatic diseases. 25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33 Blockade of IgG binding to FcRn in the placenta is also believed to limit transplacental transfer of maternal alloantibodies to the fetus. 34,35 The U.S. FDA and\u00a0EMA have granted several key designations to nipocalimab including: U.S. FDA Fast Track designation in hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA) in July 2019 , gMG in December 2021 and fetal neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT) in March 2024 U.S. FDA Orphan drug status for\u00a0wAIHA in December 2019 , HDFN in June 2020 , gMG in February 2021 , chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) in October 2021 and FNAIT in December 2023 U.S. FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation for\u00a0HDFN in February 2024 and for Sj\u00f6gren's disease in November 2024 U.S. FDA granted Priority Review in\u00a0gMG in Q4 2024 EU EMA Orphan medicinal product designation for HDFN in October 2019 ABOUT JOHNSON & JOHNSON At Johnson & Johnson, we believe health is everything.

Trump's tariffs NeuroSigma Announces Patent Application Protecting Use of Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation to Include Treatment of Dyslexia and Other Neurodevelopmental Disorders NeuroSigma, Inc. Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 5:00 PM 2 min read NeuroSigma, Inc. LOS ANGELES, Jan. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NeuroSigma, Inc. , a\u00a0Los Angeles-based bioelectronics company commercializing the Monarch external Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation (eTNS) device for treating ADHD , today announced the filing of a new patent related to use of eTNS for treating neurodevelopmental disorders. The patent filing, Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation as Treatment for Neurodevelopmental Disorders and for Increasing Cognitive Performance, builds on scientific and clinical observations suggesting that eTNS may help improve reading performance in children with dyslexia and other learning disabilities, which tend to occur along with ADHD. \u201cThis new filing builds on certain clinical and neuroimaging findings which suggest that eTNS may improve reading ability in some patients with dyslexia,\u201d said Colin Kealey, M.D., President and CEO of NeuroSigma. \u201cWork by independent researchers has shown that long-term reading outcomes are improved in children who activate their right prefrontal cortex (rPFC) during reading activities. 1 Previous neuroimaging and EEG work has demonstrated that the rPFC is activated in patients receiving eTNS therapy, and that the degree of activation may be correlated with clinical outcome. We look forward to expanding on these findings in future clinical trials of eTNS for dyslexia and learning disabilities.\u201d \"NeuroSigma continues to build on its substantial intellectual property portfolio,\u201d added Tom Paschall, Director of NeuroSigma and CEO of Checkmate Capital. \u201cDyslexia, which adversely affects people\u2019s ability to read and understand written language, is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder. To date, there are no approved therapies. It is currently addressed through educational interventions and learning accommodations but lacks any tangible medical treatment regimen. The mechanistic and early clinical findings generated by NeuroSigma are intriguing and warrant additional clinical development for this common and debilitating condition.\u201d About NeuroSigma NeuroSigma is a Los Angeles, California-based bioelectronic medical device company developing technologies to transform medical practice and patients' lives. The company\u2019s lead product is the Monarch eTNS System, which is the first non-drug treatment for pediatric ADHD cleared by the FDA. Pipeline indications for the Monarch eTNS System include neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), learning disabilities, and epilepsy. NeuroSigma has received Breakthrough Device Designation for the Monarch eTNS System from the FDA in drug-resistant epilepsy. For more information about NeuroSigma, please visit www.neurosigma.com .
