[{"text": "Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) Will Be Hoping To Turn Its Returns On Capital Around editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 2:29 PM 3 min read In This Article: FL -5.84% To avoid investing in a business that's in decline, there's a few financial metrics that can provide early indications of aging. A business that's potentially in decline often shows two trends, a return on capital employed (ROCE) that's declining, and a base of capital employed that's also declining. Ultimately this means that the company is earning less per dollar invested and on top of that, it's shrinking its base of capital employed. In light of that, from a first glance at Foot Locker ( NYSE:FL ), we've spotted some signs that it could be struggling, so let's investigate. Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Foot Locker, this is the formula: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.024 = US$130m \u00f7 (US$6.9b - US$1.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to November 2024) . Thus, Foot Locker has an ROCE of 2.4%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Specialty Retail industry average of 13%.

If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Foot Locker . The Trend Of ROCE We are a bit worried about the trend of returns on capital at Foot Locker. About five years ago, returns on capital were 14%, however they're now substantially lower than that as we saw above. And on the capital employed front, the business is utilizing roughly the same amount of capital as it was back then. Since returns are falling and the business has the same amount of assets employed, this can suggest it's a mature business that hasn't had much growth in the last five years. If these trends continue, we wouldn't expect Foot Locker to turn into a multi-bagger. The Key Takeaway All in all, the lower returns from the same amount of capital employed aren't exactly signs of a compounding machine. Long term shareholders who've owned the stock over the last five years have experienced a 39% depreciation in their investment, so it appears the market might not like these trends either. With underlying trends that aren't great in these areas, we'd consider looking elsewhere.

Shoe Carnival (NASDAQ:SCVL) Max Juang Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 12:01 PM 5 min read In This Article: SCVL -5.91% BOOT -9.53% DBI -6.16% FL -5.84% Reflecting On Footwear Retailer Stocks\u2019 Q3 Earnings: Shoe Carnival (NASDAQ:SCVL) As the Q3 earnings season wraps, let\u2019s dig into this quarter\u2019s best and worst performers in the footwear retailer industry, including Shoe Carnival (NASDAQ:SCVL) and its peers. Footwear sales\u2013like their apparel counterparts\u2013are driven by seasons, trends, and innovation more so than absolute need and similarly face the bigger-picture secular trend of e-commerce penetration. Footwear plays a part in societal belonging, personal expression, and occasion, and retailers selling shoes recognize this. Therefore, they aim to balance selection, competitive prices, and the latest trends to attract consumers. Unlike their apparel counterparts, footwear retailers most sell popular third-party brands (as opposed to their own exclusive brands), which could mean less exclusivity of product but more nimbleness to pivot to what\u2019s hot. The 4 footwear retailer stocks we track reported a slower Q3. As a group, revenues missed analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 2% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was in line. Amidst this news, share prices of the companies have had a rough stretch. On average, they are down 5.4% since the latest earnings results. Shoe Carnival (NASDAQ:SCVL) Known for its playful atmosphere that features carnival elements, Shoe Carnival (NASDAQ:SCVL) is a retailer that sells footwear from mainstream brands for the entire family. Shoe Carnival reported revenues of $306.9 million, down 4.1% year on year. This print fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations by 3%. Overall, it was a slower quarter for the company with a slight miss of analysts\u2019 gross margin and EBITDA estimates. \u201cOur Back-to-School results were strong, with comparable store sales growth across our banners and robust margins. Our flexible digital-first marketing campaign and great brand assortment drove demand during this peak shopping period and profitability in line with expectations for the third quarter. I am very proud of our team for delivering the Company\u2019s profit results despite two significant hurricanes disrupting third quarter sales and a very warm October that delayed the start of our winter boot season,\u201d said Mark Worden, President and Chief Executive Officer.

Market Update In response to the Fed's rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has been gradually trending down from its post-pandemic peak, trending closer to the Fed's 2% target. Despite higher borrowing costs, the economy has avoided flashing recessionary signals. This is the much-desired soft landing that many investors hoped for. The recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% in November 2024) have bolstered the stock market, making 2024 a strong year for equities. Donald Trump\u2019s presidential win in November sparked additional market gains, sending indices to record highs in the days following his victory. However, debates continue over possible tariffs and corporate tax adjustments, raising questions about economic stability in 2025. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals?

What you may have missed Foot Locker names Sonia Syngal to board of directors Foot Locker on Tuesday announced two additions to its board of directors , including former Gap Inc. CEO Sonia Syngal . Syngal, who is also on Tanger\u2019s board, has two decades of experience in retail, including in e-commerce, supply chain, brand strategy, operations and marketing, per a company press release.

New Balance sales hit a record New Balance this week said its global sales hit a record $7.8 billion in 2024, a year that\u2019s been tough for sneaker brands like Nike and Under Armour, as well as some resale sites. This was a 20% increase from the previous year and a whopping 136% from five years ago. The company credits its partnerships with Olympic gold medalist and world record holder Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone and Los Angeles Dodgers designated hitter Shohei Ohtani, plus its collabs with brands like Kith and Aim\u00e9 Leon Dore. \u201cThrough selective partnerships and distribution, they\u2019ve elevated the brand to premium status while breathing new life into retro styles that resonate with younger consumers like never before,\u201d the 119-year-old brand said in an emailed press release. Story Continues Retail therapy That don\u2019t impress me much Earlier this week, Walmart unveiled what it called \u201ca comprehensive brand refresh\u201d \u2014 the first of its kind since 2008 . The refresh includes more vibrant yellows and blues, greater emphasis on its spark logo and a new wordmark that was inspired by founder Sam Walton\u2019s classic trucker hat. While Walmart dubs this the first refresh in nearly 20 years, onlookers weren\u2019t impressed. Commenting on the changes, one X user commented \u201csimply increase saturation a bit and you have a bold new direction,\u201d while another sarcastically called the refresh \u201cso bold and visionary.\u201d Even discount grocer Aldi poked fun at the retail giant\u2019s big reveal, posting side-by-side images of its logo on Instagram with the caption \u201cSpot the difference! #IYKYK\u201d Walmart seems to have stayed in good spirits despite the backlash, even poking fun at itself. On its X account on Wednesday, the retailer posted increasingly thicker versions of its spark logo with the text, \u201cThe future is bright\u2026and slightly more thick.\u201d Pasta lovers unite Ahead of Valentine\u2019s Day, Barilla Canada released heart-shaped pasta on Wednesday. The limited-edition Barilla Love Pasta will be available at Walmart, IGA, Metro Quebec and other grocery stores based in Canada while supplies last. The pasta debuted in the U.S. in previous years and per Barilla, \u201cCanadians pleaded with the brand to make the special pasta available,\u201d in the country. What we\u2019re still thinking about 61 That\u2019s how many years Ronald S. Lauder spent with Est\u00e9e Lauder before his recent retirement from the board of directors . On Jan. 10, Est\u00e9e Lauder said the longtime executive and board member, who joined the company in 1964, would retire from the company\u2019s board of directors. In his time at the company, Ronald Lauder served on the board from 1968 to 1986, from 1988 to July 2009 and from 2016 till now. He designated two directors of the company per a shareholder agreement with the Lauder family: his daughter Jane Lauder and son-in-law Eric Zinterhofer. Ronald Lauder plans to remain chairman of Clinique Laboratories. 3,283 That\u2019s how many retail-related job cuts there were in December , up 2,800% from the year-ago period when there were 110 cuts, according to a recent report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. From the previous month, December\u2019s job cuts grew nearly 45%. While cuts in December grew, for the full year retail downsizing narrowed by 47%. Retailers continued to make hires during the year as well, with the number of hirings reaching 536,600 in 2024, compared to 440,893 in 2023. What we\u2019re watching Will the California fire recovery drive home improvement growth? As residents and businesses attempt to recover from the devastation of the Los Angeles-area wildfires, growth is likely to surge for some retail sectors in the coming years. In a Wednesday note, Wells Fargo analysts said home improvement retail \u2014 companies like The Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s and Tractor Supply \u2014 are likely well-positioned for growth due to rebuilding-related demand as the emergency situation is brought under control. As of Friday, about 25 people had died, over 40,000 acres had burned and more than 12,300 structures were destroyed , according to state officials. In the two largest incidents, the Palisades fire was about 31% contained, while the Eaton fire was 65% contained as of Friday, per The Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. AccuWeather figures cited by Wells Fargo estimated the total damage and economic loss ranged between $250 billion and $275 billion. Assuming 75% of the structures were housing units and rebuilding materials will cost between $1 million to $2 million per unit, that could represent a $10 billion to $20 billion home improvement sector tailwind during the next one to two years, Wells Fargo said. Wayfair, RH and others in the home furnishings segment are also likely to see a benefit as area residents refurnish their homes.

Footwear Retailer Stocks As the craze of earnings season draws to a close, here\u2019s a look back at some of the most exciting (and some less so) results from Q3. Today, we are looking at footwear retailer stocks, starting with Designer Brands (NYSE:DBI). Footwear sales\u2013like their apparel counterparts\u2013are driven by seasons, trends, and innovation more so than absolute need and similarly face the bigger-picture secular trend of e-commerce penetration. Footwear plays a part in societal belonging, personal expression, and occasion, and retailers selling shoes recognize this. Therefore, they aim to balance selection, competitive prices, and the latest trends to attract consumers. Unlike their apparel counterparts, footwear retailers most sell popular third-party brands (as opposed to their own exclusive brands), which could mean less exclusivity of product but more nimbleness to pivot to what\u2019s hot. The 4 footwear retailer stocks we track reported a slower Q3. As a group, revenues missed analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 2% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was in line.

Market Update The Fed\u2019s interest rate hikes throughout 2022 and 2023 have successfully cooled post-pandemic inflation, bringing it closer to the 2% target. Inflationary pressures have eased without tipping the economy into a recession, suggesting a soft landing. This stability, paired with recent rate cuts (0.5% in September 2024 and 0.25% in November 2024), fueled a strong year for the stock market in 2024. The markets surged further after Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory in November, with major indices reaching record highs in the days following the election.

Barn (NYSE:BOOT) Impresses Petr Hu\u0159\u0165\u00e1k Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 12:03 PM 5 min read In This Article: BOOT -9.53% SCVL -5.91% DBI -6.16% FL -5.84% Q3 Footwear Retailer Earnings: Boot Barn (NYSE:BOOT) Impresses As the Q3 earnings season wraps, let\u2019s dig into this quarter\u2019s best and worst performers in the footwear retailer industry, including Boot Barn (NYSE:BOOT) and its peers. Footwear sales\u2013like their apparel counterparts\u2013are driven by seasons, trends, and innovation more so than absolute need and similarly face the bigger-picture secular trend of e-commerce penetration. Footwear plays a part in societal belonging, personal expression, and occasion, and retailers selling shoes recognize this. Therefore, they aim to balance selection, competitive prices, and the latest trends to attract consumers. Unlike their apparel counterparts, footwear retailers most sell popular third-party brands (as opposed to their own exclusive brands), which could mean less exclusivity of product but more nimbleness to pivot to what\u2019s hot. The 4 footwear retailer stocks we track reported a slower Q3. As a group, revenues missed analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 2% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was in line. While some footwear retailer stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they have collectively declined. On average, share prices are down 4.8% since the latest earnings results. Best Q3: Boot Barn (NYSE:BOOT) With a strong store presence in Texas, California, Florida, and Oklahoma, Boot Barn (NYSE:BOOT) is a western-inspired apparel and footwear retailer. Boot Barn reported revenues of $425.8 million, up 13.7% year on year. This print was in line with analysts\u2019 expectations, but overall, it was a mixed quarter for the company with a solid beat of analysts\u2019 EBITDA estimates but EPS guidance for next quarter missing analysts\u2019 expectations. Mr. Starrett stated, \u201cJohn Hazen is very highly regarded within the Boot Barn organization and has a diverse background that includes brand building, digital, and store roles. He has a strong track record of growing sales and profits both at Boot Barn and prior to joining the Company. He also has been extremely instrumental in advancing Boot Barn\u2019s customer-facing technology capabilities including many industry-leading applications of artificial intelligence. I am confident in his ability to step into the role as Interim CEO. Personally, I am looking forward to providing oversight and mentorship as Executive Chairman while the Board conducts an internal and external search before making a permanent decision on our next CEO.\u201d Boot Barn Total Revenue Boot Barn achieved the biggest analyst estimates beat, fastest revenue growth, and highest full-year guidance raise of the whole group. The results were likely priced in, however, and the stock is flat since reporting. It currently trades at $162. Story Continues Is now the time to buy Boot Barn?

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our 9 Best Market-Beating Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Zacks Equity Research Fri, Jan 3, 2025, 7:30 PM 6 min read In This Article: FL -5.84% URBN -3.14% A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Foot Locker (FL). Shares have added about 2.4% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500. Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Foot Locker due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts. Foot Locker Q3 Earnings Miss Expectations, 2024 View Down Foot Locker posted third-quarter fiscal 2024 results, with both bottom and top lines lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company\u2019s revenues decreased and earnings increased from the year-ago quarter. The company saw positive comparable sales trends and gross margin expansion, but third-quarter performance fell short due to softened consumer spending after the Back-to-School period and a more promotional environment. Progress continued with the Lace Up Plan and partnerships, including the 'Home Court' experience with Nike and Jordan Brand and a deal with the Chicago Bulls. While early November trends were weak, there was a strong acceleration during Thanksgiving week. The company lowered its full-year outlook due to softer demand and a more promotional environment but remains focused on growth through new store formats, a revamped digital experience and enhanced customer engagement, aiming for an 8.5-9% EBIT margin by 2028. More on Foot Locker\u2019s Q3 Financial Results The athletic shoes and apparel retailer posted adjusted earnings of 33 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of adjusted earnings of 39 cents. However, the figure increased from adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 30 cents in the prior-year quarter. Total revenues of $1,961 million decreased 1.4% from the year-ago period. Excluding the impacts of foreign-currency fluctuations, total sales decreased 2.2%. Revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,001 million. Comparable sales increased 2.4% year over year, driven by a 2.8% increase in global Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker sales. Notably, the Champs Sports and WSS banners also reported positive comparable sales growth of 2.8% and 1.8%, respectively. Insight Into FL\u2019s Margins FL's gross margin rate increased 230 basis points (bps). This was primarily due to lower markdown levels. The selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 210 bps from the prior-year period. This increase was due to investments in technology and brand-building investments. However, it was partially offset by savings from the cost-optimization program and ongoing expense discipline.
