(Photo: Business Wire) Exterior photo of the Daugherty Lofts development, providing 39 affordable homes. (Photo: Business Wire) CLINTON, Tenn., January 24, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Hunt Capital Partners, in collaboration with Hickory Creek Capital Partners, celebrated the grand opening and ribbon cutting for Daugherty Lofts in downtown Clinton, Tennessee on Thursday, January 23 rd . Located at 307 N Main Street, Daugherty Lofts is the adaptive reuse of the Daugherty Lofts Furniture Company Building, a popular 1942 retail store that was enlisted on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010, to create a mix of 39 one-, two-, and three-bedroom loft-style apartment homes for workforce families. The property is comprised of a five-story midrise building that introduces affordable housing for families earning up to 50% and 60% of the Area Median Income (AMI). To mark the special occasion, speeches were provided by key partners including Hickory Creek Capital Partners Founder Kent Leach, Clinton City Mayor Scott Burton, Anderson County Chamber of Commerce Head Rick Meredith, and Hunt Capital Partners Acquisitions Senior Director Mike Jacobs. Chelsea Ivens, State Field Director from the office of U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn, and Emily McCaul, Regional Field Director from the office of U.S. Senator Hagerty, were also in attendance to support the grand opening. The ribbon cutting was followed by home tours and light refreshments. \"It's been a long road starting in 2020 when we won the tax credits just as COVID was getting started. We've faced every adversity you could think of \u2013 rising construction costs, rising interest rates, material shortages, longer lead times, just to name a few. But seeing these doors open and people moving into their new homes, it makes me realize we've done a really good thing here,\" said Hickory Creek Capital Partners Founder Kent Leach. \"Not only have we given an old building new life, we're making these really unique living spaces available at an affordable rent. It really makes it worth all the adversity we've gone through.\" Daugherty Loft has a rich history deeply intertwined with the transformative period of World War II, particularly through the economic boom brought by the Manhattan Project in nearby Oak Ridge. During this era, Anderson County saw a significant surge in population growth due to the influx of workers which, in turn, spurred local economies by increasing demand for various household commodities like furniture, hardware, and appliances. These items were essential for accommodating the rapidly growing workforce. Today, projects like Daugherty Lofts aim to honor and preserve this historical essence through adaptive reuse. This approach not only conserves the architectural integrity and cultural heritage of such buildings, but also repurposes them for contemporary use, notably for affordable housing. This method of redevelopment provides a sustainable solution by revitalizing sturdy, abandoned structures to meet community needs while retaining their historical significance. Story Continues \"The adaptive reuse of the Daugherty building represents a testament to innovate housing solutions, which protects the structure\u2019s historical legacy while offering new housing options for families who need an affordable place to live,\" said Hunt Capital Partners Chief Operating Officer Amy Dickerson. \"We\u2019re proud to partner with Hickory Creek Capital Partners to add 39 high-quality, desirable affordable homes that blend history with function right in the historic downtown district of Clinton.\" The apartment homes are equipped with central air conditioning, ceiling fans, and coat and walk-in closets, as well as in-unit appliances such as a refrigerator, microwave, and dishwasher. Spacious area amenities include a community room, computer lab, central laundry, lounge area, and elevators. The rehabilitated building preserves its architectural character with features such as original milk doors, a 20 th century stone exterior, metal casement windows, rustic hardwood floors, and a restored 5 th floor skylight. Residents will have access to services provided by Anderson County Community Action Commission, a local non-profit agency dedicated to mobilizing social services within Anderson County since 1965. Services range from a weekly food pantry to rent and utility assistance. Daugherty lofts was financed, in part, with $9.1 million in federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits and $1.4 million in Historic Tax Credits (HTCs) syndicated by Hunt Capital Partners. Legacy Bank & Trust provided $10.6 million in construction financing and $2.1 million in permanent financing. Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development provided $300,000 in grand funding. River and Valley Department, LLC provided a $650,000 soft seller note. Hickory Creek Capital Partners is the general partner for the development. Frizzell Construction Company, Inc. is the general contractor and Goss Design Development is the architect of record. D&K Management, Inc. is the property manager. Environmental Social and Corporate Governance (\"ESG\") Investing Hunt Capital Partners recognizes that its institutional investors are seeking to increase the social value of their investments to help further their ESG initiatives. Investment in affordable housing not only improves the living conditions of its residents, but it also helps to remove obstacles that stand in the way of creating a healthy, safe and stable home environment for low-income families and seniors. When families spend less on housing related expenses, they have more resources available for other essentials such as food and clothing, or even extracurricular activities and educational programs. One of the most significant benefits to providing quality affordable housing is an increase in an individual\u2019s physical and mental health. Hunt Capital Partners\u2019 affordable housing investments create a lasting effect on the people and communities they serve for generations to come.

additional indications - Xyngari \u2122 with Daxxify\u00ae has the potential to be the first approved needle-free intradermal delivery of a botulinum toxin product - SAN DIEGO, CA and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, CA / ACCESS Newswire / January 21, 2025 / Dermata Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:DRMA)(NASDAQ:DRMAW) (\"Dermata\") and Revance Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: RVNC) (\"Revance\" together with Dermata \"Companies\") today announced the Companies have entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement to evaluate the topical application of Xyngari\u2122 (formerly known as DMT310), Dermata's topical Spongilla powder, with Daxxify\u00ae (daxibotulinumtoxinA-lanm), Revance's botulinum toxin type A. The Companies intend to first evaluate Xyngari\u2122 with Daxxify\u00ae for the topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis and may explore additional indications through a broader partnership in the future. \"We are excited to partner with Revance to further clinical development of our unique program, using our Xyngari\u2122 product for a needle-free, intradermal delivery of a botulinum toxin, like Daxxify\u00ae, to the dermis,\" said Gerald Proehl, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Dermata. \"This clinical development collaboration will provide the cooperative framework to fully evaluate the treatment effect of Xyngari\u2122 with Daxxify\u00ae for treating hyperhidrosis and potentially additional medical and aesthetic indications. We believe that the unique broad coverage ability of Xyngari\u2122, with a long-lasting botulinum toxin like Daxxify\u00ae, could provide patients with a potentially superior treatment option than current injections of a botulinum toxin with a needle.\" \"Revance is excited to partner with Dermata to jointly explore the potential for Daxxify\u00ae and Xyngari\u2122 for the needle-free treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis and to expand the opportunities for Daxxify\u00ae beyond injections,\" commented Mark Foley, Chief Executive Officer of Revance. Phase 2a Clinical Trial Design The Phase 2a clinical trial will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Xyngari\u2122 and Daxxify\u00ae versus Xyngari\u2122 and placebo in patients with moderate-to-severe axillary hyperhidrosis for 16 weeks. The trial will be randomized (1:1:1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, enrolling approximately 48 patients across sites in the United States. The endpoints will be the percent of patients with greater than 50% reduction in gravimetrically measured sweat production from baseline, the percent of patients with gravimetric sweat production less than 50mg, and the mean absolute change from baseline in gravimetrically measured sweat production. Patients will be evaluated at 4 regular intervals. Story Continues Daxxify\u00ae has received approval in the United States for specific uses in treating moderate to severe glabellar lines and cervical dystonia, while Xyngari\u2122 is currently in a Phase 3 clinical program in moderate-to-severe acne. Daxxify's proprietary formulation is manufactured without the use of animal or human proteins and contains highly purified 150 kDa core neurotoxin and the patented peptide excipient RTP004. Xyngari\u2122 with Botulinum Toxin Program Xyngari\u2122 with botulinum toxin is the Dermata's treatment regimen that uses the unique mechanical features of Xyngari\u2122 to facilitate the intradermal delivery of a botulinum toxin by topical application rather than through multiple injections with a needle. Xyngari's\u2122 microscopic spicules penetrate the stratum corneum to create microchannels into the dermis allowing for the topical application and penetration of botulinum toxin. Dermata has successfully completed proof-of-concept Phase 1 clinical trials using Xyngari\u2122 with a botulinum toxin for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis and for the treatment of multiple aesthetic skin conditions. Both studies showed promising efficacy results and appeared to be safe and well tolerated by patients.

Daxxify \u00ae (daxibotulinumtoxinA-lanm) injection IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION INDICATIONS Daxxify \u00ae (daxibotulinumtoxinA-lanm) injection is an acetylcholine release inhibitor and neuromuscular blocking agent indicated for the temporary improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe glabellar lines associated with corrugator and/or procerus muscle activity in adult patients and for the treatment of cervical dystonia in adults. WARNING: DISTANT SPREAD OF TOXIN EFFECT The effects of Daxxify \u00ae and all botulinum toxin products may spread from the area of injection to produce symptoms consistent with botulinum toxin effects. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death. Daxxify \u00ae is not approved for the treatment of spasticity or any conditions other than cervical dystonia and glabellar lines. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Contraindications Daxxify\u00ae contraindications include hypersensitivity to any botulinum toxin preparation or any of the components in the formulation and infection at the injection site(s). Warnings and Precautions Please refer to Boxed Warning for Distant Spread of Toxin Effect. The potency units of Daxxify\u00ae are not interchangeable with preparations of other botulinum toxin products. Recommended dose and frequency of administration should not be exceeded. Patients should seek immediate medical attention if respiratory, speech or swallowing difficulties occur. Use caution when administering to patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease.

Price to $3.65 per Share and Extend Existing Tender Offer PR Newswire Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 4:00 PM 10 min read In This Article: RVNC -0.14% Increased offer price to $3.65 per share, a $0.55 per share increase Improved offer unanimously approved by\u00a0Revance Board of Directors Crown to extend tender offer until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time , on February 4, 2025 Crown's offer is the only fully-financed offer currently available to\u00a0Revance's stockholders Outside termination date under the A&R Merger Agreement is February 7, 2025 JOHNSON CITY, Tenn. and NASHVILLE, Tenn. , Jan. 21, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Crown Laboratories, Inc. (\"Crown\") and\u00a0Revance Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: RVNC) (\"Revance\"), today announced that, on January\u00a017, 2025, they amended their previously announced Amended and Restated Merger Agreement (the \"Second Amendment,\" together with the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement, dated December\u00a07, 2024, the \"A&R Merger Agreement\"). Crown Laboratories (PRNewsfoto/Bellus Medical, a division of Crown Laboratories) Under the terms of the Second Amendment, which has been unanimously approved by the Revance Board of Directors, Revance's stockholders will receive $3.65 per share of common stock, par value\u00a0$0.001\u00a0per share (each, a \"Share\") in cash, without interest and less any applicable tax withholding, representing $0.55 or 17% per share more than the prior offer price. Crown will extend its existing tender offer for all of Revance's outstanding Shares until one minute past\u00a011:59\u00a0p.m., Eastern Time, on\u00a0February\u00a04, 2025. \"We are pleased to have reached this agreement with Crown which increases value for our stockholders while also providing them with deal certainty,\" said Mark J. Foley , Chief Executive Officer of Revance. \"After a robust process, our Board concluded that Crown's offer represented the best outcome for our stockholders. Crown's offer is the only fully-financed offer currently available to Revance's stockholders, and we recommend they tender their shares in support of the transaction.\" \"Our improved and fully-financed offer provides a meaningful increase in the consideration paid to Revance's stockholders, and we are pleased that the Revance Board of Directors has unanimously endorsed it,\" said\u00a0Jeff Bedard, founder and Chief Executive Officer of Crown. \"We look forward to closing the transaction in short order so we can bring the companies together and continue working on our important mission.\" Transaction and Tender Offer Details The Crown transaction, which has been unanimously recommended by Revance's Board of Directors, is the only fully-financed offer that Revance has received since the parties initially entered into the original merger agreement on August 11, 2024 , and in the more than six weeks since the parties entered into the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement on December 7, 2024 . Story Continues Crown's tender offer, which was previously scheduled to expire one minute past\u00a011:59\u00a0p.m., Eastern Time, on\u00a0January\u00a028, 2025, has been extended until one minute past\u00a011:59\u00a0p.m., Eastern Time, on\u00a0February\u00a04, 2025, unless the tender offer is further extended or earlier terminated. Subject to customary closing conditions, including the tender of more than 50% of the Shares into the tender offer, the transaction is expected to close by February\u00a06, 2025. The outside termination date for the A&R Merger Agreement (as amended by the Second Amendment) remains February\u00a07, 2025. Crown does not intend to extend the outside termination date of the A&R Merger Agreement. There is not sufficient time for a third party to consummate a tender offer for the Shares prior to February 7, 2025 , at which time the Crown offer will have lapsed due to the outside termination date. Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the depositary and paying agent for the tender offer, has advised Crown that, as of\u00a04:00\u00a0p.m., Eastern time, on\u00a0January\u00a017, 2025, approximately 6,322,768 Shares have been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn in the tender offer, representing approximately 6.025% of the issued and outstanding Shares, as of such date and time. Holders that have previously tendered their Shares do not need to\u00a0re-tender\u00a0their Shares or take any other action in response to the extension of the tender offer. The tender offer continues to be subject to the remaining conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase that Crown and its acquisition subsidiary filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), as amended or supplemented from time to time. Complete terms and conditions of the tender offer can be found in the Offer to Purchase, the Letter of Transmittal, and certain other materials contained in the tender offer statement on Schedule TO originally filed with the\u00a0U.S. SEC on December\u00a012, 2024 by Crown and its acquisition subsidiary, as amended and as may be further amended from time to time, and are available at\u00a0www.sec.gov. Except as described in this press release, the terms of the tender offer remain the same as set forth in the Offer to Purchase, the Letter of Transmittal, in each case, as amended.

in schizophrenia Boehringer Ingelheim Limited Thu, Jan 16, 2025, 6:05 PM 5 min read Boehringer Ingelheim Limited Boehringer healthcare HCP Illustrative image Boehringer Ingelheim today announced top-line results from the Phase III CONNEX clinical program in cognitive impairment in adults with schizophrenia, showing primary and key secondary endpoints were not met. 1\u20136 Overall, no statistically significant effects on cognition or functioning were observed in patients treated with iclepertin versus placebo at six months. 1 All three trials demonstrated that iclepertin, a glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) inhibitor, was generally well tolerated, with a safety profile that remains consistent with previous studies. 1,2,7 \u201cWhile these findings are disappointing, we remain dedicated to finding effective solutions for those living with serious mental illnesses. Our innovative pipeline includes over 20 additional investigative therapies in all stages of development and in different disease areas including schizophrenia and major depressive disorder,\u201d said\u00a0Shashank Deshpande, Member of the Board of Managing Directors and Head of Human Pharma at Boehringer Ingelheim. \u201cIn the near future more can be expected. Our gratitude goes to the patients and clinical investigators whose time and commitment made this research possible.\u201d CONNEX was the largest program for cognitive impairment in schizophrenia to date. Boehringer believes that the results will aid scientific understanding and inform future research for patients living with cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, an area of high unmet need with no approved targeted pharmaceutical treatment options available. 8,9 Full efficacy and safety data will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting. About cognitive impairment in schizophrenia Schizophrenia affects approximately 24 million people worldwide. 10 Cognitive impairment is one of the three core symptom domains of schizophrenia, along with positive and negative symptoms. 11 Cognitive impairment affects more than 80% of people with this condition, manifesting early in patients\u2019 lives, and representing a leading cause of disability and impairment in daily functioning. 8,9,12 People with schizophrenia often face cognitive challenges that impact their problem-solving abilities, attention and memory. 8,9 These problems can make it difficult to live an independent and productive life. 8,9 They can also cause a person to struggle with simple tasks such as attending appointments, which can make treatment difficult. 8,9 There are no approved targeted pharmaceutical treatments for cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. 8,9 Story Continues About iclepertin and the CONNEX clinical program Iclepertin (BI 425809), an investigational oral inhibitor of glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1), was studied as a potential treatment for cognitive impairment in adults with schizophrenia. 1\u20136 Iclepertin has not been\u00a0approved by any regulatory authorities. CONNEX was a Phase III clinical program designed to assess the safety and efficacy of iclepertin for improving cognitive impairment in adults with schizophrenia. 2\u20136 The program comprised three clinical trials, all of which were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group trials investigating treatment with oral iclepertin 10 mg once daily over a 26-week period in adults with schizophrenia who received stable antipsychotic treatment. 2\u20136 The CONNEX clinical program enrolled 1,840 patients in 41 countries. 4\u20136 Boehringer Ingelheim decided to discontinue the long-term extension trial, CONNEX-X, effective immediately. 13 Boehringer Ingelheim Boehringer Ingelheim is a biopharmaceutical company active in both human and animal health.
