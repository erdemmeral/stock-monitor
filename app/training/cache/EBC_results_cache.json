As was mentioned, with me today is Eastern's CEO, Denis Sheahan; and our CFO, David Rosato. As we close out the fourth quarter and reflect on another successful year, our most significant milestone was our merger with Cambridge Trust. This combination not only solidifies our position as the largest commercial bank headquartered in Greater Boston and a leading financial institution in New England but also allows us to deliver a broader suite of offerings to our customers, greater opportunities for our colleagues, and even stronger commitment to the communities we serve. As always, I want to express my endless gratitude to our 2,200 employees for all of their tremendous work and achievement in 2024. It's the values, talent, and commitment of our team that truly sets us apart. Story Continues Should you invest $1,000 in Eastern Bankshares right now?

Kim Dee joined Eastern as our new consumer banking director, bringing to us over 20 years of retail banking experience from Citizens Bank. We also have two retiring board members, Paul Connolly and Paul Spiess, whose valued insights have guided us well, particularly over the past five years' extraordinary transformation at Eastern.

With that, I'll hand it over to Denis, who will discuss our business in more detail, before handing it off to David to discuss our financial results. Denis Sheahan -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Bob. We ended the year -- we ended the year on a strong note with our fourth-quarter earnings, bringing us to full-year operating net income of $192.6 million, which is 18% higher than 2023. Net interest income of $607.6 million increased 10% from 2023, highlighted by a 12-basis-point expansion in the net interest margin. Period-end loans were up 29% from a year ago, benefiting from the addition of Cambridge Trust and organic growth. Our liquidity position remains strong with period-end deposits up 21% year over year, essentially no wholesale funding and a loan-to-deposit ratio of 85%. We continue to strategically deploy capital during the year, repurchasing $28.4 million worth of shares and increasing the dividend by 9%. We are now six months past the merger of Eastern and Cambridge, and we remain focused on continuing to capitalize on synergies, growth opportunities, and overall financial performance. The improvement in the company's performance ratios, mainly return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity and the outlook for continued improvement is very satisfactory. I'm pleased to report Cambridge clients and talent retention continues to be strong. This success reflects the thoughtful planning and seamless integration of Eastern and Cambridge, ensuring continuity and stability and creating a strong foundation for growth. Our branch network is well situated in and around Boston and Southern New Hampshire, the epicenter of the Midlands economy, and provides us with direct community connection to serve consumers and businesses. This branch network, combined with our talented staff, has earned us the No. 1 deposit market share among locally headquartered banks in the Boston MSA. We're hopeful that 2025 will bring renewed growth to our lending and deposit businesses but also recognize that the overall economic and rate environment could be a headwind. We remain open for business with a highly capable team well positioned to continue to serve our customers as loan demand strengthens. In this regard, we added talent in 2024 to both commercial and industrial lending and our wealth management businesses. Our commercial and industrial lending capability grew by adding four experienced lenders, and we added two seasoned members to business development in the wealth management division. Looking ahead, we will continue to add growth-oriented talent in commercial banking, business banking, deposit gathering, private banking, and wealth management. Our wealth management and private banking businesses are a key segment of our longer-term growth strategy. With over 8.3 billion in assets under management and 8.8 billion in assets under administration, we are the largest bank-owned independent investment advisor in Massachusetts and 12th largest in the state overall. We're confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth over time in wealth management, creating value for our clients and shareholders alike. To touch on the competitive landscape, there were two significant mergers announced in our footprint in the fourth quarter, creating even more consolidation here in Massachusetts. We are frequently asked about our interest in further acquisitions. Our answer remains the same. We are focused on organic growth and realizing the potential of our recent combinations. However, if an appropriate merger opportunity develops, we are interested, and we'll be disciplined. I have full confidence in our team's ability to execute on any acquisition opportunity. Most importantly, we remain committed to delivering on our financial objectives, and we have positive momentum as we look into the year ahead. In 2025, we'll have the full-year impact of the Cambridge merger, significant financial benefits from the investment restructure we just announced, and continued very robust levels of capital and liquidity that provide us with strategic and financial flexibility. David, I'll now hand it to you to review our fourth-quarter results. David Rosato -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Denis, and good morning, everyone. Please note, we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we encourage you to review as I will reference a number of those slides in my commentary. As a reminder, the Cambridge merger closed on July 12th, providing a partial quarter impact to the third quarter. Beginning with highlights on Slide 2 and the income statement on Slide 3. Our fourth-quarter financial performance was very positive and demonstrated the enhanced earnings power of the company with the addition of Cambridge. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $60.8 million or $0.30 per share. Operating net income was 68.3 million, up 37% linked quarter. On a per share basis, net operating income increased 36% to $0.34. These results were highlighted by an expanding net interest margin that increased 8 basis points in the quarter to 3.05 on an FTE basis. We are pleased with the continued improvement in returns. Operating ROA of 105 basis points increased 26 basis points linked quarter, while operating return on average tangible common equity of 11.3% was up from 8.5% in Q3. In addition, the operating efficiency ratio improved for the second consecutive quarter to 57.2%, driven by higher revenue. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with exceptional levels of capital and credit reserves as reflected by a year-end CET1 ratio of 15.7% and allowance for loan losses of 129 basis points. We continue to move through the credit cycle with investor office loans a primary focus. As we communicated last quarter, with the closing of the Cambridge merger, we took significant credit marks through merger accounting. Though our charge-offs were elevated in the quarter at 71 basis points, most of these were from PCD loans acquired from Cambridge that had specific reserves established last quarter. Importantly, we also announced this quarter that we are executing on a $1.2 billion repositioning of our investment portfolio that will accelerate improvement in financial performance and is expected to be $0.13 accretive to operating EPS in 2025. More on that later. Moving to the margin on Slide 4. Net interest income increased $9.3 million linked quarter due to improvement in the margin, as well as a merger-related increase in average earning assets. The margin expanded 8 basis points and is 41 basis points above the trial just two quarters ago. This demonstrates the positive financial impact of the Cambridge merger and our ability to manage funding costs lower with recent rate reductions from the Federal Reserve. Our asset yields declined 4 basis points compared to a decline in our liability cost of 17 basis points. Turning to Slide 5. Total noninterest income of $37.3 million increased 3.8 million linked quarter. On an operating basis, total noninterest income of $36.9 million was up 4 million. The largest driver of the increase was our wealth business with fees of 18 million, up $3.1 million linked quarter. However, this included a one-time item of 1.2 million in the fourth quarter. Excluding this item, wealth management fees were up 1.9 million or 13% linked quarter. Included in other noninterest income was a $9.3 million nonoperating gain due to Eastern's investment and Numerated growth technologies, which sold to Moody's in November. As a reminder, Numerated was a fintech start-up that was originally developed within the Eastern Bank, and we are pleased to see this result. We leveraged this gain to execute on the sale of 116 million of low-yielding securities in the quarter, which had a paired nonoperating loss of 9.2 million. This sale will provide incremental margin benefit going forward. We saw a $600,000 increase in customer swap fees and a $300,000 increase in deposit service charges as we reinstated fees for the Cambridge customer base that were previously waived. On Slide 6, total noninterest expense was 137.5 million, a decrease of 22.2 million linked quarter due to lower nonoperating merger-related costs. Fourth-quarter merger costs were 3.6 million, down from 27.6 million. On an operating basis, noninterest expense was 133.7 million, an increase of 2.9 million, driven by the partial-quarter impact of Cambridge in the third quarter. Moving to the balance sheet. Let's start with deposits on Slide 7. We saw stability in total deposits for the quarter as we balanced our excess liquidity position against deposit cost reductions. Our mix of deposits remain very favorable and improved in the quarter. Low-cost checking accounts, which comprised 50% of the total deposit balances, increased 180 million, while CDs declined 209 million. We continued to be fully deposit-funded with essentially no wholesale funding. We were able to reduce deposit costs by 13 basis points to 169 basis points in the quarter. As of year-end, our deposit costs were 155 basis points, demonstrating our ability to pass along the impact of Fed rate cuts to depositors. Looking ahead, the downward repricing of our CD book will continue to support lower deposit costs. If the Fed continues to ease, we will target deposit betas similar to our experience during the most recent tightening cycle or about 45% to 50% with modest lags relative to Fed actions while monitoring balances and competition. On Slide 8, loans were essentially flat in the quarter as new business was offset with paydowns and maturities. Consumer home equity lines were the exception with growth of $23 million in the quarter. The commercial loan pipeline remained steady at approximately $400 million, demonstrating our commitment and ability to support both existing and new borrowers. As Denis mentioned in his opening remarks, there are headwinds to loan growth in the environment. So, we remain ready and able to land, and we'll continue to explore new growth opportunities. We have an exceptional team of relationship managers and a deep understanding of our local communities, which differentiate Eastern within the markets we serve and positions us well to drive loan growth over time. Moving to the securities portfolio on Slide 9. We had some purchase and sale activity in the quarter that increased the portfolio yield 11 basis points to 1.95% as of year-end. Later in my remarks, I'll discuss the portfolio repositioning we're undertaking in the first quarter of this year. Turning to Slide 10. Capital levels remained robust, and we continued to return capital to shareholders. We purchased 908,000 shares in the quarter at an average price of $17.41, which was $0.09 below the VWAP, for a total cost of $15.8 million. We have also repurchased an additional 761,000 shares through yesterday, for a total cost of 13.1 million and now have 8.3 million shares remaining in our authorization that runs through the end of July. Our diluted common shares outstanding were 202.1 million as of December 31st. Additionally, our board approved a $0.12 dividend in the first quarter. Looking at overall asset quality on Slide 11. Our reserve levels remained strong, as evidenced by an allowance for loan losses of $229 million or 129 basis points of total loans. These metrics are down modestly linked quarter to 254 million or 143 basis points, primarily due to charge-off activity in the fourth quarter. Charge-offs totaled 31.7 million or 71 basis points to average loans, compared to 5.1 million or 12 basis points in the third quarter. The increase was mostly driven by investor office loans, of which approximately 20 million were PCD loans acquired from Cambridge that were fully reserved at closing. It is important to note that approximately 81% of the charge-offs this quarter were from previously established specific reserves. As a reminder, with the closing of the Cambridge merger last quarter, we set aside a total of $97 million on PCD and non-PCD loans to provide coverage for potential future charge-offs. Nonperforming loans increased 11.3 million in the quarter to 136 million or 76 basis points of total loans. This was driven by the move to nonaccrual status of two Eastern investor office loans, partially offset by charge-off activity. Criticized and classified loans decreased 234 million in the quarter to 595 million or 4.9% of total loans. We are pleased with the reduction and great work by our credit team. However, as the credit environment evolves in the office space, it would not be unexpected to see quarterly fluctuations over the course of the year. Finally, we booked provision of 6.8 million in the quarter, in line with recent legacy Eastern Bank history. On Slides 12 and 13, we provide details on total CRE and CRE investor office exposures. Total commercial real estate loans were 7.1 billion. Our exposure is largely within our local markets that we know well and is diversified by sector. Total nonowner occupied CRE to risk-based capital is very well contained at approximately 200%. Our largest exposure is to the multifamily sector at 2.5 billion, which is a very strong asset class here in Metro Boston, due to ongoing housing shortages. We have no multifamily nonperforming loans and have had no charge-offs in this portfolio in the last decade. Our focus continues to be on investor office loans, which we cover in detail on Slide 13. The investor office portfolio is $914 million or 5% of our total loan book. Criticized and classified loans ended the quarter at $184 million or about 20% of total investor office loans. Our reserve levels on this book declined in the quarter from 8% to 6.2%, due to Q4 charge-off activity. We continue to take a proactive approach to managing investor office exposures. Our credit teams performed thorough assessments of the portfolio on a quarterly basis and on larger, lower-risk graded credits, we conduct ongoing monthly reviews. This in-depth knowledge enables our credit team to make timely and decisive actions. Although we expect the credit cycle to continue to evolve, we are confident that our proactive approach allows us to deal with issues prudently but quickly and will serve us well in the quarters ahead. Moving to Slide 14. We announced a $1.2 billion investment portfolio repositioning to be completed this quarter. We are in the process of selling low-yielding, available-for-sale securities and reinvesting at current rate levels, which will improve financial performance. We have excess capital providing us with financial flexibility. We will rebuild roughly half of our CET1 capital ratio to stronger earnings by year-end. The after-tax nonoperating loss on the sale will be approximately $200 million and will be fully completed by mid first quarter 2025. We expect the transaction to be $0.13 accretive to operating EPS for the full year and to add approximately 10 basis points to ROA at approximately 95 basis points to return on tangible common equity. Slide 15 highlights several factors that will provide support to our margin looking ahead. On the asset side of the balance sheet, as we just discussed, the investment portfolio repositioning will add approximately 1% to the total portfolio yield. We also have a hedge portfolio that will begin to amortize in Q3 of this year, at which point, the loans will reset to market rates above the current strike rate based on the forward curve. On the liability side, we have $2.8 billion of CD maturities in Q1 and Q2 of this year that will reprice lower as our current highest CD offer is approximately 4%. Our interest rate risk position is essentially neutral when considering parallel shifts in the yield curve. However, we expect a steepening yield curve to be beneficial to our margin with a 25-basis-point reduction from the Fed anticipated to add approximately $7 million to net interest income on an annual basis. On Slide 16, we provide our full-year outlook for 2025. We expect modest balance sheet growth due to the economic and rate environments. Loan growth for '25 is anticipated to be 2% to 4%, deposit growth of 1% to 2%, with a favorable mix shift from CDs to money markets. Based on market forwards as of year-end, we anticipate net interest income to be in the range of $815 million to $840 million with a full-year FTE margin of 3.45 to 3.55. While provision will be based on the evolution of credit trends, we currently expect $30 million to $40 million of provision expense. Operating noninterest income is expected to be between $130 million and $140 million. This assumes modest client inflows but no market appreciation. Operating noninterest expense should be in the range of $535 million to $555 million. Finally, we expect the full-year tax rate on an operating basis to be between 22% and 23%.Overall, we anticipate our 2025 financial performance, as indicated by this outlook, will drive meaningful year-over-year improvements in ROA, return on tangible common equity, and the efficiency ratio. This concludes our comments for the quarter. And now, we'll open up the line for questions. Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] One moment, please, for your first question. Your first question comes from Mark Fitzgibbon with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Gregory Zingone -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst Hey, good morning, everyone. This is Greg Zingone stepping in for Mark. How are you? David Rosato -- Chief Financial Officer Good morning. Denis Sheahan -- Chief Executive Officer We're good, Greg. Gregory Zingone -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst Nice to speak with you guys again. First, could you share with us the average rate of the securities you were selling as part of the repositioning and the average rate and duration of the securities you were buying? David Rosato -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So, if you just go back and look at our Q3 materials, the average portfolio yield was about 182 to 184. We're buying, as you can imagine, a mix of security, asset classes, durations. The average yield on those buys -- if you had to pick one number, is about four and three quarters, a range between that and up to just under 5%. Gregory Zingone -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst Right. And then you said the type of securities were mixed? David Rosato -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. All I mean by that is -- I mean, so agency securities, there'll be a combination of CMBS providing strong lockout protection, agency mortgage-backed securities. In there, you'll -- when all is said and done, there will be a mix of 15 and 30 years discounts -- discount bonds, again, looking for a little call protection, and then some closer to current coupons. So, not unlike -- Greg, just a little more color there. Not unlike what we're selling, it's just substantially different price levels. Gregory Zingone -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst OK. And if our math is correct, you're taking a $200-million loss, and you'll pick up roughly 35 million in NII benefit per year. So, is that roughly a 5.7-year earn-back? David Rosato -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. The earn-back is longer than what you might see from some other banks that have done similar transactions. The earn-back is really driven by the securities you're selling. The situation at Eastern happens to be -- we became a public company four years ago. We raised a lot of capital. That capital, or a majority of that capital, was put into investment portfolio securities which, at that time, were very low in interest rates. That's why that portfolio yields, as I said, in the mid-180s pre-restructuring. So, that's what we have to sell. It's an incredibly homogeneous portfolio put on at one price level essentially. So, the math doesn't work any other way than when you sell those longer-duration securities with the loss of, call it, 15% to 18% depending on the individual bonds. You're not going to be able to achieve, for example, a three-year payback. The math just is impossible. So, your calculation is correct. Gregory Zingone -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst OK. Thank you. And then the last question I have for you on those two Eastern investor office loans. Could you share with us the loan size of each current occupancy and if there are any specific reserves against these credits at quarter-end? David Rosato -- Chief Financial Officer We'll share some of that information. This is legacy Eastern loans that were essentially long time -- we've been ahead of these loans for a long time. They had high level of specific reserves, and there's really nothing more that needs to be said about them. They were identified, reserved for charged-off. Gregory Zingone -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst OK. Thank you. David Rosato -- Chief Financial Officer You're welcome, Greg. Operator Your next question comes from Damon DelMonte with KBW. Your line is now open. Damon Delmonte -- Analyst Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Hope everybody is doing well today. So, first question on the margin as we try to model this out on a quarterly basis going forward, David. Since this is taking place -- the restructuring is taking place here, midway through the first quarter, do you expect to kind of split the benefit from the restructuring on the margin in the first quarter? So, maybe 9 basis points of benefit here in the first quarter and then get the full run rate going into the second quarter? Is that a good way to look at it? David Rosato -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I mean, we're specifically using mid first quarter. So, take it literally. It's a lot of securities. And the selling is easier than the buying, right? We want to make sure we're looking for or repurchasing the security structure we want. So, we're announcing it today. Our board recently approved the transaction. We're starting to execute on it. We're giving ourselves a couple of weeks to complete execution. So, yes. So, the first half January and half of February will run a lower-margin impact than the back half of the quarter. Damon Delmonte -- Analyst Got it. OK. And then the guidance for the full year of 3.45 to 3.55, how should we think about kind of an exiting margin in the fourth quarter? David Rosato -- Chief Financial Officer Tell me your rate forecast, right? That's a big driver. I think the more important issue there, Damon, so 3.45 to 3.55, it's -- and we're also calling out two parallel changes in the yield curve were basically interest rate-neutral. The yield curve is steepening and it's basically upward sloping. That's why we called out the benefit to 25 basis points on the short end. That $7 million, just as a reminder, is annualized, not 2025. Depends on when that might -- if and when that might happen. The -- over the course of the quarters, there's -- with no change in rates, there is incremental improvement as the year goes on. That has to do with forgetting the first quarter and the timing of the securities repositioning, right, halfway through. It has to do with, in Q1 and Q2, 80% of our CD book is going to roll and it's going to reprice lower. So, that's number one. Number two is the -- we called out the hedges that are starting to come off, right? That starts in July. So, that's more of a back half issue. And then just the core business of the bank with no change in rates, and that growth of money markets and DDA accounts relative to our loan growth, modest as it is, creates a little bit more positive margins. Damon Delmonte -- Analyst Got it. OK. That's helpful. Thank you. And then this is kind of like -- two thoughts here. Number one, as you look at the deal that was announced in December between Brookline and Berkshire Hills and potential market disruption and opportunities to take some market share there, and you look at your loan growth outlook of 2% to 4%. I mean, do you think that there's opportunities from the disruption that could lead to the higher end of the growth outlook? Or do you just feel that the underlying conditions would only support a 2% to 4% type of loan growth for the year? David Rosato -- Chief Financial Officer So, we are hopeful that we'll be able to capitalize on market disruption. There was the transaction you just referenced in our market. And then there was an earlier transaction that's more in the Northern part of our market. The -- so -- but that opportunity, as hopeful as we are, is not embedded in the 2% to 4% guide. So, we would hope that there's incremental benefit over the course of the year, but we're not including it in our outlook. Damon Delmonte -- Analyst Got it. OK, great. Appreciate that. That's all that I have for now. Thank you very much. David Rosato -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Damon. Operator [Operator instructions] Your next question comes from Laurie Hunsicker with Seaport Research Partners. Your line is now open. Laurie Hunsicker -- Analyst Yeah. Hi, Bob, Denis, and David. Good morning. Just going back to the margin, can you share with us, David, where the spot margin was for December? David Rosato -- Chief Financial Officer Sure, Laurie. Good morning. So, the spot margin in December was 3.13. You can write that number down. But I would tell you a better number to work off of is probably 3.08. We just had -- there was one -- there was a little extra accretion income in the month that drove the margin up a touch. Normalized, I'd call it a 3.08. Laurie Hunsicker -- Analyst OK, great. And then you mentioned the buybacks that you had done, and I just didn't actually get the share count since the quarter-end. What was that number? David Rosato -- Chief Financial Officer So, we called out the -- we called out ending share count of -- hold on, $202.1 million. And then I'm not sure if you caught it, but we also wanted to share what we've done this quarter to date. So, in this quarter, we bought 761,000 shares. Laurie Hunsicker -- Analyst Yep. OK. Got it. Yeah, that was your -- I thought you -- sorry, I missed it. I thought you had called out what you had done in January. OK. And then just going back over -- David Rosato -- Chief Financial Officer Hey, Laurie. That 761,000 is what we did in January. Laurie Hunsicker -- Analyst Is what you did, OK. OK. Got it. David Rosato -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Yeah. Denis Sheahan -- Chief Executive Officer When we said Q4, say Q4 then January. David Rosato -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Just to be clear, we bought 908,000 in Q4. And we additionally bought 761,000 in January. Laurie Hunsicker -- Analyst Great. That's 13.1. OK. Great. Thank you. OK. And then just going back over to office. And I really appreciate all the extra details that you put in Slide 13. I love how you've laid it out, super helpful. Just a couple of things. So, the charge-offs that you had, just the commercial real estate charge-offs of 31 million, how much of that was actually office this quarter? David Rosato -- Chief Financial Officer It's -- yeah. Essentially, all of it. The non-office was just under $1 million. Laurie Hunsicker -- Analyst OK. And then can you share with us a little bit about the office charges? In other words, those are some big haircuts, which certainly is not different than what we've seen other banks taking. But just to have some data points, do you have any details that you can share? Denis Sheahan -- Chief Executive Officer I mean, I think, Laurie, that's the -- I think that's the answer to the question. It's not much different than others are experiencing. It's just -- it's the nature of the market. It's -- when you're assessing these properties, you're looking at ultimately one's ability to exit. And so, we're making significant haircuts on them that we think is appropriate. Laurie Hunsicker -- Analyst OK. Just didn't know if you had anything to share. OK, the 184 million that you have that is listed as office criticized and classified, how much of that is coming due in 2025? Denis Sheahan -- Chief Executive Officer So, we've laid out the maturity. I don't -- we don't have that number in front of us, Laurie. We can perhaps put that in the future presentation. But we've laid out the maturity of the nonperforming loans here over 2025 that you see on Slide 13. Laurie Hunsicker -- Analyst Right. Yeah, I see that. So, just 3 million. But I just didn't know if anything was potentially going to be stressed. In other words, when you look to, for example, 2Q, the 67 million that's all accruing, are the vacancy rates there at the accruing properties running where you want them to be? Or how do you think about that? Denis Sheahan -- Chief Executive Officer Well, if they -- if they were stressed, we'd be looking at possibly placing those loans on nonaccrual. So, our team, as you know, as we referenced before, does a very thorough review of our investor office portfolio on a constant basis. And as of year-end, we felt it was appropriate to keep -- those loans that are maturing to keep them accruing. If there was a stress point there, we would be looking to put them on nonaccrual. David Rosato -- Chief Financial Officer Just a little more color. So, if you look at Q1, right, there's three loans maturing on that page. One is a nonaccrual. It will be -- it's completely reserved for, it will be resolved this quarter or next. All the other loans are accruing. No concerns on our part. If you look at the second quarter, every one of those loans is accruing. We don't think there's an issue at all on any of those loans. Laurie Hunsicker -- Analyst Perfect. Perfect. Super helpful. OK. And then just going over to your merger charges, the one-time charges with CATC. Are those now wrapped? Or can you just remind us what we should expect there? David Rosato -- Chief Financial Officer It's a wrap, yeah. So, we're through Cambridge. Yes, we're through Cambridge merger charges. And it was only $3.5 million in the quarter, in Q4. Laurie Hunsicker -- Analyst Yep, perfect. OK. Great. OK. And then last question, Denis and Bob. As you're talking about two significant mergers in the fourth quarter, obviously, right in your market, the Brookline-Berkshire Hills that was referenced, the INDB acquisition that they did, I guess your tone a little bit. I just want to understand this. I realize you're focused on organic growth. However -- you said, however, right? So, help us think a little bit about suddenly now, two banks have jumped in there, exactly your same size. Does that put pressure on you? Like maybe just expand a little bit on the however, how you're looking at that? And if you were to see a deal, what's the sweet spot acquisition-wise where it would make sense for you to really take a look at that? Thanks. Denis Sheahan -- Chief Executive Officer So, no. We don't feel pressure. Our focus is on maximizing the benefit of the recent combinations that we've entered into, both the Cambridge Trust merger, the Century Bank merger. Those are both very important, you know, opportunities for us to capitalize on, and we've got a lot of work to do there. So, we don't feel pressure to engage in mergers. However, and this is the however, from time to time, organizations decide that they want to sell. And we're confident that if they did decide to sell, that we'd like -- we'd get a call. And we'd consider that in a disciplined manner, whether or not we would want to engage. So, it's just -- it's a consolidating market, as you know, Laurie. We have a capability. We have a skill set. We have an attractive currency and attractive organization to partner with. So, I put it in that characterization rather than saying that we sort of feel any pressure to do mergers. Laurie Hunsicker -- Analyst OK. And then just one last question. How small is too small? How big would you consider going as you sort of think about that band? Thanks. Denis Sheahan -- Chief Executive Officer So, we never want to rule out anything. It depends on the opportunity and the financial circumstances of a particular opportunity. I mean, clearly, the effort that's required, whether it's a $1 billion bank or a $5 billion bank or a $10 billion bank, is generally the same. So, you have to weigh that very carefully. But as you know, when you think about our organization, there may be -- even with a smaller institution, there may be holes that we may want to fill. That's how we might think about it. But you have to weigh that against the effort, the distraction, etc., that happens, whether it's a $1 billion bank or a $10 billion bank. So, I'm not going to rule out anything. Laurie Hunsicker -- Analyst OK, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Denis Sheahan -- Chief Executive Officer Sure. You're welcome. Operator There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to management for closing remarks. Bob Rivers -- Executive Chair Great. Well, thank you, again, for your interest in Eastern and for your questions this morning. We look forward to talking with you again in the spring.

Release Date: January 24, 2025 For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript . Positive Points Eastern Bankshares Inc ( NASDAQ:EBC ) reported a full-year operating net income of $192.6 million, an 18% increase from 2023. The merger with Cambridge Trust solidified EBC's position as the largest commercial bank headquartered in Greater Boston. Net interest income increased by 10% from 2023, with a 12 basis points expansion in the net interest margin. EBC's liquidity position remains strong with a 21% year-over-year increase in period-end deposits and no wholesale funding. The company successfully repurchased $28.4 million worth of shares and increased the dividend by 9%. Negative Points Charge-offs were elevated in the quarter at 71 basis points, primarily from PCD loans acquired from Cambridge. The company faces potential headwinds from the overall economic and rate environment, which could impact growth. There were significant credit marks taken through merger accounting, impacting financial performance. The investor office loan portfolio remains a primary focus due to ongoing credit cycle challenges. The earn-back period for the investment portfolio repositioning is longer than typical, at approximately 5.7 years. Story Continues Q & A Highlights Q : Could you share the average rate of the securities you were selling as part of the repositioning and the average rate and duration of the securities you were buying? A : The average portfolio yield was about 1.82% to 1.84%. The securities being purchased have an average yield of about 4.75%, ranging up to just under 5%. These include a mix of agency securities, CMBS, and agency mortgage-backed securities. Q : On the two Eastern investor office loans, could you share the loan size, current occupancy, and if there are any specific reserves against these credits at quarter end? A : These are legacy Eastern loans with high levels of specific reserves. They have been identified, reserved for, and charged-off, with no further details necessary. Q : How should we model the margin benefit from the restructuring on a quarterly basis? A : The restructuring is taking place mid-first quarter, so the first half of January and half of February will have a lower margin impact than the back half of the quarter. The full benefit will be realized in the second quarter. Q : Regarding the loan growth outlook of 2% to 4%, do you think market disruptions could lead to higher growth? A : While we are hopeful to capitalize on market disruptions, such opportunities are not embedded in the 2% to 4% guidance. We would hope for incremental benefits over the year, but they are not included in our current outlook. Q : Can you provide details on the office charge-offs and the $184 million in office criticized and classified loans? A : Essentially all of the $31 million in commercial real estate charge-offs were office-related. The criticized and classified loans are reviewed thoroughly, and those maturing in 2025 are currently accruing, indicating no immediate stress.

The Company\u2019s fourth quarter results reflect the first full quarter impact of the merger with Cambridge Bancorp (\"Cambridge\") (\"the merger\"). The Company\u2019s third quarter financial results included a partial quarter impact of the merger, which closed on July 12, 2024. Story Continues \"As we close out the fourth quarter and reflect on another successful year, our most significant milestone was the merger with Cambridge Trust,\" said Bob Rivers, Executive Chair and Chair of the Board of Directors of the Company and Eastern Bank. \"This combination not only solidifies our position as a leading financial institution in our region but also allows us to deliver a broader suite of offerings to our customers, greater opportunities for our colleagues, and even stronger commitment to our communities.\" Denis Sheahan, Chief Executive Officer, added, \"We remain focused on continuing to capitalize on merger synergies, long-term growth opportunities, and our overall financial performance. After meeting or exceeding our merger related financial targets, we posted full year operating net income of $192.6 million, 18% higher than 2023. We are well positioned to continue to deepen and expand customer relationships in our retail, commercial and wealth divisions as we continue to leverage our market presence in and around Boston.\" \"Our fourth quarter financial results were very positive,\" said David Rosato, Chief Financial Officer. \"Our margin expanded by 8 basis points, supported by a reduction in deposit costs. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with exceptional levels of liquidity, capital, and credit reserves. In early 2025, we are in the process of repositioning our investment portfolio which will accelerate improvement in our financial performance, adding approximately 18 basis points to the margin and $0.13 to operating earnings per share in 2025. Our CET1 capital ratio will decline by less than one percent, and we expect to rebuild approximately half of that capital position by the end of 2025 through stronger earnings.\" BALANCE SHEET Total assets were $25.6 billion at December 31, 2024, an increase of $50.7 million, or 0.2% from September 30, 2024. Cash and equivalents increased $117.4 million to $1.0 billion. Securities decreased $148.5 million, or 3.2%, to $4.4 billion, due to a decline in the market value of available for sale securities (\"AFS securities\") driven by higher interest rates, sale of $116 million in AFS securities, and principal runoff, partially offset by the purchase of $200 million in AFS securities. Loans totaled $18.1 billion, an increase of $15.0 million. Deposits totaled $21.3 billion, an increase of $74.8 million, primarily driven by growth in business checking deposits, as well as a seasonal growth in municipal deposits, partially offset by a decrease in time deposits. Shareholders\u2019 equity was $3.6 billion, a decrease of $59.2 million, due primarily to decreases in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by an increase in retained earnings. Book value per share and tangible book value per share* ended the quarter at $16.89 and $11.98, respectively. Please refer to Appendix D for a roll-forward of tangible shareholders\u2019 equity*. NET INTEREST INCOME Net interest income was $179.2 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of $9.3 million, due to an increase in the net interest margin and average earning assets. The net interest margin on a FTE basis* was 3.05%, an 8 basis point increase, as funding costs declined faster than asset yields. The yield on total interest-earning assets decreased 4 basis points from the prior quarter to 4.56%, due primarily to decreases in loan yields of 8 basis points and average securities volume, partially offset by higher short-term investments volume. Total interest-bearing liabilities cost decreased 17 basis points to 2.33%, due primarily to deposit pricing decreases. Net interest income included net discount accretion of $12.9 million from purchase accounting adjustments in connection with the Cambridge merger, compared to $10.8 million in the prior quarter. NONINTEREST INCOME Noninterest income was $37.3 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of $3.8 million. Operating noninterest income* was $36.9 million, an increase of $4.0 million. Trust and investment advisory fees increased $3.1 million to $18.0 million, which included a one-time item of $1.2 million. Service charges on deposit accounts increased $0.3 million to $8.4 million. Customer swap income increased $0.6 million to $1.2 million, driven primarily by higher transaction volume. Non-operating income from investments held in rabbi trust accounts were less than $0.1 million, compared to $3.6 million in the prior quarter due to investment performance. Non-operating losses on sales of AFS securities were $9.2 million due to the sale of approximately $116 million of AFS securities. There were no losses on sales of AFS securities in the prior quarter. Other noninterest income increased $12.8 million to $15.8 million, due primarily to the non-operating gain of $9.3 million from the sale of an equity investment. The prior quarter included a non-operating loss on merger-related disposal of fixed assets totaling $3.0 million. NONINTEREST EXPENSE Noninterest expense was $137.5 million, a decrease of $22.2 million. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in merger-related expenses of $24.0 million. Operating noninterest expense* was $133.7 million, an increase of $2.9 million. Salaries and employee benefits expense was $78.9 million, a decrease of $14.9 million, due primarily to a decrease in merger-related expenses of $12.0 million, as well as decreases in operating incentive compensation costs of $1.4 million, operating federal payroll tax expense of $0.7 million, and non-operating rabbi trust employee benefit expense of $1.1 million. Occupancy and equipment expense was $12.8 million, a decrease of $1.7 million, due primarily to a reduction in merger-related expenses. Data processing expense was $21.4 million, an increase of $1.9 million. Professional services expense was $3.3 million, a decrease of $5.7 million, due primarily to a reduction in merger-related expenses of $5.4 million. Marketing expense was $2.8 million, an increase of $1.2 million. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance expense was $3.9 million, an increase of $0.7 million. Amortization of intangible assets was $7.4 million, an increase of $1.1 million. Other noninterest expense was $7.1 million, a decrease of $4.9 million, due primarily to decreases in provision for off balance sheet credit exposures of $1.4 million, and merger-related costs. Please refer to Appendix E for additional detail on merger charges*. ASSET QUALITY Non-performing loans totaled $135.8 million, or 0.76% of total loans, at December 31, 2024 compared to $124.5 million, or 0.70% of total loans, at the end of the prior quarter. The increase was driven primarily by commercial real estate office loans, partially offset by charge-off activity. During the fourth quarter 2024, the Company recorded total net charge-offs of $31.7 million, or 0.71% of average total loans, compared to $5.1 million, or 0.12% in the prior quarter. The increase in total net charge-offs was due primarily to partial charge-offs of the purchased credit deteriorated (\"PCD\") loans acquired from Cambridge. The Company recorded a provision for loan losses totaling $6.8 million in the quarter. The allowance for loan losses was $229.0 million at December 31, 2024, or 1.29% of total loans, compared to $253.8 million, or 1.43% of total loans, at September 30, 2024. 2025 INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO REPOSITIONING The Company announced an investment portfolio repositioning was underway in 2025 whereby approximately $1.2 billion of low yielding available-for-sale securities would be sold and reinvested at current market rates. The transaction is expected to be completed by the middle of the first quarter of 2025, and result in an after-tax non-operating loss of approximately $200 million. The after-tax losses are already reflected in shareholders\u2019 equity. DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES The Company\u2019s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per common share. The dividend will be payable on March 14, 2025 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 3, 2025. The Company repurchased 908,425 shares of common stock during the fourth quarter at a weighted average price of $17.41, for an aggregate purchase price of $15.8 million.

A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of the Company\u2019s historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding (or including) amounts that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") in the Company\u2019s statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows (or equivalent statements). The Company presents non-GAAP financial measures, which management uses to evaluate the Company\u2019s performance, and which exclude the effects of certain transactions that management believes are unrelated to its core business and are therefore not necessarily indicative of its current performance or financial position. Management believes excluding these items facilitates greater visibility for investors into the Company\u2019s core business as well as underlying trends that may, to some extent, be obscured by inclusion of such items in the corresponding GAAP financial measures. Except as otherwise indicated, these non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release exclude discontinued operations. There are items in the Company\u2019s financial statements that impact its financial results, but which management believes are unrelated to the Company\u2019s core business. Accordingly, the Company presents noninterest income on an operating basis, total operating revenue, noninterest expense on an operating basis, operating net income, operating earnings per share, operating return on average assets, operating return on average shareholders\u2019 equity, operating return on average tangible shareholders\u2019 equity (discussed further below), and the operating efficiency ratio. Each of these figures excludes the impact of such applicable items because management believes such exclusion can provide greater visibility into the Company\u2019s core business and underlying trends. Such items that management does not consider to be core to the Company\u2019s business include (i) income and expenses from investments held in rabbi trusts, (ii) gains and losses on sales of securities available for sale, net, (iii) gains and losses on the sale of other assets, (iv) rabbi trust employee benefits, (v) impairment charges on tax credit investments and associated tax credit benefits, (vi) other real estate owned (\"OREO\") gains, (vii) merger and acquisition expenses, including the \"day-2\" provision for allowance for loan losses for non-PCD acquired loans, (viii) the non-cash pension settlement charge recognized related to the defined benefit plan, (ix) certain discrete tax items, and (x) net income from discontinued operations. Return on average tangible shareholders\u2019 equity, operating return on average tangible shareholders\u2019 equity as well as the operating efficiency ratio also further exclude the effect of amortization of intangible assets. The Company does not provide an outlook for its total noninterest income and total noninterest expense because each contains income or expense components, as applicable, such as income associated with rabbi trust accounts and rabbi trust employee benefit expense, which are market-driven, and over which the Company cannot exercise control. Accordingly, reconciliations of the Company\u2019s outlook for its noninterest income on an operating basis and its noninterest expense on an operating basis to an outlook for total noninterest income and total noninterest expense are not provided. Management also presents tangible assets, tangible shareholders\u2019 equity, average tangible shareholders\u2019 equity, tangible book value per share, the ratio of tangible shareholders\u2019 equity to tangible assets, return on average tangible shareholders\u2019 equity, and operating return on average shareholders\u2019 equity (discussed further above), each of which excludes the impact of goodwill and other intangible assets and in the case of tangible net income (loss), return on average tangible shareholders\u2019 equity and operating return on average tangible shareholders\u2019 equity excludes the after-tax impact of amortization of intangible assets, as management believes these financial measures provide investors with the ability to further assess the Company\u2019s performance, identify trends in its core business and provide a comparison of its capital adequacy to other companies. The Company includes the tangible ratios because management believes that investors may find it useful to have access to the same analytical tools used by management to assess performance and identify trends. In the third quarter of 2024, we changed our (loss) return on average tangible shareholders' equity and operating return on average tangible shareholders\u2019 equity computations to utilize tangible net (loss) income from continuing operations and tangible operating net income, respectively, in the numerators of the computations. Tangible net (loss) income from continuing operations excludes the amortization of intangible assets and the related tax effect and tangible operating net income excludes, in addition to the adjustments to derive operating net income, the amortization of intangible assets and related tax effect. In addition, in the third quarter of 2024, we changed the computation of our operating efficiency ratio to exclude, in addition to the adjustments made to operating net income, the amortization of intangible assets. Management believes the changes to such ratios result in a more meaningful measure of our financial performance and such measures are used by management when analyzing corporate performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release should not be considered an alternative or substitute for financial results or measures determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indication of the Company\u2019s cash flows from operating activities, a measure of its liquidity position or an indication of funds available for its cash needs. An item which management considers to be non-core and excludes when computing these non-GAAP measures can be of substantial importance to the Company\u2019s results for any particular period. In addition, management\u2019s methodology for calculating non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the methodologies employed by other banking companies to calculate the same or similar performance measures, and accordingly, the Company\u2019s reported non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to the same or similar performance measures reported by other banking companies. Please refer to Appendices A-E for reconciliations of the Company's GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures in this press release.

Certain factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results include; adverse developments in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and charge-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses; increased competitive pressures; changes in interest rates and resulting changes in competitor or customer behavior, mix or costs of sources of funding, and deposit amounts and composition; risks associated with the Company\u2019s implementation of the merger, including that revenue or expense synergies may not fully materialize for the Company in the timeframe expected or at all, or may be more costly to achieve; that Eastern\u2019s business may not perform as expected in the years following the merger; that Eastern\u2019s expansion of services or capabilities resulting from the merger may be more challenging than anticipated; and disruptions arising from transitions in management personnel; adverse national or regional economic conditions or conditions within the securities markets or banking sector; legislative and regulatory changes and related compliance costs that could adversely affect the business in which the Company and its subsidiaries, including Eastern Bank, are engaged, including the effect of, and changes in, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, such as the interest rate policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; market and monetary fluctuations, including inflationary or recessionary pressures, interest rate sensitivity, liquidity constraints, increased borrowing and funding costs, and fluctuations due to actual or anticipated changes to federal tax laws; the realizability of deferred tax assets; the Company\u2019s ability to successfully implement its risk mitigation strategies; asset and credit quality deterioration, including adverse developments in local or regional real estate markets that decrease collateral values associated with existing loans; operational risks such as cybersecurity incidents, natural disasters, and pandemics and the failure of the Company to execute its planned share repurchases. For further discussion of such factors, please see the Company\u2019s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), which are available on the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov .

average goodwill and other intangibles, and average tangible shareholders' equity components for the three months and twelve months ended Dec 31, 2023 presented in this section include discontinued operations. (2) The net tax benefit (expense) associated with these items is generally determined by assessing whether each item is included or excluded from net taxable income and applying our combined statutory tax rate only to those items included in net taxable income. Included in the net tax benefit for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2024 is $2.6MM and a $7.4MM, respectively, of lost state tax benefit relating to Massachusetts net operating tax losses prohibited from carryover under Massachusetts tax law. The net operating tax loss position of the Company at December 31, 2024 is primarily a result of tax losses from the 2024 Cambridge's investment portfolio sale. Additionally, as federal net operating tax loss carryovers from 2024 lower projections of 2025 taxable income, the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2024 adjustments include a $2.8MM valuation allowance against the Company\u2019s federal charitable contribution carryforward deferred tax asset that is set to expire at the end of 2025. The net tax benefit for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the tax benefit from state tax strategies associated with the utilization of capital losses as a result of the sale of securities in the first quarter of 2023. Upon the sale of securities in the first quarter of 2023, we established a valuation allowance of $17.4 million, as it was determined at that time that it was not more-likely-than-not that the entirety of the deferred tax asset related to the loss on such securities would be realized. Included in that $17.4 million was $2.8 million in expected lost state tax benefits. Following the execution of the sale of our insurance agency business in October 2023 and the resulting capital gain, coupled with tax planning strategies, a state tax benefit of $13.6 million was realized on the securities sale losses. (3) Metrics for the three months presented on an annualized basis. (4) The tax effect of amortization of intangible assets is calculated using the Company's combined statutory tax rate of 28.23% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company anticipated a combined statutory rate of 27.7% for the year as reflected in the tax effect of amortization of intangible assets for the corresponding three-month periods in 2024. (5) The tangible net income (loss), return on average tangible shareholders' equity ratio and operating return on average tangible shareholders' equity ratio exclude the amortization of intangible assets, net of tax.

Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 2:10 AM 3 min read SmarFinancial (SMBK) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.57 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.54 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.41 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5.56%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this bank holding company would post earnings of $0.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.54, delivering a surprise of 10.20%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times. SmarFinancial , which belongs to the Zacks Banks - Northeast industry, posted revenues of $46.81 million for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.93%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $39.1 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. SmarFinancial shares have added about 1.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2%. What's Next for SmarFinancial? While SmarFinancial has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for SmarFinancial: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.55 on $45.28 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.40 on $190.29 million in revenues for the current fiscal year. Story Continues Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.
