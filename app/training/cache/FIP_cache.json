[{"text": "With 75% institutional ownership, FTAI Infrastructure Inc. (NASDAQ:FIP) is a favorite amongst the big guns editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 5:40 PM 4 min read In This Article: FIP -3.99% Key Insights Significantly high institutional ownership implies FTAI Infrastructure's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions 52% of the business is held by the top 12 shareholders Ownership research along with analyst forecasts data help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock To get a sense of who is truly in control of FTAI Infrastructure Inc. ( NASDAQ:FIP ), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 75% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait. In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of FTAI Infrastructure. Check out our latest analysis for FTAI Infrastructure NasdaqGS:FIP Ownership Breakdown January 23rd 2025 What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About FTAI Infrastructure? Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in FTAI Infrastructure. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see FTAI Infrastructure's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. NasdaqGS:FIP Earnings and Revenue Growth January 23rd 2025 Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Our data indicates that hedge funds own 5.2% of FTAI Infrastructure. That catches my attention because hedge funds sometimes try to influence management, or bring about changes that will create near term value for shareholders. Our data shows that Washington State Investment Board is the largest shareholder with 10% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.2% of common stock, and Luxor Capital Group, LP holds about 5.2% of the company stock. Furthermore, CEO Kenneth Nicholson is the owner of 0.5% of the company's shares. Story Continues Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 52% of the ownership is controlled by the top 12 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too. Insider Ownership Of FTAI Infrastructure The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our information suggests that FTAI Infrastructure Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It seems the board members have no more than US$7.5m worth of shares in the US$764m company. We generally like to see a board more invested. However it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public Ownership The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 19% stake in FTAI Infrastructure. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. Next Steps: While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

season: \u2018I thought it was a perfect fit\u2019 Abbey Mastracco, New York Daily News Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 2:51 AM 4 min read Last winter, Sean Manaea signed a one-year prove-it contract with the Mets . He proved that he was still capable of fulfilling the promise of becoming a solid front-end rotation option, parlaying a career year into a longer deal with the team that he thrived on last year. The Mets reintroduced the popular left-hander Monday afternoon in a Zoom conference, officially announcing his three-year, $75 million contract. Though he had other teams that reached out to him, since the last day of the season when he fought back tears in the Dodger Stadium visitor\u2019s clubhouse, the reunion with the Mets felt destined. \u201cBased off last year with the coaching staff and everything, I thought it was a perfect fit,\u201d Manea said. \u201cMy wife, she loved it on the family side as well. Just organizationally, I thought they did a lot of great things and I learned a lot from [pitching coach Jeremy Hefner] and the rest of the staff. Just overall, I was very, very happy with my time there, and when [the Mets] reached out and said that they wanted to reunite, I knew that was kind of a top priority.\u201d Manaea, who will be 33 on Feb. 1, went 12-6 with a 3.47 ERA and a 3.83 FIP over 32 starts with the Mets last season. The lefty received Cy Young Award votes for his efforts, finishing 11th in the NL race, finding success with a refined sweeper and a fastball thrown from a lower arm slot. The sweeper was his own addition, something he taught himself after looking at grips on YouTube one night during his time with the San Francisco Giants. Lowering the release point of his fastball was something he worked on with Hefner. Manaea loves nothing more than experimenting with various pitches and grips in the bullpen and in Hefner, he found a coach that supported the experimentation and helped turn some of the tinkering into viable pitches. \u201cHe kind of allowed me to be like myself and kind of experiment with some things,\u201d Manaea said. \u201cJust kind of bouncing ideas off of him, and he\u2019s very easy to talk to as far as pitching and pitch design. All these different things that, you know, have to do with pitching, he just made everything feel super easy.\u201d Manaea also felt at ease immediately in a new market. The Indiana native had spent his entire career in California until last season and his laid-back, yet curious demeanor seemed to be a perfect fit for the West Coast. But in New York, Manaea and his wife enjoyed the vibrant culture in Manhattan and the surrounding boroughs. He found enjoyment in his daily subway commute, listening to music on the 7 train to get geared up for games. Though he has yet to find one of the infamous subway platform chess games, he\u2019s still hoping to join one someday. Story Continues In the clubhouse, his veteran voice was respected. The Mets excelled last season in part because of a clubhouse culture that not only allows players to show their personalities but encourages them to as well. Manaea doesn\u2019t like to take credit as a leader, respecting Francisco Lindor and Brandon Nimmo as unofficial captains, but he encouraged the starting pitching group to support one another late in the season and during the postseason. He started wearing the number of the game\u2019s starter in eye black and dancing with the pitchers in the dugout after they came out of games. The culture was one that allowed him to thrive, factoring heavily into his decision to return to the Mets. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say I\u2019m like the leader or anything like that, I think it\u2019s kind of like a collective,\u201d Manaea said \u201cThat\u2019s kind of like the strength that we had going on. It wasn\u2019t like one singular guy was the leader of the group. I feel like, when it was our start date, that was the day, and you know, just passed the torch onto the next guy. And last year, that\u2019s what happened.\u201d Coming back to the Mets also reunites Manaea with right-hander Frankie Montas, his close friend and former teammate in Oakland. Manaea sees someone who can add to that clubhouse culture. \u201cHe is a funny guy and he\u2019s definitely very passionate about pitching and competitiveness,\u201d Manaea said. \u201cHe just goes out there and is a dog, so I\u2019m looking forward to that. And, I mean, his stuff is incredible too, so he brings all that stuff to the table, and he\u2019s just a great human being and a great friend, so you\u2019ve got that going as well. \u201cI\u2019m just very happy that he\u2019s on our team now.\u201d More than anything Manaea seems to be happy that he can put down roots with his new wife in a place they enjoy with a three-year contract. He\u2019s continuing to work with Driveline at their Florida location and rejoins a group headlined by Kodai Senga and left-hander David Peterson. He\u2019s also worked out with free agent first baseman Pete Alonso and would like to see the Polar Bear return to Queens as well. The starting rotation is set, and with Manaea, the culture is too.

LAPD hasn't linked LA fires to MAGA, cause of blaze unknown | Fact check Hannah Hudnall, USA TODAY Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 12:09 AM 4 min read The claim: LAPD sought three 'persons of interest' in fires tied to MAGA website A Jan. 8 Threads post ( direct link , archive link ) claims Los Angeles authorities linked the California wildfires to three supporters of President-elect Donald Trump. \"Apparently LAPD are looking for three 'persons of interest,' all tied to a MAGA website and who were spotted at the source of all three major LA fires,\" the post reads. \"This might have been the opening salvo in Trump\u2019s war against any State he considers an 'enemy within.'\" The post was shared more than 200 times in four days. Fact-check roundup: Which claims about LA fires are true or false? The latest fact-check roundup More from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook page Our rating: False The Los Angeles Police Department hasn't made any statements about \"persons of interest\" related to a MAGA website. The Los Angeles Fire Department said it is still investigating the cause of the fires as of Jan. 13. Supposed link between fires and MAGA supporters is baseless A set of deadly wildfires continues to rage across Los Angeles County , with the Palisades Fire ranking as the most destructive in the county's history. The fires destroyed more than 12,000 businesses, houses and other structures , displaced nearly 180,000 residents and killed at least 24 people as of Jan. 13.But neither the LAPD nor the Los Angeles Fire Department have linked the fires to any \"persons of interest\" related to a MAGA website. Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone and Chief Deputy of Emergency Operations Jon O'Brien said in Jan. 8 and 9 press conferences the cause of the fires is unknown and still under investigation. O'Brien said the department would announce the cause as soon as it is determined. The LAPD did arrest a man Jan. 9 after he was seen trying to start a fire in an area that was burning in the Kenneth fire, the Los Angeles Times reported. The man was arrested on suspicion of a probation violation, but a Ventura County Sheriff's Department spokesperson said the man is a \"person of interest\" in the fire, which began near the Ventura and Los Angeles county line, the newspaper reported. That fire was 100% contained as of Jan. 12. There was no indication the man had any ties to a MAGA website. The arrest happened after the Threads post was published. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection lists the causes of the fires as \"under investigation\" on its website . Fact check : Was Hollywood Sign surrounded by fire? No, this image is fabricated The LA branch of the National Weather Service issued a red flag warning on Jan. 6, one day before the initial fires broke out. The warning forecasted \"extreme fire behavior\" for the next three days caused by the area's dry conditions and strong winds. Accuweather reported that Los Angeles hadn't experienced a quarter inch of rain since April 2024. About 84% of Los Angeles County was\u00a0experiencing a drought\u00a0prior to the fires, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor . USA TODAY reported the fires were fueled by the Santa Ana winds , which occur most often in the fall and winter and push dry air from the California and the Southwest deserts toward the coast. Janice Coen , a project scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, said the winds dry out vegetation on the mountain ridges and can carry embers long distances. USA TODAY reached out to the user who shared the post for comment but did not immediately receive a response. PolitiFact also debunked the claim.

13, 2025, 5:28 PM 2 min read After a break in strong winds that helped firefighters make progress against the deadly blazes in Southern California , gusty Santa Ana winds are returning to the region this week, raising the threat of more destruction as humidity levels remain low and dry conditions persist. High winds and red flag advisories warning of \"a particularly dangerous situation\" were set to activate Monday night and last through at least Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service . Winds in Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties could reach between 55 and 70 mph, with some stronger gusts at higher elevations. \"If fire ignition occurs, conditions are favorable for very rapid fire spread and extreme fire behavior, including long range spotting, which would threaten life and property,\" a critical red flag warning from the weather service office in Los Angeles said . More: Winds poised to intensify, complicating LA wildfire battle: Live updates AccuWeather said it expects some winds gusts to possibly reach 100 mph in the mountains as they did last week, which led to the explosive wildfire growth that has torched entire neighborhoods and forced tens of thousands to flee their homes. The strongest winds \u2013 possibly reaching hurricane speeds \u2013 are expected to last between Tuesday and Wednesday morning, forecasters said. Get weather and fire alerts via text: Sign up to get current wildfire updates by location Drought conditions remain in Southern California Humidity levels are expected to remain low \u2013 around 10% to 20% \u2013 providing little moisture to the region as parched vegetation continues to fuel the blazes, the weather service said. Additionally, no rain is expected to alleviate drought conditions in Southern California this week. \"Dating back to April of last year, Los Angeles has not yet crested the 1-inch mark for rainfall. This is a period when downtown L.A. typically receives between 5-6 inches of rain,\" said Alex Sosnowski , a senior meteorologist for AccuWeather, in an online forecast. Firefighters look for hotspots at a burn down home due to the Palisades Fire, along Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California, U.S., Jan. 12, 2025. Just about all of Southern California, including Los Angeles and Ventura counties, is experiencing moderate to severe drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor . AccuWeather forecasters said they are monitoring a chance winds surge again in the midweek, with a change in wind direction possibly bringing \"slightly higher moisture levels.\" \"The wind could subside from late Tuesday into Wednesday [across Southern California]. However, the wind could change direction and increase again midweek, this time onshore. This should increase humidity levels some,\" said AccuWeather meteorologist Paul Pastelok.

-3.99% Two Reasons to Like FIP and One to Stay Skeptical Over the last six months, FTAI Infrastructure\u2019s shares have sunk to $8.21, producing a disappointing 10.3% loss - a stark contrast to the S&P 500\u2019s 4.7% gain. This was partly due to its softer quarterly results and may have investors wondering how to approach the situation. Given the weaker price action, is now a good time to buy FIP? Find out in our full research report, it\u2019s free . Why Does FIP Stock Spark Debate? Spun off from FTAI Aviation in 2021, FTAI Infrastructure (NASDAQ:FIP) invests in and operates infrastructure and related assets across the transportation and energy sectors. Two Positive Attributes: 1. Skyrocketing Revenue Shows Strong Momentum Reviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Thankfully, FTAI Infrastructure\u2019s 51.1% annualized revenue growth over the last three years was incredible. Its growth surpassed the average industrials company and shows its offerings resonate with customers. FTAI Infrastructure Quarterly Revenue 2. Projected Revenue Growth Is Remarkable Forecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company\u2019s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite, though some deceleration is natural as businesses become larger. Over the next 12 months, sell-side analysts expect FTAI Infrastructure\u2019s revenue to rise by 31.1%, an improvement versus its 18.1% annualized growth for the past two years. This projection is eye-popping and suggests its newer products and services will catalyze better top-line performance. One Reason to be Careful: Cash Burn Ignites Concerns Free cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king. FTAI Infrastructure\u2019s demanding reinvestments have drained its resources over the last four years, putting it in a pinch and limiting its ability to return capital to investors. Its free cash flow margin averaged negative 65%, meaning it lit $65.02 of cash on fire for every $100 in revenue. FTAI Infrastructure Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin Final Judgment FTAI Infrastructure has huge potential even though it has some open questions. After the recent drawdown, the stock trades at 4.2\u00d7 forward EV-to-EBITDA (or $8.21 per share). Is now the time to initiate a position? See for yourself in our full research report, it\u2019s free . Stocks We Like Even More Than FTAI Infrastructure The elections are now behind us. With rates dropping and inflation cooling, many analysts expect a breakout market to cap off the year - and we\u2019re zeroing in on the stocks that could benefit immensely.

Cautious Adam Hejl Thu, Jan 9, 2025, 12:05 PM 3 min read In This Article: FIP -3.99% Two Reasons to Watch FIP and One to Stay Cautious Over the past six months, FTAI Infrastructure\u2019s stock price fell to $8.21. Shareholders have lost 12.6% of their capital, which is disappointing considering the S&P 500 has climbed by 6.1%. This was partly due to its softer quarterly results and may have investors wondering how to approach the situation. Following the pullback, is now a good time to buy FIP? Find out in our full research report, it\u2019s free . Why Does FIP Stock Spark Debate? Spun off from FTAI Aviation in 2021, FTAI Infrastructure (NASDAQ:FIP) invests in and operates infrastructure and related assets across the transportation and energy sectors. Two Things to Like: 1. Skyrocketing Revenue Shows Strong Momentum A company\u2019s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Over the last three years, FTAI Infrastructure grew its sales at an incredible 51.1% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth beat the average industrials company and shows its offerings resonate with customers. FTAI Infrastructure Quarterly Revenue 2. Projected Revenue Growth Is Remarkable Forecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company\u2019s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite, though some deceleration is natural as businesses become larger. Over the next 12 months, sell-side analysts expect FTAI Infrastructure\u2019s revenue to rise by 31.1%, an improvement versus its 18.1% annualized growth for the past two years. This projection is eye-popping and indicates its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance. One Reason to be Careful: Cash Burn Ignites Concerns Free cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king. FTAI Infrastructure\u2019s demanding reinvestments have drained its resources over the last four years, putting it in a pinch and limiting its ability to return capital to investors. Its free cash flow margin averaged negative 65%, meaning it lit $65.02 of cash on fire for every $100 in revenue. FTAI Infrastructure Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin Final Judgment FTAI Infrastructure has huge potential even though it has some open questions. After the recent drawdown, the stock trades at 4.2\u00d7 forward EV-to-EBITDA (or $8.21 per share). Is now the time to initiate a position? See for yourself in our comprehensive research report, it\u2019s free . Stocks We Like Even More Than FTAI Infrastructure The Trump trade may have passed, but rates are still dropping and inflation is still cooling. Opportunities are ripe for those ready to act - and we\u2019re here to help you pick them. Story Continues Get started by checking out our Top 9 Market-Beating Stocks .
