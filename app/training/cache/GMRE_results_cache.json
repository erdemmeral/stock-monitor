Zacks Equity Research Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 1:55 AM 3 min read In This Article: GMRE +0.38% Global Medical REIT (GMRE) came out with quarterly funds from operations (FFO) of $0.22 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.23 per share. This compares to FFO of $0.23 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of -4.35%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this real estate investment trust would post FFO of $0.22 per share when it actually produced FFO of $0.22, delivering no surprise. Over the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus FFO estimates. Global Medical REIT , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry, posted revenues of $34.26 million for the quarter ended September 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.77%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $35.51 million. The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Global Medical REIT shares have lost about 16.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 21.2%. What's Next for Global Medical REIT? While Global Medical REIT has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Global Medical REIT: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $0.23 on $35.65 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.92 on $139.89 million in revenues for the current fiscal year. Story Continues Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, REIT and Equity Trust - Other is currently in the top 24% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Jeffrey M. Busch, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President stated, \"During the third quarter, we continued to deliver steady results while actively engaging in the transaction market to accretively grow our high-quality portfolio. I\u2019m pleased that in October we completed the acquisition of the remaining 10 properties in the previously announced 15-property portfolio of outpatient medical real estate for an aggregate purchase price of $49.5 million. In total, this 15-property portfolio had an aggregate purchase price of $80.3 million with 254,220 leasable square feet and annualized base rent of $6.4 million. Also, on October 29, 2024, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire a $70 million, five-property portfolio of outpatient medical real estate at a cap rate of 9.0%. With ample liquidity, we remain well positioned in the market to continue to pursue additional opportunities that align with our target assets and return criteria. I would like to thank the entire team for their collective efforts and contributions to these results.\" Third Quarter 2024 Highlights Net income attributable to common stockholders was $1.8 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, as compared to $3.1 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in the comparable prior year period.

Steward Health Care (\"Steward\"), which as previously disclosed, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on May 6, 2024, formally rejected its lease at our healthcare facility in Beaumont, Texas (the \"Beaumont Facility\") as of September 15, 2024. This formal lease rejection, which was approved by the bankruptcy court, allowed for a new, 15-year, triple-net lease with an affiliate of CHRISTUS Health (\"CHRISTUS\") at this facility to become effective. We expect rent to commence on this lease in March or April 2025. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we issued 1.2 million shares of our common stock through our ATM program at an average offering price of $9.95 per share, generating gross proceeds of $12.0 million. Portfolio leased occupancy was 96.1% at September 30, 2024. Leer m\u00e1s Nine Month and Other 2024 Highlights Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $0.6 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, as compared to net income attributable to common stockholders of $15.6 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, in the comparable prior year period. The results for the nine-month period in 2024 include an aggregate loss on sale of investment properties of $1.6 million and the results for the nine-month period in 2023 include an aggregate gain on sale of investment properties of $15.6 million. FFO of $42.6 million, or $0.60 per share and unit, as compared to $45.1 million, or $0.64 per share and unit, in the comparable prior year period. AFFO of $47.6 million, or $0.67 per share and unit, as compared to $48.4 million, or $0.69 per share and unit, in the comparable prior year period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we completed three dispositions that generated aggregate gross proceeds of $20.2 million, resulting in an aggregate loss of $1.6 million. Included in this total is the sale of our facility in Mishawaka, Indiana, receiving gross proceeds of $8.1 million and resulting in a loss of $3.4 million. The lease at this facility was set to expire at the end of this year and the decision to dispose of this property was based on the Company\u2019s lease renewal expectations and its outlook for finding a suitable replacement tenant. In October 2024, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 10 properties in the 15-property portfolio encompassing 159,726 leasable square feet for an aggregate purchase price of $49.5 million. These are fully occupied single tenant triple net properties with aggregate annualized base rent of $3.9 million. In aggregate, the 15-property portfolio had a purchase price of $80.3 million with 254,220 leasable square feet and annualized base rent of $6.4 million. Financial Results Rental revenue for the third quarter 2024 decreased 3.7% year-over-year to $34.2 million, primarily reflecting the impact of changes in the Company\u2019s portfolio between the periods, including a reduction in portfolio occupancy in 2024 compared to 2023 as well as the impact of tenants placed on cash basis accounting subsequent to the end of the third quarter 2023. Total expenses for the third quarter were $32.7 million, compared to $33.0 million for the comparable prior year period. This decrease primarily reflects the impact of current period dispositions, partially offset by the five properties that were acquired during the current period. Interest expense for the third quarter was $7.2 million, unchanged from the comparable prior year period. Slightly lower interest rates were offset by higher average borrowings during the current period compared to the prior period. Net income attributable to common stockholders for the third quarter totaled $1.8 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared to $3.1 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in the comparable prior year period. The Company reported FFO of $13.7 million, or $0.19 per share and unit, and AFFO of $15.3 million, or $0.22 per share and unit, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to FFO of $15.3 million, or $0.22 per share and unit, and AFFO of $16.5 million, or $0.23 per share and unit, in the comparable prior year period. Investment Activity In May 2024, the Company entered into a purchase agreement to acquire a 15-property portfolio of outpatient medical real estate. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of five properties in the 15-property portfolio encompassing 94,494 leasable square feet for an aggregate purchase price of $30.8 million and with aggregate annualized base rent of $2.5 million. In October 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining 10 properties in the 15-property portfolio encompassing 159,726 leasable square feet for an aggregate purchase price of $49.5 million and with aggregate annualized base rent of $3.9 million. In aggregate the 15-property portfolio had a purchase price of $80.3 million with 254,220 leasable square feet and annualized base rent of $6.4 million. Pursuant to the Company\u2019s capital recycling plan, the Company sold two assets in the third quarter of 2024. Specifically, in July 2024, we sold a medical facility located in Panama City, Florida, receiving gross proceeds of $11.0 million, resulting in a gain of $1.7 million. In September 2024, we sold a medical facility located in Panama City Beach, Florida, receiving gross proceeds of $1.1 million, resulting in a gain of $0.1 million. The weighted average cap rate on these dispositions was 7.0%. In October 2024, the Company entered into a purchase agreement to acquire a five-property portfolio for an aggregate purchase price of $69.6 million and a cap rate of 9.0%. The Company expects to complete this acquisition in two tranches during the first half of 2025. The Company\u2019s obligation to close the acquisition is subject to certain customary terms and conditions, including due diligence reviews. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the Company will close this acquisition on a timely basis, or at all. Portfolio Update As of September 30, 2024, the Company\u2019s portfolio was 96.1% occupied and comprised of 4.8 million leasable square feet with an annualized base rent of $107.8 million. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average lease term for the Company\u2019s portfolio was 5.6 years with weighted average annual rent escalations of 2.2%, and the Company\u2019s portfolio rent coverage ratio was 4.6 times. On May 6, 2024, Steward announced that it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. At the time of the bankruptcy filing, Steward represented 2.8% of the Company\u2019s annualized base rent, primarily related to the Beaumont Facility. As of September 15, 2024, Steward formally rejected its lease at the Beaumont Facility. This formal lease rejection, which was approved by the bankruptcy court, allowed for a new, 15-year, triple-net lease with an affiliate of CHRISTUS at this facility to become effective. We expect rent to commence on this lease in March or April 2025. Balance Sheet and Capital At September 30, 2024, total debt outstanding, including outstanding borrowings on the credit facility and notes payable (both net of unamortized debt issuance costs), was $628.9 million and the Company\u2019s leverage was 44.1%. As of September 30, 2024, the Company\u2019s total debt carried a weighted average interest rate of 3.79% and a weighted average remaining term of 2.2 years. As of November 5, 2024, the Company\u2019s borrowing capacity under the credit facility was $221 million. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 1.2 million shares of its common stock through its ATM program at an average offering price of $9.95 per share, generating gross proceeds of $12.0 million. From October 1, 2024 through November 5, 2024, the Company did not issue any shares under its ATM program. Dividends On September 5, 2024, the Board of Directors (the \"Board\") declared a $0.21 per share cash dividend to common stockholders and unitholders of record as of September 20, 2024, which was paid on October 8, 2024, representing the Company\u2019s third quarter 2024 dividend payment. The Board also declared a $0.46875 per share cash dividend to holders of record as of October 15, 2024 of the Company\u2019s Series A Preferred Stock, which was paid on October 31, 2024. This dividend represented the Company\u2019s quarterly dividend on its Series A Preferred Stock for the period from July 31, 2024 through October 30, 2024.

NON\u2010GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES General Management considers certain non-GAAP financial measures to be useful supplemental measures of the Company's operating performance. For the Company, non-GAAP measures consist of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (\"EBITDAre\" and \"Adjusted EBITDAre\"), FFO and AFFO. A non-GAAP financial measure is generally defined as one that purports to measure financial performance, financial position or cash flows, but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable measure determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company reports non-GAAP financial measures because these measures are observed by management to also be among the most predominant measures used by the REIT industry and by industry analysts to evaluate REITs. For these reasons, management deems it appropriate to disclose and discuss these non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures presented herein are not necessarily identical to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. These measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income, as indicators of the Company's financial performance, or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as measures of the Company's liquidity, nor are these measures necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. Management believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the Company's historical consolidated operating results, these measures should be examined in conjunction with net income and cash flows from operations as presented elsewhere herein. FFO and AFFO FFO attributable to common stockholders and noncontrolling interest (\"FFO\") and AFFO attributable to common stockholders and noncontrolling interest (\"AFFO\") are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). The Company considers FFO and AFFO to be important supplemental measures of its operating performance and believes FFO is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. In accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts\u2019 (\"NAREIT\") definition, FFO means net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP before noncontrolling interests of holders of OP units and LTIP units, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property and extraordinary items, less preferred stock dividends, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of debt issuance costs and the amortization of above and below market leases), and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Because FFO excludes real estate-related depreciation and amortization (other than amortization of debt issuance costs and above and below market lease amortization expense), the Company believes that FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared period-over-period, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from the closest GAAP measurement, net income or loss. AFFO is a non-GAAP measure used by many investors and analysts to measure a real estate company\u2019s operating performance by removing the effect of items that do not reflect ongoing property operations. Management calculates AFFO by modifying the NAREIT computation of FFO by adjusting it for certain cash and non-cash items and certain recurring and non-recurring items. For the Company these items include: (a) recurring acquisition and disposition costs, (b) loss on the extinguishment of debt, (c) recurring straight line deferred rental revenue, (d) recurring stock-based compensation expense, (e) recurring amortization of above and below market leases, (f) recurring amortization of debt issuance costs, and (g) other items. Management believes that reporting AFFO in addition to FFO is a useful supplemental measure for the investment community to use when evaluating the operating performance of the Company on a comparative basis. EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre We calculate EBITDA re in accordance with standards established by NAREIT and define EBITDA re as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense, gain or loss on the sale of investment properties, and impairment loss, as applicable. We define Adjusted EBITDA re as EBITDA re plus loss on extinguishment of debt, non-cash stock compensation expense, non-cash intangible amortization related to above and below market leases, preacquisition expense and other normalizing items. Management considers EBITDA re and Adjusted EBITDA re important measures because they provide additional information to allow management, investors, and our current and potential creditors to evaluate and compare our core operating results and our ability to service debt. RENT COVERAGE RATIO For purposes of calculating our portfolio weighted-average EBITDARM coverage ratio (\"Rent Coverage Ratio\"), we excluded credit-rated tenants or their subsidiaries for which financial statements were either not available or not sufficiently detailed. These ratios are based on the latest available information only. Most tenant financial statements are unaudited and we have not independently verified any tenant financial information (audited or unaudited) and, therefore, we cannot assure you that such information is accurate or complete. Certain other tenants (approximately 19% of our portfolio) are excluded from the calculation due to (i) lack of available financial information or (ii) small tenant size. Additionally, included within 19% of non-reporting tenants is Pipeline Healthcare, LLC, which (i) was sold to Heights Healthcare in October 2023 and is being operated under new management and (ii) occupies our only acute-care hospital asset, which is not one of our core asset classes. Additionally, our Rent Coverage Ratio adds back physician distributions and compensation. Management believes all adjustments are reasonable and necessary. ANNUALIZED BASE RENT Annualized base rent represents monthly base rent for September 2024 (or, for recent acquisitions, monthly base rent for the month of acquisition), multiplied by 12 (or base rent net of annualized expenses for properties with gross leases). Accordingly, this methodology produces an annualized amount as of a point in time but does not take into account future (i) contractual rental rate increases, (ii) leasing activity or (iii) lease expirations. Additionally, leases that are accounted for on a cash-collected basis are not included in annualized base rent. CAPITALIZATION RATE The capitalization rate (\"cap rate\") for an acquisition is calculated by dividing current Annualized Base Rent by contractual purchase price. For the portfolio cap rate, certain adjustments, including for subsequent capital invested, are made to the contractual purchase price. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements contained herein may be considered \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and it is the Company\u2019s intent that any such statements be protected by the safe harbor created thereby. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"plan,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"will,\" \"continue\" and other similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions and forecasts of future results. Except for historical information, the statements set forth herein including, but not limited to, any statements regarding our earnings, our liquidity, our tenants\u2019 ability to pay rent to us, expected financial performance (including future cash flows associated with new tenants or the expansion of current properties), future dividends or other financial items; any other statements concerning our plans, strategies, objectives and expectations for future operations and future portfolio occupancy rates, our pipeline of acquisition opportunities and expected acquisition activity, including the timing and/or successful completion of any acquisitions and expected rent receipts on these properties, our expected disposition activity, including the timing and/or successful completion of any dispositions and the expected use of proceeds therefrom, and any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Although the Company believes that the expectations, estimates and assumptions reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in any of the Company\u2019s forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning us and our business, including additional factors that could materially and adversely affect our financial results, include, without limitation, the risks described under Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and in our other filings with the SEC. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The Company does not intend, and undertakes no obligation, to update any forward-looking statement.

Positive Points Global Medical REIT Inc ( NYSE:GMRE ) reported a high occupancy rate of 96.1% with a weighted average lease term of 5.6 years, indicating strong portfolio stability. The company successfully closed on a significant acquisition of a 15-property portfolio, enhancing its asset base with high-quality outpatient medical facilities. GMRE maintained a disciplined approach to balance sheet management, issuing 1.2 million shares of common stock to generate $12 million in gross proceeds. The company secured a new 15-year Triple Net lease with CHRISTUS Health at its Beaumont facility, replacing Steward Health Care and ensuring continued rental income. GMRE's asset recycling strategy resulted in the sale of two medical facilities, generating $12 million in gross proceeds and a gain of $1.8 million, supporting financial flexibility. Negative Points Net income attributable to common shareholders decreased to $1.8 million or 3 per share, down from $3.1 million or 5 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. Total revenues for the third quarter decreased by approximately 3.7% compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower occupancy and tenants being placed on a cash basis. The company faces challenges with increased mortgage rates, which have tempered demand and affected acquisition opportunities. GMRE's leverage ratio increased to 44.1%, with a potential rise to 46% by year-end if no asset sales or equity raises occur, slightly above the target range. The company incurred significant capital expenditures, including $900,000 in CapEx for the Beaumont facility, impacting cash flow and financial resources. Story Continues Q & A Highlights Q : When considering funding options, which do you view as more attractive today: equity or dispositions? How much do you have left to fund to sustain your leverage target? A : Robert Kiernan, CFO: We ended the quarter at a leverage of 44%. Without asset sales or equity raises in Q4, we'd end the year at 46%, slightly outside our target range. We're not uncomfortable going above this range temporarily. We have potential sales opportunities and would consider tapping equity markets if favorable. Q : Are there any assets you're currently marketing, and how have interest rates affected buyer interest and cap rates? A : Robert Kiernan, CFO: We are considering assets for sale, and there is pressure on pricing due to evolving market conditions. Alfonzo Leon, CIO: Optimism about rate cuts increased interest, but recent mortgage rate hikes have subdued it. The market is sending mixed signals. Q : How comfortable are you moving forward with additional deals before funding the announced acquisitions? A : Alfonzo Leon, CIO: We evaluate our portfolio regularly for potential sales and consider market conditions. We focus on acquisitions step by step, ensuring we align with our financial strategy. Q : Can you provide details on the states where the new assets are being acquired? A : Alfonzo Leon, CIO: We are keeping the states confidential during due diligence for confidentiality purposes. More details will be provided as we progress. Q : What is the plan to fund the portfolio deal and future acquisitions? Will you raise debt as well? A : Jeffrey Busch, CEO: We plan to fund through dispositions and equity. We raised $12 million in equity last quarter and have sales in process. We may temporarily exceed our debt target but focus on equity and dispositions. For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .
