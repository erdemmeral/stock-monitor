and Markets Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 5:24 PM 6 min read Company Logo Dublin, Jan. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Medical Devices: Developing Effective Post Market Surveillance and Complaint Handling Systems\" training has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. What are U.S. FDA CGMP expectations/requirements for Post Market Surveillance and Complaint Handling? This webinar will examine Section 522 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), as well as appropriate articles/Annexes of the EU's MDR, which require manufacturers to conduct post-market surveillance at the time of approval or clearance or at any time thereafter of certain class II or class III devices. Section 522 is implemented in 21 CFR 822. This formal post-market surveillance is the active, systematic, scientifically valid collection, analysis, and interpretation of data or other information about a marketed device. A more generalized \"post market surveillance\"/complaint handling is also a requirement under the device CGMPs, 21 CFR 820, -.100 - CAPA, and -.198 - Complaints. Data collected under post-market surveillance helps to address important public health questions on the safety and effectiveness of a device, often resulting in improvements in device design and manufacture. Similar requirements exist in the EU's MDR, as part of the final \"Clinical Phase\". Why Should You Attend Global companies must meet US FDA 21 CFR 820 (The QSR) requirements in order to sell such devices in the US, no matter where they are manufactured. These companies must pass FDA compliance inspections (audits) to 21 CFR 820. One of the key components of these device CGMPs is addressing post-market use issues and complaints/CAPA. The FDA expects companies to have effective programs in place to capture post-market problems/non-conformances, react to minimize risk to users/patients, and use such data for product improvement. With certain devices, the FDA mandates such controls. How does failure to comply result in adulterated products, 483 Observations, Warning Letters, and worse. What are the key components of a CGMP-compliant post-market surveillance and complaint-handling system? Where does Medical Device Reporting/Adverse Events fit into such a system? This two-day seminar will provide suggested and mandated approaches, and the answers to these and other related questions. Who Should Attend: Senior management Regulatory Affairs Quality Assurance Production R&D and Engineering All personnel involved in the U.S. FDA-regulated medical device development, manufacture, and post market activities. Especially those involved in new medical device/combination product development, non-conformances and field problems/complaints, line extensions, and incremental product improvements; having to evaluate those changes in light of the DHF/CGMPs, and then document these actions in harmony with the regulations.

Capital and its affiliate REIT, Dwight Mortgage Trust (DMT), successfully closed a total of $260.5 million in real estate financings. Notable transactions included a HUD loan for Integra Isles Apartments, as well as bridge loans for Willow Creek Apartments and a portfolio of three skilled nursing facilities. Dwight Capital closed a $51.8 million HUD 221(d)(4) construction loan for the development of Integra Isles, a planned 264-unit market rate apartment community in Leesburg, Florida. Situated on 15.5 acres, the development will feature 11 three-story garden-style buildings with 132 one-bedroom, 114 two-bedroom, and 18 three-bedroom units, along with a clubhouse and leasing office. Integra Isles is designed to offer a diverse range of amenities, including a clubhouse with a game room, fitness center, resort-style pool with cabanas, dog park, indoor pet spa, grill station, fire pit, and sports bar. The thoughtful design extends into each apartment with premium finishes such as granite countertops, luxury vinyl flooring, energy-efficient stainless-steel appliances, and screened balconies or patios. The loan proceeds will fund both construction and permanent financing for the developer, Integra Land Company. The project qualifies for a reduced Green Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP) of 25 basis points, as Integra Isles is pending a National Green Building Standard (\"NGBS\") Bronze Certification. This transaction was originated by Partner Brandon Baksh and Senior Originator Karnveer Bal . DMT provided $56.0 million in bridge financing for Willow Creek Apartments, a 998-unit, garden-style apartment complex in Kansas City, MO. Spanning nearly 70 acres, the property includes 43 residential buildings offering one-, two-, and three-bedroom units. Residences feature private balconies or patios, fireplaces, large closets, and additional storage space. Community amenities include two swimming pools, a fitness center, racquetball and tennis courts, garage parking, and a clubhouse with a business center. The loan proceeds will be used to refinance existing debt, complete remaining construction costs, cover closing costs, and fund required escrows. Managing Director David Scheer originated this transaction on behalf of the borrower, KC Willow Creek LLC. DMT also financed a $53.3 million bridge acquisition loan for a portfolio of three skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) totaling 258 beds in West Virginia and Oregon. To supplement this loan, Dwight Healthcare Funding (DHF) provided a $15.0MM revolving line of credit (RLOC) to support the ongoing working capital needs of these three SNFs.

Wed, Dec 4, 2024, 1:04 PM 5 min read Company Logo This webinar will examine Section 522 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), as well as appropriate articles/Annexes of the EU's MDR, which require manufacturers to conduct post-market surveillance at the time of approval or clearance or at any time thereafter of certain class II or class III devices. Section 522 is implemented in 21 CFR 822. Dublin, Dec. 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Medical Devices: Developing Effective Post Market Surveillance and Complaint Handling Systems\" training has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. What are U.S. FDA CGMP expectations/requirements for Post Market Surveillance and Complaint Handling? This formal post-market surveillance is the active, systematic, scientifically valid collection, analysis, and interpretation of data or other information about a marketed device. A more generalized \"post market surveillance\"/complaint handling is also a requirement under the device CGMPs, 21 CFR 820, -.100 - CAPA, and -.198 - Complaints. Data collected under post-market surveillance helps to address important public health questions on the safety and effectiveness of a device, often resulting in improvements in device design and manufacture. Similar requirements exist in the EU's MDR, as part of the final \"Clinical Phase\". Why Should You Attend Global companies must meet US FDA 21 CFR 820 (The QSR) requirements in order to sell such devices in the US, no matter where they are manufactured. These companies must pass FDA compliance inspections (audits) to 21 CFR 820. One of the key components of these device CGMPs is addressing post-market use issues and complaints/CAPA. The FDA expects companies to have effective programs in place to capture post-market problems/non-conformances, react to minimize risk to users/patients, and use such data for product improvement. With certain devices, the FDA mandates such controls. How does failure to comply result in adulterated products, 483 Observations, Warning Letters, and worse. What are the key components of a CGMP-compliant post-market surveillance and complaint-handling system? Where does Medical Device Reporting/Adverse Events fit into such a system? This two-day seminar will provide suggested and mandated approaches, and the answers to these and other related questions. 12.0 RAC CREDITS RAPS - This course has been pre-approved by RAPS as eligible for up to 12 credits towards a participant's RAC recertification upon full completion. Who Should Attend: Senior management Regulatory Affairs Quality Assurance Production R&D and Engineering All personnel involved in the U.S. FDA-regulated medical device development, manufacture, and post market activities. Especially those involved in new medical device/combination product development, non-conformances and field problems/complaints, line extensions, and incremental product improvements; having to evaluate those changes in light of the DHF/CGMPs, and then document these actions in harmony with the regulations.

slashed on Trump win Chris Price Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 10:22 PM 51 min read In This Article: ^FTSE -0.19% Stocks hit record highs on Wall Street but fresh tariffs could harm the UK economy - REUTERS/Andrew Kelly Goldman Sachs has slashed its forecast for British and European economic growth next year amid fears Donald Trump will slap taxes on imported goods from around the world. The investment bank now expects the UK economy to grow by 1.4pc next year, down from previous forecasts of 1.6pc. It also predicts the eurozone will expand by 0.8pc, a downgrade from earlier forecasts of 1.1pc. The bank\u2019s economists warn that a fresh influx of US tariffs on imports from Europe will hammer growth, particularly if the latter retaliates with border taxes of its own. That would knock 1pc from eurozone GDP, Goldman Sachs said, including 1.1pc from trade-dependent Germany and 0.7pc from Britain\u2019s economy. However, some of that would be compensated by extra spending on defence, as European nations prepare for Trump potentially scaling back American support for Ukraine. \u201cTaken together, our analysis points to a 0.5pc hit to real GDP in the eurozone, ranging from 0.6pc in Germany to 0.3pc in Italy, with a moderate 0.4pc hit to the UK,\u201d said Goldman\u2019s analysts, led by Sven Jari Stehn. They predict that the bulk of the impact on growth will fall between the first and fourth quarter of next year. Christian Schulz at Citi added that the impact will come not only from tariffs on goods sold by European businesses to Americans but also from those exported to China, which faces a mooted 60pc tariff on products sold to the US. He said: \u201cEU goods exports were worth 3.1pc of EU GDP in 2023, with a trade surplus worth 1.1pc of GDP. Germany and Italy would be more exposed than the EU average; France and Spain less.\u201d Xiangrong Yu at Citi said a full 60pc tariff on Chinese goods, as threatened by Mr Trump, would slash China\u2019s growth. He said: \u201cA possible 60pc tariff could in theory make it prohibitive for Chinese goods to enter the US market. The growth impact could be around 2.4 percentage points under such an extreme scenario.\u201d Read the latest updates below. 07:22 PM GMT Signing off... Thanks for joining us on the Markets blog today. The re-election of Donald Trump has caused US stocks to hit all-time highs, but major European stock indexes fell. Currently the S&P 500 is up 2.4pc, the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 leading US companies is up 3.4pc and the technology-heavy Nasdaq is up 2.8pc. The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed down 0.5pc. Strategists at UBS told clients: We see less upside for European equities under a Trump presidency. Story Continues We will be back in the morning before the London Stock Exchange reopens, but you can also read our live blog on the US election results here . 07:11 PM GMT It\u2019s the economy, stupid \u2013 of course the Democrats lost You can tell the story of this election in two numbers. Under President Joe Biden, the net worth of the bottom 50pc of American households grew by 8.5pc in real terms. Under Donald Trump, from January 2017 to January 2021, it grew by 127pc. People remembered that, and now Trump has again been elected president. While polls were tight throughout the race, heading into election day the issue voters said they cared about most was the economy, and the candidate they said was best able to handle it was Trump. Under Biden, consumer sentiment sank lower than its lowest point in the pandemic, and the exit polls bore this story out. Voters worried that the economy was doing badly, they were more likely to feel that their families were worse off than they were four years ago, they were overwhelmingly likely to say that inflation had caused them hardships . And they were voting Republican. Democrats can argue that voters were wrong until they\u2019re blue in the face. They can say that the macroeconomic top line was good, that GDP growth, even adjusted for inflation, has been robust overall and in per capita terms, or that unemployment is on par with its rate in 2018, or that inflation is back on target. Absolutely none of that will change the fact that voters were able to compare their experience under Biden with their experience under Trump, and make up their own minds.

Trump repeatedly praised the Tesla billionaire during his victory speech, calling him a \u201cspecial guy\u201d and a \u201csuper-genius\u201d. The call-out was the reward for Musk donating huge sums to the Republican\u2019s campaign, for planting himself in Pennsylvania to run a get-out-the-vote operation, and for ceaselessly promoting Trump to his 203m followers on the social network now known as X. He also helped to secure the endorsement of podcasting star Joe Rogan, who said he had been influenced by \u201cthe great and powerful Elon Musk\u201d. Musk spent more than $130m to support Trump and other Republicans, although it is already an investment that has repaid itself several times over. Tesla\u2019s shares rose 14pc in pre-market trading on Wednesday, adding around $15bn to Musk\u2019s $264bn fortune. Read the full article... Elon Musk spent more than $130m to support Trump and other Republicans - Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images 06:36 PM GMT JPMorgan boss urges Americans to \u2018unite\u2019 behind new president Wall Street titan Jamie Dimon has urged Americans to unite behind its president elect, while a source said he would remain at the bank rather than join Donald Trump\u2019s administration. Mr Dimon has been the subject of repeated speculation as a candidate for US Treasury Secretary by both Republicans and Democrats, but he said last month that his chances of taking an official post were \u201calmost nil\u201d. \u201cOur country is now concluding one of the hardest fought and at times divisive elections in our recent history,\u201d Mr Dimon said in a statement on Tuesday before the election results emerged. \u201cSoon it will be time for all of us to unite behind our President elect and all of our national leaders.\u201d Mr Dimon had previously downplayed the chances of taking a government position, telling analysts in October that \u201cI probably am not going to do it ... but I always reserve the right\u201d to reconsider. JPMorgan\u2019s stock surged 11.2pc today alongside strong gains for other US bank stocks. Investors speculated the incoming administration would be more friendly to lenders. The Telegraph has approached JPMorgan for comment. There had been speculation that Jamie Dimon could become US Treasury Secretary - Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters 06:06 PM GMT French central banker says Trump \u2018increases risks\u2019 Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election \u201cincreases risks for the global economy\u201d, Bank of France chief Francois Villeroy de Galhau said today. With \u201clikely more protectionism\u201d and an increased US budget deficit, a second Trump term \u201cboth increases risks for the global economy and the need for Europe to remobilise,\u201d Mr Villeroy said. Francois Villeroy de Galhau warned about \u2018risks\u2019 - Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images 05:59 PM GMT UK could be hit by stagflation after Trump victory, warn economists The election of Donald Trump will make life more difficult for the Bank of England and is \u201clikely to be stagflationary\u201d, leading economists have said. Stagflation is the combination of high inflation accompanied with unemployment and stagnant demand.

Trader Walter Lundon shows off his Trump top on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange today - Timothy A. Clary/AFP via Getty Images 05:43 PM GMT Worries about Trump tariff curbed the FTSE 100 The FTSE 100 surged this morning after the US election result became clear, rising by as much as 1.6pc at one point, but it erased its gains in the afternoon. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the turnaround came as investors \u201cswitched their focus to concerns about the macroeconomic environment\u201d. She said: If Trump\u2019s most radical plans for tariffs are imposed there are deepening concerns about the knock-on effect on the UK and other European economies. Mr Trump has repeatedly said he will impose sweeping import tariffs which, in turn, could hit UK growth, according to economists. 05:40 PM GMT Cryptocurrency stocks soar after defeat of Democrats Cryptocurrency stocks soared today as investors cheered an end to the Democrats\u2019 crackdown on the sector as Donald Trump swept to victory in the race for the White House. Shares in Coinbase, the cryptocurrency exchange, climbed by 25pc, valuing the business at $60bn (\u00a346bn). Robinhood, the stock trading app which also offers cryptocurrency trading, was trading up more than 17pc in New York. The price of Bitcoin climbed more than 7pc to a record $75,000 in the wake of Mr Trump\u2019s victory. Coinbase, one of the most popular cryptocurrency apps, has been locked in a bitter row with US regulators, with the US Securities and Exchange Commission suing the company for allegedly offering unregistered securities. Coinbase has accused the regulator of failing to provide clear rules for trading cryptocurrencies and countersued the agency. The cases are ongoing. Under Joe Biden\u2019s White House, regulators have tightened the screws on the cryptocurrency industry, which has been plagued by fraud, cyber attacks and bankruptcies, launching a series of legal challenges and investigations against companies in the sector. Mr Trump, however, has pledged to \u201cend [the] Democrats\u2019 unlawful and un-American crypto crackdown\u201d and \u201cdefend the right to mine Bitcoin\u201d. His support for the industry helped garner tens of millions of dollars in donations from prominent cryptocurrency executives, despite Mr Trump once warning Bitcoin represented a \u201cscam against the dollar\u201d. Donald Trump at the Bitcoin 2024 event in Nashville, Tennessee, in July - Kevin Wurm/Reuters 05:37 PM GMT Dollar surges while Mexican peso slumps after Trump victory Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election unleashed a massive rally in the dollar, fuelled a rally on Wall Street and punished bond prices as expectations of tax cuts and tariffs on imports drove optimism about economic growth. Wall Street indexes soared, with the benchmark S&P 500 jumping 2.1pc to a record high and huge gains in areas such as small cap stocks and banks that are poised to benefit from President Trump\u2019s expected lighter regulatory touch. The Dow Jones gained 3.2pc and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 2.4pc. The dollar was set for its largest one-day jump in over two years. Bitcoin hit record highs and US Treasury notes were battered. Trump\u2019s pledges to raise tariffs, cut taxes and slash regulations encouraged investors to dive into a range of assets that looked likely to benefit from such policies. Some markets that could suffer under tougher tariffs, including those in some of major US trading partners, bore the brunt of the sell-off. The Mexican peso slumped to its lowest in over two years while the euro was set for its largest daily drop since 2020. Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said: Everywhere you look, there\u2019s the thumb prints of these election results for markets. 05:23 PM GMT Oil prices volatile as markets mull Trump supply boost The price of oil has been fluctuating today as traders mull what a second Trump presidency mean for the energy sector. The main US measure of oil prices - called West Texas Intermediate - fell as much as 3.1pc today. It has also been up as much as 0.9pc and is currently down 0.1pc. Guy Foster, chief strategist at wealth manager RBC Brewin Dolphin, said: Oil has been volatile as news of the election result has filtered in. President Trump has been outspoken about his desire to reinvigorate the energy sector. He has considerable ability to influence regulation, which could affect both the demand for, and supply of energy. 05:03 PM GMT FTSE 100 gains fizzle out but FTSE 250 closes up The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 jumped by about 1.6pc when markets opened this morning as an anticipated Republican win provided some certainty for the future of the world\u2019s biggest economy. It remained about 1.2pc higher later in the morning when it was declared that Donald Trump had won the election. However, the index fizzled out this afternoon, closing 0.1pc down. Meanwhile, the FTSE 250 gained 0.4pc, having risen as much as 2.2pc. 04:57 PM GMT What does the Trump administration mean for the world? 04:56 PM GMT Scotch whisky could be hammered by Trump presidency Scotch whisky and other top British food and drink exports could be major losers if Donald Trump imposes heavy tariffs. Marco Forgione, director general of the Chartered Institute of Export and International Trade, said: During the election, Trump pledged to implement a fresh flat tariff on imported goods of 20pc, rising to 60pc for those from China. This could reshape global trade and, if projections from the IMF are to be believed, wipe out the equivalent of the French and German economies combined from global GDP. Trump has argued the measures would reshore manufacturing on US soil. Jonathan Reynolds, the Business Secretary, during a visit to Glengoyne Distillery in Dumgoyne, Killearn - Andrew Milligan/PA Wire 04:39 PM GMT US inflation and rates to be higher as Trump boosts industry Traders are predicting higher US inflation and interest rates as a result of the Trump election. The yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds rose to 4.457pc, compared to 4.298pc just two days ago, while the stock market has jumped on positivity for corporate profits. David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said: If he\u2019s able to fully implement his agenda, it means bigger deficits, bigger tax cuts, and also, because of tariffs, higher inflation. The higher inflation and the bigger deficits should push up long-term interest rates. Meanwhile, Andrea Scauri, a Swiss-based senior portfolio manager at wealth manager Lemanik, said: With Trump\u2019s victory, you\u2019ll get much stronger fiscal policies compared to what might have been under a Democratic administration. This will have repercussions for inflation, and you can see that already with this morning\u2019s rise in Treasury yields. 04:24 PM GMT Investors believe Trump means higher profits, says analyst Wall Street\u2019s favourable reaction to the Trump presidency is because investors think bigger profits are coming, an analyst has said. Daniel Casali, chief investment strategist at Evelyn Partners, said markets were reacting positively to the prospect of a \u201cclear Trump victory\u201d and Republicans controlling Congress. He said: The combination of a clean sweep victory means tax cuts are likely over the coming year.

Clary/AFP via Getty Images 04:11 PM GMT Wall Street\u2019s volatility gauge drops Wall Street\u2019s main measure of volatility has dropped by 20.2pc today as Mr Trump\u2019s decisive victory curbed a major source of uncertainty. The so-called Vix - a popular measure of volatility on the S&P 500 - dropped to its lowest level since September. The mood among investors towards the US is enthusiastic this afternoon, with the S&P up 1.8pc, the Dow Jones up 3.1pc and the Nasdaq up 2pc. Stocks jump on the New York Stock Exchange today after Donald Trump\u2019s victory - Timopthy A. Clary/AFP via Getty Images 04:03 PM GMT Bank of England poised to cut rates as Trump casts uncertainty on global economy UK borrowing costs are set to be cut for the second time this year, despite tax changes and a Donald Trump victory in the US casting uncertainty over the future path of interest rates. Julian Jessop, a leading economist, suggested that the election of President Trump and the Budget strengthened the case for the Bank of England to cut rates \u201cto reassure markets\u201d. Most economists think policymakers at the Bank of England will opt to reduce interest rates to 4.75pc on Thursday. Rates currently sit at 5pc after being cut by 0.25 percentage points in August, the first reduction since 2020, then kept the same in September. Since then, the latest official data showed UK Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation fell to 1.7pc in September, the lowest level since April 2021. 03:53 PM GMT Trump Media suffers $19.2m election day loss and shares surge higher The parent company of Donald Trump\u2019s social networking site Truth Social lost $19.2m (\u00a314.9m) in the last quarter, according to an earnings report released on the same day he won back the presidency. Trump Media and Technology Group reported late on Tuesday that much of that loss stemmed from more than $12m in legal fees, along with a decline in revenue, according to the surprise election day earnings report. Its stock price surged Wednesday but that was more likely due to Trump\u2019s defeat of Kamala Harris to retake the presidency than on its profit prospects. President Trump created the company after he was banned from Twitter and Facebook following the Jan 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Based in Sarasota, Florida, it has been losing money and struggling to raise revenue. Revenue for the three-month period that ended on Sept 30 was just over $1m, down nearly 6pc from a year earlier. Trump Media, based in Sarasota, Florida, has lost more than $363m so far this year. Trump Media said some of its costs related to the launch of its new TV streaming service called Truth+. Chief executive Devin Nunes said the company \u201ccontinues to explore additional possibilities for growth\u201d such as mergers with other companies that \u201cwould benefit from Trump Media technology and branding\u201d. The company said in a regulatory finding that its success depends in part on \u201cthe reputation and popularity of President Donald J. Trump\u201d. Shares are currently up more than 6pc. 03:46 PM GMT Investors more favourable to UK stocks than European ones after Trump victory Investors have sent down European shares today amid worries that Donald Trump\u2019s love of tariffs will hurt continental businesses. The pan-European Stoxx 600 (which includes some British businesses) is down 0.3pc, while the French Cac 40 is down 0.4pc and Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.9pc. It\u2019s rosier in London, however. The FTSE 100 is currently flat after being in positive territory most of the day, while the FTSE 250 is up 0.6pc. 03:38 PM GMT UK should mirror Trump tax cuts, says think tank Britain should copy Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts and negotiate with the new US president to avoid new tariffs, a free-market economist has told The Telegraph. Madsen Pirie, president of the Adam Smith Institute, said: The UK should prepare to match the tax cuts likely to boost the US economy and should negotiate in earnest to shield UK exporters from possible US tariffs. During the election campaign, Mr Trump said: We gave you the biggest tax cuts in history, and we\u2019ll do it again \u2013 but even bigger this time. Rachel Reeves has raised taxes when America looks set to cut its burden - Chris J. Ratcliffe/Bloomberg 03:30 PM GMT Reeves pledges to push back against Trump tariff plan Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said the UK would make \u201cstrong representations\u201d to president-elect Donald Trump about the need to protect free trade. Mr Trump has said he wants to increase tariffs on goods imported from around the world by 10pc, rising to 60pc on goods from China. At the Treasury Committee, Ms Reeves said: \u201cWe\u2019re not just a passive actor in this. \u201cIt\u2019s a trade relationship with the United States and we will make strong representations about the importance of free and open trade, not just between ourselves and the United States, but globally, and the US also benefit from those that access to free and open trade with us and other countries around the world, and it\u2019s what makes us richer as societies to benefit from that.\u201d Asked by Tory former Treasury minister John Glen if it was realistic to seek to influence Mr Trump, the Chancellor said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got another couple of months before the inauguration. \u201cObviously, you know, we will begin those conversations. We\u2019ll prepare for different eventualities. \u201cI absolutely do not want to sound in any way sanguine. On the other hand, I am optimistic about our ability to shape the global economic agenda, as we have under successive governments.\u201d I hope you\u2019ve found the live updates in this blog helpful so far and, at this point, I\u2019ll hand you over to my ever eager colleague Alex Singleton . Rachel Reeves appears in front of the Treasury select committee - House of Commons/UK Parliament/PA Wire 03:14 PM GMT Wall Street surges as market receives post-election certainty, say analysts US stocks have surged as the markets received the certainty it craved, according to analysts. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average have hit intraday record highs, with stock market giants like Amazon also rising to all-time peaks. Ryan Grabinski, an analyst at Strategas, said: \u201cThe biggest takeaway from last night is that we received certainty that the market craves. \u201cThis will allow both business and consumer confidence to improve. Attention now should shift to the Fed meeting tomorrow. \u201cThe 10-year is approaching the 4.5pc level, that\u2019s the level risk assets ran into some trouble in the last 24 months.\u201d Oliver Blackbourn of Janus Henderson added: \u201cFor the moment, though, markets are focused on the upsides that come with certainty after an election and the prospect of pro-growth policy.\u201d 03:00 PM GMT Trade with US will continue under Trump, insists Reeves Rachel Reeves has told MPs that Britain will continue to have a \u201cstrong and healthy economic relationship\u201d with the US under Donald Trump The Chancellor said it \u201cis too early to start making changes to forecasts for our economy because of the election of a president in the United States\u201d. Appearing in front of the Treasury select committee, she said: \u201cOur trading relationship, our economic relationship with the United States is absolutely crucial. \u201cThe US are our single biggest trading partner. Trade between our two countries is \u00a3311bn a year so, of course, that relationship is crucial. \u201cAnd our special relationship obviously goes much beyond trade for our security and defence relationship. \u201cI\u2019m confident that those trade flows will continue under the new President. \u201cIndeed President Trump has been President of the United States before and we continue to have a strong and healthy economic relationship. \u201cWe as a Government will continue to make the case for free trade. We are an open trading economy. We benefit from that with our trading relationships with Europe, the Middle East, with Asia and of course with the US.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 3pc to 43,501.56 in its biggest jump in two years, while the S&P 500 rose 2pc to 5,899.89. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose by 1.8pc to 18,773.01. Meanwhile, European stocks have given up earlier gains amid the threat of a tariff war from the Trump administration, which it is feared could impact growth. The FTSE 100 was up 0.2pc, having earlier climbed as much as 1.6pc, while the Cac 40 in Paris, the Dax in Frankfurt and the FTSE MIB in Milan were all lower. 02:19 PM GMT Eurozone faces \u2018full-blown recession\u2019 after Trump win The eurozone is at risk of a \u201cfull-blown recession\u201d after Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, according to economists. Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING, said: \u201cA looming new trade war could push the eurozone economy from sluggish growth into a full-blown recession. \u201cThe already struggling German economy, which heavily relies on trade with the US, would be particularly hard hit by tariffs on European automotives. \u201cAdditionally, uncertainty about Trump\u2019s stance on Ukraine and NATO could undermine the recently stabilised economic confidence indicators across the eurozone. \u201cEven though tariffs might not impact Europe until late 2025, the renewed uncertainty and trade war fears could drive the eurozone economy into recession at the turn of the year.\u201d 02:13 PM GMT Mike Ashley\u2019s Frasers threatens legal action over potential Boohoo break-up In some UK corporate news, Mike Ashley has issued a legal threat to Boohoo\u2019s board as the battle for control of the fast fashion empire intensifies. Mr Ashley\u2019s Frasers Group published an open letter to Boohoo\u2019s board in which it said it would \u201cnot hesitate\u00a0to push for legal action\u201d against the company\u2019s non-executive directors if they were found to have breached their duties as board members. It said this meant them acting \u201chonestly and in good faith in the way most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole\u201d, as well as fairly between shareholders. Frasers is the largest single shareholder in Boohoo with a 27pc stake. Boohoo co-founder Mahmud Kamani, who acts as its chairman, also holds a 12.5pc stake. It comes as the latest twist in the tussle for\u00a0control at the British fast fashion giant, which has escalated since Boohoo last month announced a review into its structure . Boohoo had suggested this process could involve selling off various brands, including Debenhams, Karen Millen and PrettyLittleThing. In the latest letter, Frasers demanded that Boohoo confirm publicly that it would not sell off any brands without getting shareholder approval. It said it would be \u201cforced to consider [its] legal rights of redress\u201d if the company disposed of assets at a low price or sold to businesses controlled by Mr Kamani. Frasers wrote that the Boohoo board must \u201cstop, once and for all, its utter disregard for shareholder views\u201d. Mike Ashley\u2019s Frasers has threatened legal action against the board of Boohoo - Paul Grover 01:59 PM GMT Goldman Sachs slashes UK growth forecast after Trump win Goldman Sachs has slashed its forecast for British and European economic growth next year amid fears Donald Trump will slap taxes on imported goods from around the world. The investment bank now expects the UK economy to grow by 1.4pc next year - down from previous forecasts of 1.6pc - with the eurozone expanding by 0.8pc, a downgrade from earlier forecasts of 1.1pc. Its economists warn that more US tariffs on imports from Europe will hammer growth, particularly if the old continent retaliates with border taxes of its own. That would knock 1pc from eurozone GDP, including 1.1pc from trade-dependent Germany, and 0.7pc from Britain\u2019s economy. Some of that would be compensated for by extra spending on defence, as European nations ramp up spending to try to replace any reduced American support for Ukraine\u2019s defence against Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion. \u201cTaken together, our analysis points to a 0.5pc hit to real GDP in the eurozone, ranging from 0.6pc in Germany to 0.3pc in Italy, with a moderate 0.4pc hit to the UK. We expect the bulk of the growth hit to materialise between 2025Q1 and 2025Q4,\u201d said Goldman\u2019s analysts, led by Sven Jari Stehn. Christian Schulz at Citi said the impact will come not only from tariffs on goods which European businesses sell to Americans, but also from those which they send to China, which faces a mooted 60pc tariff on the products it sells to the US. \u201cEU goods exports were worth 3.1pc of EU GDP in 2023, with a trade surplus worth 1.1pc of GDP. Germany and Italy would be more exposed than the EU average; France and Spain less,\u201d he said. 01:45 PM GMT Gold falls at fastest pace in eight months The price of gold has fallen at its sharpest pace since April after Donald Trump won the US presidential election. Bullion was down as much as 2.8pc to $2,664.07 as the Republican candidate\u2019s victory sent the value of the dollar higher. A surge in the US currency makes the precious metal more expensive for many global buyers. Matthew Jones, precious metals analyst at Solomon Global, said: \u201cThis rally in the dollar and yields has put pressure on gold, which traditionally falls as real interest rates rise, reflecting reduced demand for safe-haven assets in the short term.\u201d 01:30 PM GMT FTSE 100 higher as Trump unleashes shockwaves on markets The FTSE 100 remains up 0.8pc today, having surged as much as 1.6pc after Donald Trump\u2019s historic comeback election victory. US-exposed companies remain the best performers, with Ashtead Group topping the index with gains of 6.1pc. The FTSE 100 is boosted by a stronger dollar - which has enjoyed its biggest gains on global markets in four years - as most of its companies measure their profits in the US currency. On Wall Street, stocks are poised to surge at the opening bell, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average on track for gains of 3pc, the S&P 500 expected to rise 2.1pc and the Nasdaq heading for gains of 1.7pc. Stocks have been boosted by expectations that Mr Trump will cut taxes and boost borrowing, stimulating demand. Marvin Loh, senior macro strategist at State Street Global Markets, told Bloomberg TV: \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about this Trump trade for a while. \u201cThe fairly aggressive market reaction shows that investors didn\u2019t know what to put on, and now they know. \u201cA lot of us will be asking is which ones potentially have either a lot more to move or really does not yet reflect the type of administration.\u201d 01:10 PM GMT Fears of fresh wave of global inflation after Trump declares victory Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential election has reignited fears that he will unleash a fresh wave of global inflation. Economists predicted tit-for-tat tariffs that would push up global prices. Analysts said victory for the Republicans \u2013 including across Congress \u2013 would also push down growth in Europe , extending the bloc\u2019s era of stagnancy. The dollar, US borrowing costs and shares all rose this morning in anticipation of Trump\u2019s pledge to deregulate and cut taxes. Read how markets are expected to react . Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to introduce tariffs - AP Photo/Alex Brandon 12:38 PM GMT Euro at risk of parity with dollar over Trump \u2018protectionism\u2019, warn analysts The euro could hit parity with the dollar next year as tariffs expected from Donald Trump hurt the European economy, analysts have warned. Chris Turner, head of markets at ING, said \u201cprotectionism is a given and a negative for the currencies of the rest of the world\u201d following the Republican\u2019s victory, which has sent the value of the dollar surging. He said the \u201cimmediate target\u201d for the currency would be a fall to $1.05, having dropped 2.1pc today to $1.07. He said that things would be worse for the euro if the Republicans fail to win the House of Representatives in Congress because \u201cworld growth would not be able to enjoy as much support given the potential scaling back of prospective Trump tax cuts\u201d. He added that emerging market currencies could also be hit by the prospect of relatively higher US interest rates and weaker world trade growth, particularly Hungary, Brazil and central and eastern European currencies, which \u201clook vulnerable\u201d. 12:14 PM GMT Euro poised for steepest loss in eight years The euro is down 2.1pc against the dollar following Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, putting it on track for its worst day since 2016. Bas Kooijman, chief executive of DHF Capital, said the euro had slumped to $1.07 amid \u201cgrowing concern that a Trump presidency could lead to higher tariffs and adversely affect European economies\u201d. He said: \u201cThe uncertainty surrounding trade policies and geopolitical tensions under Trump contributed to fears of disruptions in European trade.\u201d Daniela Sabin Hathorn, senior market analyst at Capital.com, said: \u201cThe euro economy is seen as weaker which suggests more monetary easing from the ECB, weighing on the pairs ability to move higher.\u201d The pound remains down 1.3pc against the dollar at $1.286, and is up 0.6pc against the euro, which is worth 83.3p. 11:59 AM GMT Traders reduce bets on US interest rate cuts Traders are reducing bets on the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates in the coming months as Donald Trump\u2019s policies are expected to fuel inflation. Money markets indicate the Fed will still reduce borrowing costs at its next meeting on Thursday, when the Bank of England is also predicted to announce a rate cut. However, while bets on reductions in UK borrowing costs appear unchanged, the Fed is now thought to be less likely to cut rates in the months ahead, according to derivates trades. John Hardy, chief macro-strategist at investment platform Saxo, there will likely be a change in the relationship between interest rates in Britain and America. He said: \u201cFed decisions have tremendous influence because it is effectively the central bank for the world. So the price of borrowing US dollars, the interest rate, is the global price for borrowing money. \u201cWith a Trump win, the first impulse would be for the US dollar to strengthen on the anticipation of stimulative measures and the Fed could end up cutting less. \u201cIt would be reasonable to posit that if US rates and UK rates widen in the US dollar\u2019s favour, it will contribute to shifts in the sterling-dollar exchange rate to the downside.\u201d 11:49 AM GMT UK borrowing costs surge after Trump victory The cost of borrowing for the UK government has risen after Donald Trump\u2019s victory raised concerns about higher inflation in the years ahead. The yield on 30-year bonds - the return the Government promises to buyers of its debt - has risen above 5pc for the first time this year. The yield on 10-year bonds - known as gilts - has risen slightly to 4.54pc amid expectations that the US Federal Reserve will be forced to keep interest rates higher. Daniela Sabin Hathorn, senior market analyst at Capital.com, said: \u201cThe bond market is going to be key over the coming days as it will give insight into how much bond traders are willing to push back on Trump\u2019s suggested policies. \u201cIf the Republicans are also confirmed to have taken victory in the House of Representatives \u2013 which is vital for tax policy \u2013 then we could see further volatility in bonds. \u201cHis tax policies and tariff proposals are the key concern for bond markets, so we\u2019ll have to see how much further pushback bond traders offer in the coming days. A key target for the US 10-year yield will be the 4.5pc mark, followed by 5pc.\u201d 11:40 AM GMT Donald Trump\u2019s wealth to jump by $1.4bn as he heads to the White House Donald Trump\u2019s wealth is on track to jump by $1.4bn (\u00a31bn) as he heads to the White House, after the value of his technology company soared. Shares in Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), the owner of the social media platform Truth Social, climbed 35pc in the wake of early voting data that suggests the Republican is on track to win the US election. Mr Trump owns a 58.9pc stake in Truth Social that is now worth $5bn. The stake is believed to make up the majority of his net worth. Read how its valuation has swung wildly since its float . 11:21 AM GMT US borrowing costs rise at fastest pace since pandemic The cost of long-term borrowing in the US has jumped at its fastest pace since the 2020 amid expectations that Donald Trump\u2019s presidency will increase the American national debt. The yield on 30-year US Treasuries has risen 23 basis points to 4.67pc. 11:14 AM GMT Winners and losers on markets after Trump win Donald Trump\u2019s rapid confirmation as the next US president propelled the dollar higher and as investors bet on tariffs on imports and tax cuts that could benefit American business. US stock markets rallied almost by the most in a year in premarket trading, while the dollar was set for its largest one-day jump since 2022. Bitcoin hit record highs and Treasuries were battered in the bond markets. Mr Trump\u2019s pledges to raise tariffs, cut taxes and slash regulations encouraged investors to dive into a range of assets that looked likely to benefit from such policies. Markets that could suffer under tougher tariffs, including those in some of the United States\u2019 major trading partners, bore the brunt of the sell-off. The Mexican peso fell to its lowest in over two years, while the euro was set for its largest one-day drop since March 2020. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, said: \u201cIt\u2019s extremely early days to be drawing conclusions about what a Trump presidency and potential clean sweep might mean for the US and global economy and financial markets. \u201cCertainly, higher tariffs would involve greater inflation and less world trade growth. \u201cWith stocks, one of the primary drivers is Trump\u2019s promise to reduce corporate taxes for companies that make goods in America. \u201cAnd obviously, we\u2019ve seen a bit increase in US stock futures and that\u2019s carried through to European markets as well.\u201d 10:45 AM GMT Trump\u2019s victory on track to net Elon Musk $15bn Elon Musk is on track to net about $15bn (\u00a311.6bn) from Donald Trump\u2019s US election victory as investors scrambled to put in place so-called \u201cTrump trades\u201d linked to the expected US election winner\u2019s policies. Tesla\u2019s share price jumped as much as 14pc in premarket trading, which would add about $113bn to its valuation, taking its total market capitalisation to nearly $900bn. Chief executive Elon Musk has been a prominent supporter of the Republican candidate in the presidential race and is expected to become a prominent adviser to the presumptive President Elect. He supports Mr Trump\u2019s plans to loosen regulations which he thinks have held back the expansion of his SpaceX and self-driving taxis. 10:41 AM GMT Oil slumps as Trump heads for White House The price of oil has fallen as Donald Trump\u2019s expected victory in the US election sent the value of the dollar surging. Brent crude, the international benchmark, was down 1.4pc at $74 a barrel after the Republican candidate won the crucial swing states needed to clinch the race for the White House. Oil prices are measured in dollars, and an increase in the value of the US currency makes it cheaper to buy crude. The dollar has risen amid expectations that Mr Trump will impose tariffs on imports, which will likely increase inflation and force the US Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher for longer. He has also said he will increase production of oil in the US. Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, said: \u201cOil is falling as Trump promises to pump more oil, which will exacerbate the over supply in the oil market for the longer term.\u201d 10:25 AM GMT Ukraine bonds surge after Trump victory Investors have raced to buy Ukrainian sovereign bonds amid hopes that the election of Donald Trump will lead to a swift end to its war with Russia. Kyiv\u2019s dollar-denominated bonds jumped by the most of any emerging market debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Analysts think it could be a signal that the conflict in Ukraine could come to an end. Mr Trump has pledged to end the war \u201cwithin three days\u201d of taking office. 10:04 AM GMT Global markets \u2018reacting aggressively\u2019 to Trump win Global financial markets have reacted \u201caggressively\u201d to Donald Trump\u2019s expected election for a second time as US president. Saxo\u2019s head of commodity strategy Ole Hansen said: \u201cThis outcome is close to forming a \u201cTrump 2.0\u201d or a \u201cRed Sweep,\u201d where the Republicans could control both the White House and Congress, giving them substantial leverage in upcoming high-stakes tax and spending negotiations. \u201cSo far, the results have driven the dollar to a one-year high, with the currencies suffering the biggest setbacks being the Mexican peso, the Japanese yen, and the euro, the two former affected by the potential divergence between the rate path of the FOMC and other major central banks. \u201cThe US yield curve has bear-steepened, with long-term yields rising more quickly than short-term yields, as concerns grow that Trump\u2019s unfunded tax cuts and tariffs on imports might reignite inflation fears, potentially slowing the pace and depth of future US rate cuts.\u201d 09:54 AM GMT US government borrowing costs rise as Trump on track for victory In the debt market, US government borrowing costs have surged. Treasury yields shot to four-month highs. Yields on 10-year Treasury bonds - the return the government promises to pay buyers of its debt - jumped to 4.47pc, breaking last week\u2019s top of 4.39pc, Two-year yields climbed to 4.31pc from 4.19pc amid expectations that Mr Trump will enact more inflationary policies. Mark Haefele of UBS said the jump in yields was \u201cin anticipation of higher nominal GDP growth and higher fiscal deficits\u201d. However, government borrowing costs fell in Europe as investors snapped up bonds amid concerns that Mr Trump\u2019s inflationary tariffs will hurt growth. The yields on UK, German and French bonds were all lower, with the gap between US and European debt costs widening. 09:41 AM GMT US facing stocks rise on FTSE 100 The biggest gainers on the FTSE 100 appear to be US facing stocks, with Ashtead leading gains. The international building equipment rental company, which has strong operations in the US, was up 6.8pc. InterContinental Hotels was up 5.7pc, while gambling giant Entain, which has expanded its American operations, was up 4.9pc. 09:09 AM GMT Tesla shares surge as Trump trade takes over markets Tesla shares surged as much as 12pc in premarket trading, as investors scramble to put in place so called \u201cTrump trades\u201d linked to the expected US election winner\u2019s policies. The electric car maker\u2019s chief executive Elon Musk has been a prominent supporter of the Republican candidate in the presidential race. He supports Mr Trump\u2019s plans to loosen regulations which he thinks have held back the expansion of his SpaceX and self-driving taxis. 08:58 AM GMT Clean energy shares sink as Trump prepares to scrap offshore wind projects Shares in European clean energy groups plummeted as Donald Trump claimed victory in the US presidential election. The world\u2019s largest offshore wind developer Orsted fell 9.5pc while wind turbine makers Vestas and Nordex traded down 8.7pc and 3.4pc, respectively. Trump has vowed to scrap offshore wind projects through an executive order on his first day in office. The Republicans have taken control of at least one chamber of Congress and could take both. Shares in German utility RWE, which also has wind assets, fell 2.3pc, while Portugal\u2019s EDP Renovaveis traded 6.8pc lower.

In corporate news, Marks & Spencer surged by 4pc after it notched up a better-than-expected jump in half-year profits thanks to buoyant food and clothing trading. Pub group Wetherspoons was up 2pc after sales grew about 6pc in the 14 weeks to November 3, compared with the same period last year. Boss Tim Martin said this marked \u201crecord\u201d sales for the first quarter of the group\u2019s financial year. However, Persimmons sank by 5pc to drop to the bottom of the FTSE 100 after it warned it faced rising cost inflation and the impact of new building regulations and National Insurance increases announced in the Budget. 08:22 AM GMT Starmer congratulates Trump on \u2018historic election victory\u2019 Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has congratulated Donald Trump on his \u201chistoric election victory\u201d and said that \u201cas the closest of allies, we stand shoulder to shoulder in defence of our shared values of freedom, democracy and enterprise\u201d. 08:17 AM GMT How Europe is preparing for \u2018cold shower\u2019 of second Trump presidency At the European Commission headquarters, the \u201cTrump task force\u201d is hard at work drawing up contingency plans for a US-EU trade war and Washington cancelling aid for Ukraine .

Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Finalto, pointed to surging markets on Wall Street, with the Russel 2000 index of smaller companies surging by 4pc to the highest in three years in premarket trading. He added that the winners from the election night would be Elon Musk, Tesla, bitcoin and the dollar, while the losers would be China, left-wing European governments,\u00a0emerging market currencies and tariff-exposed stocks. He said: \u201cStocks are probably less sensitive to the Trump Trade than the FX space and this has been borne out so far \u2013 a lot more orderly than 2016 \u2013 partly because Trump is known and partly because it was not a surprise!\u201d 07:52 AM GMT Trump win is \u2018bad news for Europe\u2019 Donald Trump winning the US election \u201cwill adversely affect growth in Europe\u201d as the Republican candidate is expected to put in place tariffs on imports, analysts have warned. Andrzej Szczepaniak of Nomura said: \u201cThe European Commission is expected to retaliate like-for-like, which could mean higher inflation in the euro area \u2013 or, as manufacturing firms\u2019 pricing power is so diminished, as we have been flagging for some time, firms could be forced to absorb these higher costs, which in turn may result in some firms shuttering and unemployment rising, thus weighing more heavily on growth.\u201d He added that the European Cental Bank would likely remain \u201cvery cautious\u201d and refrain from a larger half a percentage point interest rate cut in December. 07:46 AM GMT US stocks surge as Trump says Harris has \u2018no path\u2019 to victory US stock markets are extending their huge gains in premarket trading after Donald Trump declared victory in the 2024 US presidential race.

The question appears to be whether there is a \u201cred sweep\u201d whereby the Republicans win control of the White House, the House of Representatives and the Senate. Deutsche Bank analyst Jim Reid said: \u201cOne thing to consider is that if there is a split Congress, you could argue that tariff policy becomes the priority assuming Trump wins, as he won\u2019t be able to get his tax policy through without negotiations.\u201d 07:21 AM GMT Trump\u2019s wealth surges $400m as he leads US election race Donald Trump\u2019s wealth is on track to surge by about $400m after shares in his social media platform rose in the wake of his expected election victory.
