Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 3:00 PM 23 min read In This Article: ELRRF +1.35% Eloro Resources Ltd. Tin mineralization is hosted in an extensive intrusion breccia unit (TIB) that is approximately 750m long by 450m wide and extends to a depth of at least 700m. Previous wide space reconnaissance drilling has intersected a number of significant Sn intersections in this breccia unit which is very under-drilled High grade tin mineralization in Hole DSB-72 reported here occurs as visible coarse-grained high temperature cassiterite which is likely to be amenable to gravity separation. Core from this hole will be used for additional metallurgical testing. Geophysically, the intrusion breccia has low chargeability which contrasts considerably with the adjacent later epithermal Ag-Zn-Pb mineralization which is marked by a strong chargeability anomaly. The intrusive breccia is very likely an offshoot or apophysis from a large tin porphyry at depth. The likely top of this tin porphyry is marked by a highly conductive zone that is interpreted as a pyrite-pyrrhotite halo around this porphyry. Similar pyritic halos have been reported from other major tin deposits in the Bolivian Tin Belt. With this discovery of a presumed shallow level apophysis of a tin porphyry at depth, Eloro is in a unique position of having two discernable different deposit styles juxtaposed against one another; a very large silver-zinc-lead dominant system next to a high-grade tin system. While these two systems are likely genetically related, this means that the Company may potentially have two world class deposits on the same property. TORONTO, Jan. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eloro Resources Ltd. (TSX: ELO; OTCQX: ELRRF; FSE: P2QM) (\u201cEloro\u201d, or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is pleased to announce further assay results from its definition diamond drilling program in the potential Santa Barbara starter pit area in the Iska Iska silver-tin polymetallic project in the Potosi Department of southwestern Bolivia. To date 5145.8m of diamond drilling have been completed in ten (10) holes. PQ core size has been used for all holes in this program to obtain larger, more representative core samples. Hole DSB-72 is the first hole completed into the tin domain. Table 1 below lists significant results for this hole and Figure 1 shows locations of all the definition drill holes completed to date and in progress. Silver equivalent values (g Ag eq/t) have been calculated using 3-year average metal prices and preliminary metallurgical recoveries (see note below Table 1 for more information). Table 2 lists the coordinates of the drill holes completed and in progress. Hole DSB-72, collared 160m southwest of previously reported drill hole DSB-69 (see Eloro press release of January 6, 2025) returned a long high grade tin intersection grading 1.39% Sn over 33m from 339.80m to 372.80m within 0.74% Sn over 87m from 291.8m to 378.8m. The higher grade zone displays cassiterite veins within well mineralized breccia; individual 1.5m long samples encompassing veins returned values of 6.65%Sn, 4.97%Sn, 3.50% Sn and 2.75%Sn. Notably, in the upper part of this hole, higher grade silver mineralization of 24.48 g Ag/t over 45.0m was intersected from 117.80m to 162.80m. Story Continues During the early stages of the reconnaissance exploration drilling program at Iska Iska, significant wide spaced tin intersections were reported as summarized in Table 2; the most notable being 0.43% Sn over 73.29m in hole DSB-06, 1.18% Sn over 11.52m in hole DSB-17, 0.25% Sn over 82.11m in hole DSB-25 and 1.41% over 21.25m including 3.08% Sn over 9.04m in hole DSB-33 (see Eloro press releases \u2013 April 12, 2021, September 20, 2022 and October 5, 2022). All of these intersections are now recognized to be in the intrusion breccia (TIB) unit. Locations of these drill holes pierce points are shown in Figure 2, a longitudinal section showing distribution of chargeability. The intrusion breccia has low chargeability which contrasts considerably with the adjacent later epithermal Ag-Zn-Pb mineralization which is marked by a strong chargeability anomaly. Tin mineralization is hosted in an extensive intrusion breccia unit (TIB) that is approximately 750m long by 450m wide and extends to a depth of least 700m. Previous wide space reconnaissance drilling has intersected a number of significant Sn intersections (see Table 3 below) in this breccia unit which is very under-drilled. High grade tin mineralization in Hole DSB-72 occurs as visible coarse-grained high temperature cassiterite which is likely to be amenable to gravity separation. Core from this hole will be used for additional metallurgical testing. The intrusive breccia is very likely an offshoot or apophysis from a large tin porphyry at depth. The likely top of this tin porphyry is marked by a highly conductive zone that is interpreted as a likely pyrite-pyrrhotite halo around this porphyry. Similar pyritic halos have been reported from other major tin deposits in the Bolivian Tin Belt. Dr. Osvaldo Arce, P.Geo., Eloro\u2019s Executive Vice President, Latin America and General Manager of Eloro\u2019s Bolivian subsidiary, Minera Tupiza S.R.L., said: \u201cOur understanding of the immense mineralizing system at Iska Iska continues to advance leading to the very targeted definition drill program which is producing very good results and continuing to expand resource potential. Areas with significant tin mineralization occur where mineralizing fluids were deposited through intrusion breccias and injection tourmaline breccias in favorable lithologies and structures forming enriched bodies with\u00a0significant\u00a0resource potential.\u201d Dr. Arce continued: \u201cBolivia, since the early 1900s, has been a global tin producer, presently ranked as the world\u2019s fourth largest tin producer, together with other metals including silver, zinc, antimony, and lithium. Tin has been produced for over 100 years. The tin deposits are mainly located in the Bolivian Tin Belt that extends over 1,000 km in length making it one of the largest tin metallogenic belts worldwide. In 2019, this belt accounted for approximately 6% of global tin production, 5% of silver and 1.5% of tungsten (USGS 2020).\u201d He further commented: \u201cSome of the most outstanding deposits are named as \u201cBolivian-type\u201d polymetallic veins and classified as \"giant \u201d, such as Cerro Rico de Potos\u00ed (Ag, Sn), Llallagua (Sn), Chorolque (Sn), and the Peruvian San Rafael (Cu-Sn) mine. These deposits are large, mineralized masses as combinations of veins, veinlets, stockworks, and disseminations. Llallagua is the largest vein-type tin deposit in Bolivia and one of the largest in the world, where total production has been estimated at more than one million tonnes of tin. Chorolque, located 30km north of Iska Iska contains extensive tin mineralization grading 0.3-0.5% Sn, hosted mostly in intrusion and intrusive breccias in rhyodacite intrusion. The San Rafael underground tin mine in Peru, located in the northern extension of the Bolivian tin belt, where approximately 12% of the world's tin is produced, is one of the world's richest hydrothermal tin Iodes. In these deposits, large-scale, structurally complex, cassiterite-bearing hydrothermal veins (\u201ctin Iodes)\u201d are commonly characterized by high grade tin (1-5 % Sn), and most of these deposits have been reported to contain in excess of 1,000 tonnes Sn, with some hosting greater than 50,000 tonnes Sn.\u201d Dr. Bill Pearson, P.Geo., Executive Vice President, Exploration noted: \u201cThe specific mineralized domains at Iska Iska, i.e. an earlier Sn-Ag porphyry system followed by a later Ag-Zn-Pb high sulphidation epithermal event, are readily evident in the chargeability section shown in Figure 2 below. The recognition of the extensive intrusion breccia unit (TIB) which was only marginally drilled previously is a major step forward in focussing further exploration drilling, especially for tin. Our goal continues to be to upgrade and expand the mineral resource at Iska Iska to form the basis for the planned PEA. The more we drill, however, the more we expand this remarkable mineralized system which has yet to be completely defined in any dimension.\u201d Table 1: Definition Diamond Drill Results as of January 23, 2025, Santa Barbara, Iska, Iska SANTA BARBARA DEFINITION DIAMOND DRILL RESULTS Hole No. From (m) To (m) Length (m) Ag Zn Pb Sn Ag eq g/t % % % g/t DSB-72 38.30 65.30 27.00 6.84 0.00 0.01 0.34 73.01 84.80 96.80 12.00 8.20 0.00 0.06 0.17 42.52 117.80 162.80 45.00 24.48 0.02 0.04 0.12 46.12 192.80 194.30 1.50 33.30 0.00 0.38 1.97 422.20 209.30 213.80 4.50 4.60 0.00 0.02 0.24 51.04 245.30 249.80 4.50 16.70 0.00 0.32 0.20 61.56 291.80 378.80 87.00 2.62 0.00 0.03 0.74 147.41 Incl. 339.80 372.80 33.00 3.49 0.00 0.08 1.39 275.12 425.30 428.30 3.00 0.30 0.01 0.00 0.32 62.09 434.30 435.80 1.50 1.40 0.01 0.01 0.59 116.64 606.80 622.55 15.75 3.70 0.02 0.07 0.17 39.19 Note: True width is approximately 80% of core length.

Eloro utilized both ALS and AHK for drill core analyses, both of whom are major international accredited laboratories. Drill samples sent to ALS were prepared in both ALS\u00a0Bolivia Ltda\u2019s preparation facility in Oruro, Bolivia and the preparation facility operated by AHK in Tupiza with pulps sent to the main ALS Global laboratory in Lima for analysis. Eloro employs an industry standard QA/QC program with standards, blanks and duplicates inserted into each batch of samples analyzed with selected check samples sent to a separate accredited laboratory. Drill core samples sent to AHK Laboratories were prepared in a preparation facility installed and managed by AHK in Tupiza with pulps sent to the AHK laboratory in Lima, Peru. Check samples between ALS and AHK are regularly done as a QA/QC check. AHK is followed the same analytical protocols used as with ALS and with the same QA/QC protocols. About Iska Iska The Iska Iska silver-tin polymetallic project is a road accessible, royalty-free property, wholly controlled by the Title Holder, Empresa Minera Villegas S.R.L. and is located 48 km north of Tupiza city, in the Sud Chichas Province of the Department of Potosi in southern Bolivia. Eloro has an option to earn a 100% interest in Iska Iska. Iska Iska is a major silver-tin polymetallic porphyry-epithermal complex associated with a Miocene possibly collapsed/resurgent caldera, emplaced on Ordovician age rocks with major breccia pipes, dacitic domes and hydrothermal breccias. The caldera is 1.6km by 1.8km in dimension with a vertical extent of at least 1km. Mineralization age is similar to Cerro Rico de Potos\u00ed and other major deposits such as San Vicente, Chorolque, Tasna and Tatasi, all located along the same overall geological trend. Eloro began underground diamond drilling from the Huayra Kasa underground workings at Iska Iska on September 13, 2020. On November 18, 2020, Eloro announced the discovery of a significant breccia pipe with extensive silver polymetallic mineralization just east of the Huayra Kasa underground workings and a high-grade gold-bismuth zone in the underground workings. On November 24, 2020, Eloro announced the discovery of the Santa Barbara Breccia Pipe (SBBP) approximately 150m southwest of the Huayra Kasa underground workings. Subsequently, on January 26, 2021, Eloro announced significant results from the first drilling at the SBBP including the discovery hole from 0.0m to 257.5m. Subsequent drilling has confirmed the presence of significant values of Ag-Sn polymetallic mineralization in the SBBP and the adjacent Central Breccia Pipe (CBP). A substantive mineralized envelope which is open along strike and down-dip extends around both major breccia pipes. Continuous channel sampling along the walls of the Santa Barbara Adit located to the east of SBBP returned average grades of 164.96 g Ag/t, 0.46%Sn, 3.46% Pb and 0.14% Cu over 166m including 446 g Ag/t, 9.03% Pb and 1.16% Sn over 56.19m. The west end of the adit intersects the end of the SBBP. Since the initial discovery hole DHK-15 which returned 29.53g Ag/t, 0.078g Au/t, 1.45%Zn, 0.59%Pb, 0.080%Cu and 0.056%Sn over 257.5m, Eloro has released a number of significant drill results in the SBBP and the surrounding mineralized envelope which, along with geophysical data, has defined an extensive target zone. On October 17, 2023, Eloro filed the NI 43-101 Technical Report outlining the initial inferred MRE for Iska Iska, prepared by independent consultants Micon International Limited. The MRE was reported in two domains, the Polymetallic (Ag-Zn-Pb) Domain which is primarily in the east and south of the Santa Barbara deposit and the Tin (Sn-Ag-Pb) Domain which is primarily in the west and north. The Polymetallic Domain is estimated to contain 560Mt at 13.8 g Ag/t, 0.73% Zn & 0.28% Pb at an NSR cutoff of US$9.20 for potential open pit and an NSR cutoff of US$34.40 for potential underground. The majority of the mineral resource is contained in the constraining pit which has a stripping ratio of 1:1. The Polymetallic Domain contains a higher-grade mineral resource at a NSR cutoff of $US25/t of 132 million tonnes at 1.11% Zn, 0.50% Pb and 24.3 g Ag/t which has a net NSR value of US$34.40/t which is 3.75 the estimated operating cost of US$9.20/t. The Tin Domain which is adjacent to the Polymetallic Domain and does not overlap, is estimated to contain a mineral resource of 110Mt at 0.12% Sn, 14.2 g Ag/t and 0.14% Pb but is very under drilled. Results of the definition drill program which totalled 5,267.7m in 11 holes were reported on December 18, 2023 and January 11, 2024, respectively. Significant results included 279.22 g Ag/t, 0.47% Pb and 0.43% Sn (339.82g Ag eq/t) over 62.84m and 33.83 g Ag/t, 1.53% Zn, 0.93% Pb and 0.14% Sn (130.88g Ag eq/t) over 178.99m\u00a0including\u00a0120.37 g Ag/t, 2.13% Zn, 1.57% Pb\u00a0and\u00a00.19% Sn in hole DSB-61; 57.62g Ag/t, 1.26% Zn, 0.94% Pb and 0.12% Sn (139.94g Ag eq/t) over 136.11m in hole DSB-66 and 118.86g Ag/t, 0.35% Zn, 0.35% Pb and 0.15% Sn (152.29g Ag eq/t) over 81.28m in hole DSB-65. This latter intersection in hole DSB-65 included a very high-grade sample of 5,080g Ag/t, 0.12 g Au/t, 0.26% Zn, 1.34% Pb, 1.53% Cu and 1.27% Sn (4,746.46g Ag eq/t) over 1.46m. Metallurgical tests reported on January 23, 2024 from a 6.3 tonne PQ drill core bulk sample representative of the higher grade Polymetallic (Ag-Zn-Pb) Domain returned a significantly higher average silver value of 91 g Ag/t compared to the weighted average grade of the original twinned holes at 31 g Ag/t strongly suggesting that the average silver grade is likely significantly underreported in the original twinned holes due to the much smaller sample size. On January 29, 2024, the Company reported that the new chargeability high outlined southeast of the MRE open pit by the expanded induced polarization (IP) survey indicates that the major mineralized structural corridor that is up to 800m wide extends a further 600m along strike to the southeast for an overall strike length of at least 2km. This new area has not been drilled. The Company reported on July 30, 2024, that updated modelling of the potential starter pit area at Santa Barbara zone highlights the importance of completing additional drilling to better define the grade and extent of the mineral resource in this area. Areas with higher-grade resource typically have much better drilling density but holes outside the core potential pit area are too widely spaced to give an accurate estimate of grade. On September 4, 2024, the Company announced the restart of definition drilling in the potential starter pit area at Santa Barbara. Previous drilling has shown that areas with high-grade mineralization typically have much better drilling density, whereas holes outside the core area are too widely spaced to give an accurate grade estimate. This increased drilling density is particularly important for defining the extent of the high-grade Ag-bearing and Sn-bearing structures, and for categorizing the mineral resources from inferred to indicated, which have a major influence on overall grade and resources that will contribute to the preliminary economic assessment (\u201cPEA\u201d). An initial program of 5,700m of diamond drilling in 13 holes in the Santa Barbara starter pit area is now in progress to better define the vertical and lateral extent of high-grade Ag mineralization; fill-in gaps that are presently categorized as low-grade or waste in the resource model but are very likely mineralized; expand the higher-grade Sn mineralization to the west; and complete an additional 1,400m in two large size PQ holes for further metallurgical testing. Results from the first definition drill hole DSB-68 were released on November 26, 2024. This hole intersected 66.90g Ag/t, 0.63% Zn, 0.42% Pb and 0.11% Sn (111.14g Ag eq/t) over 289.13m including higher grade intervals of: 126.10g Ag/t, 0.55% Zn, 0.60% Pb and 0.09% Sn (160.72g Ag eq/t) over 122.03m, 47.61g Ag/t, 0.22% Zn, 0.40% Pb and 0.45% Sn (146.06g Ag eq/t) over 16.51m, and 25.52g Ag/t, 2.19% Zn, 0.65% Pb and 0.10% Sn (129.60g Ag eq/t) over 7.46m Further drill results were released on January 6, 2025: Hole DSB-69 intersected 127.49g Ag/t, 0.50% Zn, 0.16% Pb and 0.31% Sn (193.00g Ag eq/t) over 41.25m within a broader interval of 49.71g Ag/t, 0.78% Zn, 0.32% Pb and 0.15% Sn (106.97g Ag eq/t) over 142.50m. Hole DSB-70 intersected, 45.71g Ag/t, 3.11% Zn, 1.91% Pb and 0.23% Sn (232.35g Ag eq/t) over 81.00m within a broader interval of 30.08g Ag/t, 1.63% Zn 0.98% Pb and 0.13% Sn (127.89g Ag eq/t) over 255.75m Hole DSB-71 intersected 53.17 Ag/t, 0.72% Zn, 0.40% Pb and 0.19% Sn (116.62 g Ag eq/t) over 45.00m within a broader interval of 29.26 Ag/t, 0.58% Zn, 0.22% Pb and 0.11% Sn (71.46g Ag eq/t) over 127.50m.

(\"NGEx\", \"NGEx Minerals\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: NGEX) (OTCQX: NGXXF)\u00a0is pleased to provide the second update on its ongoing Phase 3 drill program at the 100% owned Lunahuasi high-grade copper-gold-silver project in San Juan, Argentina . Drilling started in mid-October 2024 , and six diamond drill rigs are currently working on the project. Due to positive initial results from the program, two additional drills are scheduled to be added in February, and the planned program has been expanded from 20,000m to 25,000m . View PDF This news release includes partial results received to date for five holes, as indicated in Table 2 below. Results from the upper parts of DPDH024 and DPDH025 were released on December 18, 2024 . A summary of assay intervals by news release date is included in Table 3. The highlighted intersections from this release, including notable gold values, are shown below, and individual metal grades and estimated true widths of all intersections are shown in Table 1. Updated drill program progress and collar locations are shown in Table 2. Highlights Drillhole DPDH024 intersected: 7.40m at 5.81% copper equivalent (\"CuEq\") from 715.00m Drillhole DPDH025 intersected: 29.80m at 4.80%\u00a0CuEq from 369.05m , including: 5.74m at 21.22%\u00a0CuEq from 372.45m (19.13 g/t gold) Drillhole DPDH026 intersected: 21.50m at 3.07%\u00a0CuEq from 529.20m , including: 2.40m at 17.47%\u00a0CuEq from 529.20m Drillhole DPDH028 intersected: 2.00m at 11.82%\u00a0CuEq from 230.10m (10.13 g/t gold) , plus: 205.35m at 5.08%\u00a0CuEq from 378.50m (3.20 g/t gold) , including: 51.10m at 13.84%\u00a0CuEq from 464.30m (9.70 g/t gold) , including .50m at 22.28%\u00a0CuEq from 467.50m (5.93 g/t gold) , and 8.20m at 35.84% CuEq from 504.10m (39.11 g/t gold) , plus 7.20m at 13.93%\u00a0CuEq from 542.50m Wojtek Wodzicki , President and CEO, commented, \"Lunahuasi continues to surprise to the upside and deliver some of the best copper-gold intercepts in the world. DPDH028 is a remarkable hole which is a significant step-out below previous drilling and includes the widest high-grade copper-gold intercept to date, with results for the final 1,000m of the hole still pending. Furthermore, it is becoming evident that Lunahuasi is also a very significant gold deposit with intervals and grades that rival those from known high-grade gold deposits. The deposit remains open in all directions and step-out drilling to expand the known zones and test for a porphyry source to the west remains a top priority. We are highly encouraged by the results to date and have decided to expand the program from 20,000m to 25,000m by adding two additional drill rigs which will bring the total to eight. The $175 million financing completed in October, 2024 provides full flexibility to adjust the program as results are received. With the drill program in full swing, we expect to be able to release a steady flow of results well into mid-year.\" Story Continues Hole ID From (m) To (m) Length (m) Estimated True Width (m) Cu % Au g/t Ag g/t CuEq % DPDH024 492.00 496.85 4.85 2.7 2.73 0.55 41.1 3.49 plus 513.10 522.30 9.20 5.2 2.43 0.97 29.2 3.39 plus 663.60 665.90 2.30 1.3 2.73 1.29 38.0 4.00 plus 715.00 722.40 7.40 4.1 2.44 2.39 184.7 5.81 DPDH025 326.50 333.50 7.00 5.1 2.51 1.90 21.1 4.08 plus 369.05 398.85 29.80 22 0.79 4.03 121.3 4.80 incl 372.45 378.19 5.74 4.2 1.92 19.13 608.0 21.22 plus 609.90 617.70 7.80 5.7 1.59 0.47 10.9 2.03 DPDH026 48.00 53.00 5.00 2.8 1.27 0.51 20.6 1.82 plus 210.00 215.50 5.50 3.0 1.23 3.25 36.2 3.92 plus 297.15 326.80 29.65 16 1.21 0.54 11.3 1.70 incl 321.30 324.20 2.90 1.6 6.39 1.37 54.4 7.87 plus 432.00 440.00 8.00 4.4 0.40 0.75 72.4 1.59 plus 476.53 481.00 4.47 2.5 1.97 1.24 21.5 3.06 plus 529.20 550.70 21.50 12 2.41 0.76 11.6 3.07 incl 529.20 531.60 2.40 1.3 14.83 3.22 33.5 17.47 DPDH027 385.60 401.00 15.40 10 0.50 0.88 19.0 1.30 DPDH028 181.80 187.00 5.20 3.9 0.58 2.16 30.7 2.42 plus 221.40 232.10 10.70 7.9 1.30 2.65 31.9 3.51 incl 230.10 232.10 2.00 1.5 3.63 10.13 91.2 11.82 plus 378.50 583.85 205.35 152 2.45 3.20 34.6 5.08 incl 439.60 549.70 110.10 81 4.23 5.61 57.0 8.82 incl 440.70 443.50 2.80 2.1 3.71 18.84 28.4 17.70 and incl 464.30 515.40 51.10 38 5.98 9.70 90.4 13.84 incl 467.50 471.00 3.50 2.6 16.59 5.93 155.7 22.28 incl 473.00 475.40 2.40 1.8 8.25 13.04 55.5 18.25 incl 485.70 486.90 1.20 1.0 24.98 21.60 701.0 46.90 incl 504.10 512.30 8.20 6.1 6.18 39.11 129.2 35.84 and incl 542.50 549.70 7.20 5.3 10.46 3.64 92.4 13.93 DPDH024 was collared from the same platform as DPDH014 and drilled at -58 degrees towards the west in order to test for an extension to the high-grade zone in hole 14 and for extensions to other mineralized structures to the north and at depth. The main zone in hole 14 appears to have been intersected over 12.3m from 139.8m to 152.0m (22.35% CuEq; 9.36% Cu, 18.16 g/t Au, 84.7 g/t Ag \u2013 see News Release from December 18, 2024 ). The hole went on to intersect several other structures including those noted in the Table 1. This hole has been completed and assays from 757.0m to the end of the hole at 968.0m are pending. DPDH025 was collared 50m to the north of hole 24, on the same platform as DPDH012 and drilled at -45 degrees towards the west to test for northern extensions to the mineralized structures. An intersection of 11.9m at 10.74% CuEq (8.00% Cu, 3.02 g/t Au, 61.4 g/t Ag - see News Release from December 18, 2024 ) is interpreted as the northern extension of the zone intersected in DPDH014 and is 105m away. A particularly strong intersection at 372.45m ( 5.74m at 21.22% CuEq) includes 19.13 g/t gold. This hole has been completed and assays from 652.0m to the end of the hole at 1,303.8m are pending. DPDH026 was collared 216m to the east of DPDH014 and drilled towards the west at -60 degrees to test for the down-dip extension of the mineralized structures. Several structures were intersected as shown in Table 1. All intersections above 400m depth appear to be new structures which lie to the east of anything intersected by previous drilling. This hole has been completed and assays from 553.0m to the end of the hole at 1,261.2m are pending. DPDH027 was collared from the same platform as DPDH021, which was the southernmost hole prior to this season's program, and drilled at -46 degrees towards the WSW (226 degrees) in order to test for a southern extension to the numerous mineralized structures seen in DPDH021. Only a few weakly mineralized structures are indicated by the assay results received so far, but assays from 459.0m to the end of the hole at 1,192.0m are pending. This hole is still in progress. DPDH028 was collared from the same platform as DPDH022 and drilled towards the west at -53 degrees in order to undercut hole 22 and test the down-dip extension of the structures intersected by it. A major structure intersected from 378.5m in this hole correlates well with a similar interval in DPDH022 from 380.0m . In both holes this zone is characterized by very high grades, especially with respect to gold, including a 8.2m interval at 39.11 g/t gold with a best sample of 1.5m at 115.00 g/t gold in DPDH028 and two samples over 70 g/t gold within a 38.9m interval at 10.09 g/t from 408.0m in DPDH022. This very high-grade zone also correlates well with an intersection 120m away to the south in DPDH021 of 4.8m at 24.34 g/t gold from 480.5m (see News Release dated June 9, 2024 ). This hole has been completed and assays from 588.0m to the end of the hole at 1,600.4m are pending. Six drill rigs are currently turning at Lunahuasi with five holes completed and just over 9,500m drilled, the details of which are presented in Table 2. Details of assay intervals completed by news release date are presented in Table 3. Additional intersections will be released once assays are received, analyzed, and confirmed by the Company.

Mr. Carmichael is Vice President, Exploration for the Company. Samples were cut at NGEx's operations base in San Juan, Argentina by Company personnel. Diamond drill core was sawed and then sampled in maximum 2-meter intervals, stopping at geological boundaries. Core diameter is a mix of PQ, HQ and NQ depending on the depth of the drill hole. Samples were bagged, tagged and packaged for shipment by truck to the ALS preparation laboratory in Mendoza, Argentina where they were crushed and a 500g split was pulverized to 85% passing 200 mesh. The prepared sample splits were sent to the ALS assay laboratory in either Lima, Peru or Santiago, Chile for copper, gold and silver assays, and multi-element ICP. ALS is an accredited laboratory which is independent of the Company. Gold assays were by fire assay fusion with AAS finish on a 30g sample. Copper and silver were assayed by atomic absorption following a 4-acid digestion. Samples were also analyzed for a suite of 48 elements with ME-MS61 plus mercury. Copper and gold standards as well as blanks and duplicates (field, preparation, and analysis) were randomly inserted into the sampling sequence for Quality Control. On average, 9% of the submitted samples are Quality Control samples. No data quality problems were indicated by the QA/QC program. Copper equivalent (CuEq) for drill intersections is calculated based on US$3.00 /lb Cu, US$1,500 /oz Au and US$18 /oz Ag, with 80% metallurgical recoveries assumed for all metals. The formula is: CuEq % = Cu % + (0.7292 * Au g/t) + (0.0088 * Ag g/t). True widths are rounded to the nearest metre for widths over 10 m and to the nearest 0.1 m for widths less than 10 m , as this better reflects the precision of the estimates. True widths should be regarded as approximate as these are derived from an estimation that uses a preliminary interpretation of the geological model and are subject to change as more information becomes available. Core scanning and integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into our core logging and geological interpretation processes is being implemented to improve workflows for more routine tasks and to give geologists more time for targeting and interpretation.

Intercepts Greater than 1% Newsfile Corp. Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 2:30 PM 14 min read In This Article: FDCFF -2.68% Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - January 21, 2025) - Forum Energy Metals Corp. (TSXV: FMC) (OTCQB: FDCFF) (\"Forum\" or the \"Company\") announces drill results for the Qavvik anomaly, its second basement hosted deposit located within Forum's 100% owned Aberdeen Project. This highly successful program intersected a 296-metre-wide zone of uranium mineralization with grades up to 8.2% U3O8 in a newly identified lense and resulted in more than 20 assays with grades greater than 1% U3O8. Mineralization is open to the northeast and southwest, and the shallow depths along with the thick overall uranium intercepts demonstrates the open pit potential of this deposit. With multiple drill targets on the property, the Aberdeen project has the potential to unfold into a generational uranium district. (Figure 1). HIGHLIGHTS QAV24-001 intersected a 296 m wide zone of uranium mineralization consisting of numerous discreet lenses from 36 m to 332 m, and QAV24-002 intersected over 190 m of discreet mineralized lenses from 192 m to 384 m. On the Qavvik Grid, uranium mineralization has been intersected over a 150 metre northeast-southwest trend and is open for extension of the deposit. The highest mineralization intervals from QAV24-001 are as follows: The highest mineralization intervals from QAV24-002 are as follows: Rick Mazur, CEO, commented, \"These exceptional results from our Qavvik deposit are in line with what we believe to exist in the Thelon Basin - basement and unconformity contact type deposits with the same size potential as the Athabasca Basin. With Tatiggaq only 5 km from Orano's 127 million pound Kiggavik uranium deposit and Qavvik demonstrating the potential for an economic resource, we believe that we are building a new tier one uranium district. The unconformity style alteration of the Thelon sandstone and basement rocks that has been observed at our Ned, Ayra and Loki drill targets provides even more growth potential for the project.\" Dr. Rebecca Hunter, Forum's VP, Exploration, stated, \"Going into 2024, it was our first opportunity as a company to showcase the size and grade potential of the Qavvik deposit. Our objective to drill at a shallower angle in order to intersect multiple lenses was highly successful both in terms of grade and size. The thick intersection in our first drill hole of several hundred metres of uranium mineralization is quite prolific. In addition, the high grades demonstrate tremendous potential for increasing the resource at Qavvik. We are very encouraged by these results and look forward to conducting more infill and expansion drilling at Qavvik.\" Story Continues QAVVIK DRILL PROGRAM - INFILL AND EXPANSION The Qavvik anomaly, hosts Forum's second deposit on the Aberdeen Project. The Aberdeen Project land package consists of approximately 95,000 ha or 950 square kilometres (365 square miles) of mineral claims in the Thelon Basin, located approximately 100 km west of Baker Lake. Qavvik is an 800mx800m gravity low 15 km west of the Tatiggaq deposit, which is adjacent to the 127 million pound Kiggavik project held by Orano/Denison/UEC*. The mineralization is hosted in steep-dipping structures as well as along flat-lying foliation planes within the host rock. The area has been tested by 28 historical holes by Cameco from 2009 to 2012. These holes were largely drilled on 25 to 50 m centres at an orientation of -85 degrees to the southeast. Another nine short holes drilled in the late 70's, early 80's by Marline Oil and Anaconda intersected alteration but no uranium. Forum completed two drill holes into the Qavvik anomaly in 2024 totaling 835 m (Table 1). The objective of QAV24-001 was to drill at a shallower angle in a more optimal direction to crosscut multiple lenses rather than the historical holes that drilled steeply along the mineralized lenses. The objective of QAV24-002 was to intersect and extend the main lower lense intersected in historical drilling. Both these tests were successful and will guide the expansion targeting in 2025. The structural setting of Qavvik is still being interpreted but the main controls on mineralization appear to be east-northeast subsidiary faults, and potentially a northeast fault that transects the area. The mineralization is open throughout the anomaly but in particular, to the northeast and southwest along these fertile east-northeast trending fault zones. QAV24-001 intersected mineralization over 296 m and the heart of this intercept includes over 0.12% U3O8 over 162.4 m from 170.0 to 332.4 m. Over 20 intercepts with greater than 1% U3O8 were identified in the drill hole and show the grade and size potential of this mineralized area. High-grade intercepts of 8.17% U3O8 over 0.5 m at 172.0 m, 7.92% U3O8 over 0.1 m at 292.3 m and 6.30% U3O8 over 0.2 m at 318.8 m are the highest grade intercepts intersected at Qavvik to date from all the historical drilling. Table 2 outlines the mineralized intercepts intersected in QAV24-001 and QAV24-002. Figure 2 is a plan map showing the 2024 drill holes and the gravity anomaly that is being tested. Figure 3 is a simplified cross section of QAV24-001 showing the extent of mineralization and the main geological units. Figure 4 is a core photograph of the high-grade lense intersected in QAV24-001.

This sampling program was used in the resampling program as well. The 2024 QA/QC program utilized control samples comprising certified reference materials (CRMs), duplicates, and blank samples. CRMs were used to monitor laboratory accuracy in the analysis of mineralized and non-mineralized samples, duplicate samples were used to monitor analytical precision and repeatability at the preparation and analytical stages, and blank samples were used to monitor for cross contamination during preparation and analytical stages. Control samples were inserted every 10 th sample, alternating between blank, duplicate, and uranium CRM. Duplicate samples alternated between field, coarse, and pulp duplicates. Three low grade uranium CRMs were alternated between: BL-4a (0.1248% U), DH-1a (0.2629% U), and BL-2a (0.426% U). A high-grade uranium CRM (BL-5; 7.09% U) was inserted into the sample sequence when counts exceeded 10,000 cps. Blanks and duplicates were inserted at a rate of 1-in-20 in non-mineralized holes. For mineralized holes, blanks, duplicates, and uranium CRMs were inserted at a rate of 1-in-30. In addition to Forum's QA/QC program, SRC Geoanalytical Laboratories (SRC) conducted an independent QA/QC program, and its laboratory repeats, non-radioactive laboratory standards (BSL18, BSM, BSH, DCB01), and radioactive lab standards (BL2A, BL4A, BL5, and SRCU02) were monitored and tracked by Forum staff. For the resampling program the original sample intervals were identified from markers that still were present on the core boxes and quarter split samples were obtained from the remaining half split core that remained in the core boxes. The core was weathered and broken down in places due to the strong clay content in much of the mineralized intervals but it did not appear that any core was missing and it was in otherwise good condition. ASSAYING AND ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES Composite, Spot, and Assay samples were shipped to the ISO/IEC 17025: 2005 accredited SRC Geoanalytical Laboratories in Saskatoon for sample preparation and analysis. Non-mineralized systematic and spot samples are dried, crushed, and pulverized for analysis by the ICP-MS Exploration Package for sandstone and basement (codes ICP-MS1 and ICP-MS2 respectively). This analytical package consists of three separate analyses of inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) on the partial and total digestions of an aliquot of sample pulp material. Partial digestion is completed via nitric and hydrochloric acids and total digestion is completed via hydrofluoric, nitric, and perchloric acids. The SRC implements several instrumental and analytical quality control procedures for this analytical package. Instrumental checks comprise two calibration checks and two calibration standards. Analytical quality control consists of one blank, two reference materials, and one pulp replicate (duplicate) in each group of 40 samples. Samples with radioactivity over 500 CPS and indicated as assay samples were analysed using the ICP-MS Exploration Package (ICP-MS), ICP-OES (ICP1), and U 3 O 8 Assay (U 3 O 8 wt% Assay). The sample preparation procedures for ICP-MS and ICP1 are the same, and the U 3 O 8 wt% assay uses an aliquot of sample pulp digested in hydrochloric and nitric acid followed by ICP-OES finish. This method is capable of detecting as low as 0.001 weight percent (wt%) U 3 O 8 . All Assay samples were also analysed for gold by fire assay using aqua regia with ICP-OES finish. Boron analysis was conducted on all sample types and is completed by fusing an aliquot of sample pulp in a mixture of Na 2 O 2 and NaCO 3 , followed by ICP-OES. The SRC inserts a blank, an in-house reference material, and a replicate sample with each batch for analytical quality control and uses a 1000 ppm B commercial certified solution for equipment calibration. DOWNHOLE RADIOMETRIC PROBING METHOD Of the 30 holes completed in 2024,18 were successfully radiometrically logged using a 2GHF-1000 Triple Gamma downhole probe sourced from Terraplus in Ontario, Canada. The probe measures natural gamma radiation every 10 cm along the length of the drill hole. The total count NaI, which reports in count per second, may not be directly or uniformly related to uranium grades and are only an indication of the presence of radioactive minerals. *Source: The Kiggavik deposit is held by Orano (66.2%), Denison (16.9%) and Uranium Energy Corp.

Story Continues Shane Williams, President & CEO, stated, \u201cAs the site operational team advances test mining and stockpiles the bulk sample, the two underground drills continue to turn and continue to intercept broad zones of high-grade gold mineralization. The McVeigh zone is a shallow and easily accessible portion of the Madsen deposit and will be a key focus area during early phases of mining. The tight spaced drilling we are completing at McVeigh coupled with our enhanced geologic model and understanding of the structural controls will enable the engineering team to produce a very robust and high confidence mine plan that will reduce both external and internal dilution during mining.\u201d Plan maps and section for the Austin and McVeigh drilling outlined in this release are provided in Figures 1 through 16.

Upon completion of the Connection Drift, it will be accessed via the East Portal. Like the other mineralized domains that comprise the Madsen Mine, the McVeigh structures are hosted within broad, kilometer-scale planar alteration and deformation corridors that have been repeatedly reactivated during gold mineralization and subsequent deformation and metamorphism. At the deposit scale the Austin, South Austin, North Austin, and McVeigh Zones are locally folded and structurally dismembered by transposition and rotation into the penetrative S2 Foliation. In addition to this intense deformation overprint, the mineralized veins and alteration have been subjected to the relatively high temperatures of amphibolite facies metamorphism, which led to extensive recrystallization and growth of the skarn-like replacement mineral assemblage of diopside-amphibole-quartz-biotite. All significant gold mineralization on the mine property is demonstrably early relative to the most significant, penetrative deformation (D2) and metamorphic events. The North Austin Zone displays \u2018mine-style\u2019 alteration and mineralization and consists of multiple mineralized domains defined over a strike length of 0.5km. Mineralization remains open at depth and along strike to the northeast. In drill core, or at underground face exposures, gold-bearing zones at the Madsen Mine are best identified visually by fine (sub-millimetre) grains of free gold within strong alteration and veining. All high-grade intervals generally contain visible gold on drill core exteriors, although numerous examples exist of high-grade assays where visible gold was only identified within the interior (cut surface) of the core samples. Apart from the presence of free gold, pervasive silicification (locally accompanied by discrete quartz veining) and quartz-carbonate or diopside veining are the best indicators that a given interval is within a high-grade zone along/within the mineralized structure. The current underground drilling program at the Madsen Mine is focused on further definition of near-term mining inventory, as well as growth of the current mineral resource. Drilling has been focused on the more continuous and higher-grade portions of the Austin, South Austin, North Austin and McVeigh Zones. This will continue to be the strategy through 2025.

QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL Drilling completed underground at the Madsen Mine consists of BQ-sized diamond drill core for definition drill programs and oriented NQ-sized diamond drill core for exploration focused drilling. All drill holes are systematically logged, photographed, and sampled by a trained geologist at the Madsen Mine core processing facility. Minimum allowable sample length is 0.5m. Maximum allowable sample length is 1.5m. Control samples (certified standards and uncertified blanks), along duplicates, are inserted at a target 5% insertion rate. Results are assessed for accuracy, precision, and contamination on an ongoing basis. The BQ-sized drill core is whole core sampled. The NQ-sized drill core is then cut lengthwise utilizing a diamond blade core saw along a line pre-selected by the geologist. To reduce sampling bias, the same side of drill core is sampled consistently utilizing the orientation line as reference. For those samples containing visible gold (\u201cVG\u201d), a trained geologist supervises the cutting/bagging of those samples, and ensures the core saw blade is \u2018cleaned\u2019 with a dressing stone following the VG sample interval. Bagged samples are then sealed with zip ties and transported by Madsen Mine personnel directly to SGS Natural Resource\u2019s Facility in Red Lake, Ontario for assay. Samples are then prepped by SGS, which consists of drying at 105\u00b0C and crushing to 75% passing 2mm. A riffle splitter is then utilized to produce a 500g course reject for archive. The remainder of the sample is then pulverized to 85% passing 75 microns from which 50g is analyzed by fire assay and an atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) finish (SGS Code GO-FAA50V10). Samples returning gold values > 100 g/t Au are reanalyzed by fire assay with a gravimetric finish on a 50g sample (SGS Code GO_FAG50V). Samples with visible gold are also analyzed via metallic screen analysis (SGS code: GO_FAS50M). For multi-element analysis, samples are sent to SGS\u2019s facility in Burnaby, British Columbia and analyzed via four-acid digest with an atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) finish for 33-element analysis on 0.25g sample pulps (SGS code: GE_ICP40Q12). SGS Natural Resources analytical laboratories operates under a Quality Management System that complies with ISO/IEC 17025. The Madsen Mine deposit presently hosts a National Instrument 43-101 \u2013 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\u201cNI 43-101\u201d) Indicated resource of 1.65 million ounces (\u201cMoz\u201d) of gold grading 7.4 g/t Au and an Inferred resource of 0.37 Moz of gold grading 6.3 g/t Au. Mineral resources are estimated at a cut-off grade of 3.38 g/t Au and a gold price of US1,800/oz. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Please refer to the technical report entitled \u201cIndependent NI 43-101 Technical Report and Updated Mineral Resource Estimate for the PureGold Mine, Canada\u201d, prepared by SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. and dated June 16, 2023, and amended April 24, 2024 (the \u201c Madsen Report \u201d). The Madsen Resource Estimate has an effective date of December 31, 2021 and excludes depletion of mining activity during the period from January 1, 2022 to the mine closure on October 24, 2022 as it has been deemed immaterial and not relevant for the purpose of the Madsen Report.

at The Powerline Deposit, AurMac Property, Yukon Banyan Gold Corp. Thu, Jan 16, 2025, 3:07 PM 10 min read In This Article: BYAGF +2.30% Banyan Gold Corp . (the \" Company \" or \" Banyan \") ( TSXV:BYN )( OTCQB:BYAGF ) is pleased to announce analytical results from twenty-four (24) diamond drillholes collared within the Powerline Deposit located on the Company's AurMac Property , Yukon Territory. This set of holes targeted the western portion of the Powerline Deposit (See Figure 1) as part of the 2024 AurMac definition drilling program. Highlights from these most recent analytical results include: AX-24-551: 75.0 metres (\" m \") of 0.31 g/t Au from 102.6 m AX-24-561: 23.5 m of 1.06 g/t Au from 106.0 m AX-24-564: 45.7 m of 0.47 g/t Au from 96.2 m AX-24-575: 100.9 m of 0.31 g/t Au from 125.0 m AX-24-592: 48.8 m of 1.45 g/t Au from 70.1 m AX-24-595: 31.2 m of 0.68 g/t Au from 17.5 m AX-24-595: 39.7 m of 1.92 g/t Au from 72.3 m AX-24-596: 45.0 m of 0.53 g/t Au from 85.6 m AX-24-603: 48.5 m of 0.66 g/t Au from 96.3 m AX-24-610: 23.9 m of 0.84 g/t Au from 116.8 m AX-24-610: 18.6 m of 1.15 g/t Au from 158.9 m AX-24-618: 209.0 m of 0.63 g/t Au from 35.1 m \"These assay results continue to demonstrate consistent intervals of high-grade gold from the Powerline deposit,\" stated Tara Christie, President and CEO. \"We are confident that the 2024 diamond drilling program achieved its main goal; to define areas of on and near-surface gold grades above the deposit average gold value to support the Preliminary Economic Assessment study planned for Q4 2025.\" Summarized analytical results of these drillhole assays are presented in Table 1, collar locations in Table 2 and Figure 1 identifies drill collar locations, respectively. The Powerline Deposit is contained within a metasedimentary package which consists of predominately schists, quartzites and limestones of the Late Proterozoic to Cambrian age Hyland Group. Gold mineralization here is chiefly associated with low angle quartz-sulfosalt-arsenopyrite veins seen crosscutting all lithologies and is interpreted to be associated with a large intrusion related gold system typical of the Tombstone Gold Belt and Selwyn Basin gold deposits. Highlighted instances of visible gold identified from Banyan's logging of these drillholes are shown in Image 1. Image 1: Photographs of visible gold from: Figure 1:AurMac drillhole locations.

All core samples were split on-site at Banyan's core processing facilities. Once split, half samples were placed back in the core boxes with the other half of split samples sealed in poly bags with one part of a three-part sample tag inserted within. Samples were delivered by Banyan personnel or a dedicated expediter to the Bureau Veritas, Whitehorse preparatory laboratory where samples are prepared and then shipped to Bureau Veritas's Analytical laboratory in Vancouver, B.C., for pulverization and final chemical analysis. A robust system of standards, \u00bd core duplicates and blanks was implemented in the 2024 exploration drilling program and was monitored as chemical assay data became available.

About Banyan Banyan's primary asset, the AurMac Project is located in Canada's Yukon Territory. The current inferred Mineral Resource Estimate (\" MRE \") for the AurMac Project of 7.0 million ounces has an effective date of February 6, 2024. The 173 square kilometres (\" sq km \") AurMac Project lies 40 km from Mayo, Yukon. The AurMac Project is transected by the main Yukon highway and benefits from a 3-phase powerline, existing power station and cell phone coverage. Banyan has the right to earn up to a 100% interest, in both the Aurex and McQuesten Properties respectively, subject to certain royalties. The inferred MRE for the AurMac Project was prepared on February 6, 2024, and consisted of 7,003,000 ounces of gold (see Table 3) hosted within near surface, road accessible pit constrained Mineral Resources contained in two near/on-surface deposits: the Airstrip and Powerline Deposits. Table 3: Pit-Constrained Inferred Mineral Resources - AurMac Property Deposit Gold Cut-Off (g/t) Tonnage (Tonnes) Average Gold Grade (g/t) Contained Gold (oz.) Inferred Airstrip 0.30 35,243,000 0.75 845,000 Powerline 0.30 312,243,000 0.61 6,158,000 Total Combined 0.30 347,486,00 0.63 7,003,000 Notes : \u200e The effective date for the MRE is February 6, 2024, and was prepared by Marc Jutras, P.Eng., M.A.Sc., Principal, Ginto Consulting Inc., an independent Qualified Person in accordance with the requirements of NI43-101. The technical report supporting the Resource Estimate entitled \"AurMac Property, Mayo Mining District, Yukon Territory, Canada\" (the \"Technical Report\") has been filed on SEDAR at www.sedarplus.ca on March 18, 2024. Mineral Resources, which are not Mineral Reserves, do not have demonstrated economic viability. The estimate of Mineral Resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, sociopolitical, marketing, changes in global gold markets or other relevant issues. The CIM Definition Standards were followed for classification of Mineral Resources. The quantity and grade of reported Inferred Mineral Resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature \u200eand there has been insufficient exploration to define these Inferred Mineral Resources as an \u200eIndicated Mineral Resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to an \u200eIndicated or Measured Mineral Resource category. Mineral Resources are reported at a cut-off grade of 0.30 g/t gold for all deposits, using a US$/CAN$ exchange rate of 0.75 and constrained within an open pit shell optimized with the Lerchs-Grossman algorithm to constrain the Mineral Resources with the following estimated parameters: gold price of US$1,800/ounce, US$2.50/t mining cost, US$5.50/t processing cost, US$2.00/t G+A, 80% gold recoveries, and 45\u00b0 pit slopes. The number of tonnes and ounces was rounded to the nearest thousand. Any discrepancies in the totals are due to rounding effects; rounding followed the recommendations as per NI 43-101. In addition to the AurMac Property, the Company holds the Hyland Gold Project, located 70 km Northeast of Watson Lake, Yukon, along the Southeast end of the Tintina Gold Belt (the \" Hyland Project\"). The Hyland Project represents a sediment hosted, structurally controlled, intrusion related gold deposit, within a large land package (over 125 sq km), accessible by a network of existing gravel access roads.

Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 7:21 PM 3 min read In This Article: RJKAF 0.00% Kirkland Lake, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - January 17, 2025) - RJK Explorations Ltd. (TSXV: RJX.A)\u00a0(\"RJK\" or \"the Company\") has completed two exploration diamond drill holes to test distinct undrilled anomalies on the Huff patents in Bucke Township, which RJK optioned in October 2024. These anomalies were identified as potential kimberlites; however, neither target was found to be a kimberlite. A description of the drill holes provided by our Project Geologist is included below. RJK has also identified three privately held patented claim groups with potential kimberlite targets, and negotiations to acquire these properties are ongoing. In addition, RJK has decided to expand its exploration program to include precious metals and polymetallic metals. Further information on this initiative will be provided once negotiations with the existing property owners are finalized. Below is an overview of the Huff drill program, as described by RJK's Project Manager, Peter Hubacheck: Over the past two years, RJK has reviewed the glacial history of the Temiskaming area and outlined two targets of interest for potential kimberlite or metallic mineralization. Based on this in-house compilation, the data was submitted to a third-party expert for confirmation. In October 2023, RJK conducted a drone magnetic survey over two discrete magnetic targets located up-ice of a kimberlite indicator mineral train in the southwest corner of Bucke Township. Magnetic inversion modeling was employed to supplement the vertical gradient magnetic low and high targets flanking the Cross Lake Fault. In the third quarter of 2024, RJK executed an option agreement to acquire the Huff Property covering these targets. In the fourth quarter of 2024, RJK drilled two holes testing these features as detailed in Table 1. Drill hole HUFF-24-01 was oriented toward a concentric (180m x 200m) magnetic low target and drilled to an inclined depth of 150m. This hole intersected a thick assemblage of interbedded mudstone and greywacke beds of the Temiskaming Group. Selective sampling of calcite crackle-brecciated zones with minor disseminated pyrite was assayed for gold and silver, but no significant results were obtained. Drill hole HUFF-24-02 was oriented toward a linear magnetic high feature (400m W x 800m L) flanking the Cross Lake Fault. The angled hole was drilled to a depth of 155m. From 8.1m to 30m, the core consisted of mudstone and greywacke. From 30m to 136m, the hole intersected a sequence of jasperoid banded iron formation interbedded with mudstone and disseminated pyrite. Within this interval, 14 banded iron formation layers with millimetric red jasper cherty laminations were sampled. These Fe-rich beds averaged 28.5% Fe over true thicknesses ranging from 0.75m to 1m. They also returned anomalous manganese results, averaging 738 ppm. Story Continues Preliminary results from drill hole HUFF-24-02 indicate the presence of critical metals iron and manganese on the Huff Property.
