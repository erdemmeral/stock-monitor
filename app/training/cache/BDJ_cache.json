[{"text": "Certain BlackRock Closed-End Funds Announce Tender Offer in Conjunction with Results of the Quarterly Measurement Period of their Discount Management Programs Business Wire Fri, Jan 3, 2025, 12:30 AM 8 min read In This Article: BCX BGY BME BDJ BGR NEW YORK, January 02, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--The BlackRock closed-end funds (the \"Funds\") listed below announced today the results of the Quarterly Measurement Period (as defined below) under their previously announced discount management programs (the \"Programs\"). Funds with a Trigger Event (as defined below) at the end of the Quarterly Measurement Period also announced the dates of tender offers. The Programs are part of the Funds\u2019 ongoing efforts to manage discounts and enhance long-term shareholder value and provide liquidity to the market for their common shareholders. There can be no assurances as to the effect that a Program will have on the market for a Fund\u2019s shares or the discount at which a Fund\u2019s shares may trade relative to its NAV. As previously announced, under the Programs, each Fund intends to offer to repurchase a portion of its outstanding common shares based on 3-month measurement periods (each a \"Measurement Period\") if the Fund's common shares trade at an average daily discount to net asset value (\"NAV\") of greater than 7.50% during a Measurement Period (a \"Trigger Event\"). The Funds\u2019 Measurement Period commenced on October 1, 2024 and ended on December 31, 2024 (the \"Quarterly Measurement Period\"). The average daily discount to NAV for each of the Funds during the Quarterly Measurement Period is summarized below. Quarterly Measurement Period Discount Results for the Funds in the Program Fund Name Ticker Average Daily Discount for the Measurement Period ended December 31, 2024 BlackRock Capital Allocation Term Trust BCAT -5.19% BlackRock ESG Capital Allocation Term Trust ECAT -4.71% BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust BIGZ -10.52% BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust BMEZ -10.91% BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust BSTZ -9.58% BlackRock Enhanced Global Dividend Trust BOE -10.36% BlackRock Energy and Resources Trust BGR -8.74% BlackRock Enhanced International Dividend Trust BGY -10.08% BlackRock Enhanced Large Cap Core Fund, Inc.

MVF -8.28% BlackRock Utilities, Infrastructure, & Power Opportunities Trust BUI -1.35% The Funds\u2019 Boards of Directors/Trustees (the \"Boards\") determined that if a Trigger Event occurred during the Quarterly Measurement Period with respect to a Fund, the Fund would offer to repurchase a portion of its outstanding common shares by conducting a tender offer for 2.5% of its outstanding common shares at a price equal to 98% of the Fund\u2019s NAV per share as determined as of the close of the regular trading session of the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") on the next day the NAV is calculated after the expiration date of the tender offer or, if the offer is extended, on the next day the NAV is calculated after the day to which the offer is extended. As a result of the occurrence of a Trigger Event during the Quarterly Measurement Period with respect to each of the following Funds, the Board of each such Fund has authorized the Fund\u2019s tender offer with the anticipated commencement and expiration dates outlined below. Story Continues Event MVF, BME BGR, BIGZ, BMEZ, CII BGY, BSTZ, BOE, BCX Tender Offer Commencement Date Tuesday, January 21, 2025 Wednesday, January 22, 2025 Thursday, January 23, 2025 Tender Offer Expiration Date and Time Thursday, February 20, 2025 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, unless otherwise extended Friday, February 21, 2025 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, unless otherwise extended Monday, February 24, 2025 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, unless otherwise extended If more than 2.5% of a Fund's outstanding common shares are tendered, the Fund will purchase its shares from tendering shareholders on a pro rata basis at a price equal to 98% of the Fund's NAV per share as determined as of the close of the regular trading session of the NYSE on the next day the NAV is calculated after the expiration date of the tender offer (or, if the offer is extended, on the next day the NAV is calculated after the day to which the offer is extended). Accordingly, there is no assurance that a Fund will purchase all of a shareholder\u2019s common shares tendered in the tender offer. Payments for shares tendered and accepted are expected to be made within approximately five business days after the expiration date. The terms and conditions of each Fund\u2019s tender offer will be set forth in an Offer to Purchase, a related Letter of Transmittal, and related documents, which will be distributed to the respective Fund's common shareholders. As soon as its tender offer commences, each Fund will file a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), which will include an Offer to Purchase and related Letter of Transmittal.

A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the shareholder\u2019s investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with \u2018yield\u2019 or \u2018income\u2019. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund\u2019s net asset value per share. The amounts and sources of distributions reported are only estimates and are being provided to you pursuant to regulatory requirements and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon each Fund\u2019s investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.

The amount distributed per share under a Plan is subject to change at the discretion each Fund\u2019s Board. Each Plan will be subject to ongoing review by the Board to determine whether the Plan should be continued, modified or terminated. The Board may amend the terms of a Plan or suspend or terminate a Plan at any time without prior notice to the Fund\u2019s shareholders if it deems such actions to be in the best interest of the Fund or its shareholders. The amendment or termination of a Plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares.

Corporation Tue, Nov 12, 2024, 2:20 PM 6 min read In This Article: TRX TRX Gold Corporation New Stamford Bridge shear zone extended another 50 meters TORONTO, Nov. 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TRX Gold Corporation (TSX: TRX) (NYSE American: TRX) (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cTRX Gold\u201d) is excited to announce, once again, another best drill results ever, on a gram x tonne x meters (\u201cgtm\u201d) basis with hole BMDD315 intersecting 37 metres (\u201cm\u201d) @ 6.86 g/t Au (253.82 gtm) from 130 m. This drill hole result is approximately 250 m east of the Buckreef Main Zone \u2014host to Buckreef Gold\u2019s 2M+ ounce Au Mineral Resource 1 and where current operations are ongoing in the Main Pit\u2014and is located at the project\u2019s newly discovered Stamford Bridge Shear Zone (see Figure 1). This drill hole result comes following the Company\u2019s previous drill results, dated October 24 , whereby the Company announced the discovery of a promising new gold mineralization shear zone, named the Stamford Bridge Zone, at which results are revealing geological characteristics and mineral alterations similar to that at Buckreef\u2019s Main Zone . On the heels of this exciting new discovery, the Stamford Bridge shear zone has quickly become the Company\u2019s exploration priority . An exploration program is underway to uncover the area\u2019s true gold mineralisation potential. Over the next few weeks, the Buckreef Gold team will be preparing for the kick-off of a geophysical survey campaign, which will focus on the Stamford Bridge trend line, as well as an area covering up to 500 meters to both the North and South sides of the trend line. Following the results of this campaign, a strategic drill campaign will resume on newly defined, high-priority targets. Significance of this latest drill intercept: Hole BMDD315 intersected 37 m @ 6.86 g/t Au from 130 m; including 23 m @ 9.31 g/t Au from 139 m. This is the best drill hole result ever in the history of Buckreef Gold\u2019s database, and is 50 meters further along the bridge than the last hole (see Figure 2); This intercept continues to confirm a \u201cbridge\u201d or an interpreted mineralized shear zone trending 070 degrees (ENE) that is showing potential to extend to over 1 kilometer. To date, intersections reported over the last few weeks cover approximately 150 meters of strike length (See Figure 1); The Stamford Bridge Zone is a potentially significant shear zone and geologically similar to the Buckreef Main Zone. It bridges the gap between the Buckreef Main Zone and the Eastern Porphyry deposit and Anfield Zone , to the Southeast (see Figure 1). Isaac Bisansaba, Manager of Technical Services at Buckreef Gold, explains, \u201cWe are eager to begin the detailed ground geophysics work, as results should enable us to plan very strategic drill targets, and ultimately help us to define the direction and length of this new shear structure.\u201d Story Continues Stephen Mullowney, TRX Gold CEO continues, \u201cThis is a very exciting blue-sky potential-type of drill result! We\u2019ve confirmed this new shear structure to another 50 meters along strike. Although this is early in the drill campaign, results to date are very encouraging. The Buckreef Gold Project still has very good discovery potential built-in to its underexplored 16km 2 land package and we intend to unlock that value and ultimately grow the Mineral Resource of the project beyond its current 2 million ounces,\u201d commented Stephen Mullowney, TRX Gold Chief Executive Officer.

Sample Protocol QA/QC The sample chain of custody is managed by the Buckreef geology team on site. Reported results are from diamond drilled core samples. Intervals of core to be analyzed are split into half using a mechanized core cutter, with one half sent to the Laboratory for geochemical analysis and the remaining half kept in storage for future reference and uses. Diamond drilled core has been a HQ size and recoveries are consistently 100% across all drill holes intercept reported. Sampling and analytical procedures are subject to a comprehensive quality assurance and quality control program. The QAQC program involves insertion of duplicate samples, blanks and certified reference materials in the sample stream. Gold analyses are performed by standard fire assaying protocols using a 50-gram charge with atomic absorption (AAS) finish and a gravimetric finish performed for assays greater than 10 grams per tonne. Sample Preparation and analysis are performed by independent SGS Laboratory in Mwanza, Tanzania. SGS Laboratory is ISO17025 accredited and employs a Laboratory Information Management System for sample tracking, quality control and reporting. The results summarized in this release are from Stamford Bridge target. The intercepts confirm an interpreted mineralized shear zone trending 070 degrees (ENE) that is over a km long. The intersections reported here has covered only the first 100m strike length, they are down-hole lengths and may not represent true width, however the true width is estimated to be between 50% - 60% of the length.
