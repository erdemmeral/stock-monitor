editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Tue, Dec 24, 2024, 2:01 PM 2 min read In This Article: HLLY +1.21% HLLY-WS When researching a stock for investment, what can tell us that the company is in decline? More often than not, we'll see a declining return on capital employed (ROCE) and a declining amount of capital employed. This combination can tell you that not only is the company investing less, it's earning less on what it does invest. And from a first read, things don't look too good at Holley ( NYSE:HLLY ), so let's see why. Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Holley: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.066 = US$72m \u00f7 (US$1.2b - US$102m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024) . Thus, Holley has an ROCE of 6.6%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Auto Components industry average of 11%. View our latest analysis for Holley NYSE:HLLY Return on Capital Employed December 24th 2024 In the above chart we have measured Holley's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Holley . So How Is Holley's ROCE Trending? In terms of Holley's historical ROCE movements, the trend doesn't inspire confidence. Unfortunately the returns on capital have diminished from the 9.7% that they were earning four years ago. And on the capital employed front, the business is utilizing roughly the same amount of capital as it was back then. Since returns are falling and the business has the same amount of assets employed, this can suggest it's a mature business that hasn't had much growth in the last four years. So because these trends aren't typically conducive to creating a multi-bagger, we wouldn't hold our breath on Holley becoming one if things continue as they have. The Bottom Line On Holley's ROCE All in all, the lower returns from the same amount of capital employed aren't exactly signs of a compounding machine. Unsurprisingly then, the stock has dived 78% over the last three years, so investors are recognizing these changes and don't like the company's prospects. With underlying trends that aren't great in these areas, we'd consider looking elsewhere. If you want to know some of the risks facing Holley we've found 2 warning signs (1 can't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.

(HLLY) Reports Q3 Loss, Misses Revenue Estimates Zacks Equity Research Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 4:50 PM 3 min read Holley Inc. (HLLY) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.01 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.02. This compares to earnings of $0.03 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -150%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $0.10 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.10, delivering no surprise. Over the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates. Holley , which belongs to the Zacks Automotive - Original Equipment industry, posted revenues of $134.04 million for the quarter ended September 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.17%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $156.53 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Holley shares have lost about 43.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 25.2%. What's Next for Holley? While Holley has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Holley: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

Story Continues Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

Engagement Business Wire Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 3:30 PM 14 min read In This Article: HLLY +1.21% HLLY-WS Delivered third quarter financial results within guidance Moody\u2019s Ratings Upgrades Holley\u2019s CFR to B2 Targeted efforts and marketing calendar event support normalizing distribution partner inventory levels BOWLING GREEN, Ky., November 08, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Holley Performance Brands (NYSE: HLLY), a leader in automotive aftermarket performance solutions, today announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 29, 2024. Third Quarter Highlights vs. Prior Year Period Net Sales decreased (14.4%) to $134.0 million compared to $156.5 million last year Net Loss was $(6.3) million, or $(0.05) per diluted share, compared to a Net Income of $0.8 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, last year Net Cash Used in Operating Activities was $(1.7) million compared to Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities of $22.5 million last year Adjusted Net Loss 1 was $(0.5) million compared to Adjusted Net Income of $3.5 million last year Adjusted EBITDA 1 was $22.1 million compared to $29.7 million last year Free Cash Flow 1 was $(2.1) million compared to $21.7 million last year 1 See \"Use and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below. \"We continued our progress in our organizational transformation through the third quarter and are encouraged by the immediate impact that our new team members have made in their short time here. Our organization now operates with unprecedented capabilities and professionalism, as demonstrated by the significant advancements we've made across our business operations, even in a challenging macroeconomic environment. Of note, digital modernization and customer service optimization, B2B sales capabilities, new and targeted product launches and revamped pricing strategy have all been upgraded within the last year and well positioned to drive our organic growth engine,\" said Matthew Stevenson, President and CEO of Holley. Stevenson commented, \"We are pleased to report that our well-executed marketing calendar helped drive a 16% year-over-year increase in our direct-to-consumer channel and a 10% median lift in B2B out-the-door sales during the event windows. Our marketing events helped our B2B customers align their inventory positions with overall market demand. Also, through focused effort, strategy, and execution, we are seeing significant growth in some of our power brands year to date, such as ADS, Stilo, Dinan, APR, and Simpson, some up as much as over 30%. However, overall quarterly sales were impacted by distributor inventory normalization driven by two significant factors: alignment to overall macro demand and our greatly improved order fulfillment capability. Our lead times are significantly better than a year ago, so our major customers are reducing their required safety stock. Story Continues Our operational efforts also contributed to the quarter's success, with year-over-year improvements in Gross Margin, a 133% increase in revenue per SKU year-to-date, and a 25% rise in new product revenue year-to-date. Additionally, we concluded the event season with strong attendance at our flagship LS Fest East event in Bowling Green, which attracted record attendance of 45,000 enthusiasts.\" Key Operating Metrics and Strategic Highlights Growth in significant areas of the business, including DTC and multiple key power brands Total net inventory reduced to $179.3 million compared to $207.2 million Q3 of last year; inventory turns improved to 2.2x compared to 1.9x last year Moody\u2019s Ratings (Moody\u2019s) upgraded Holley's corporate family rating (CFR) to B2 from B3, probability of default rating to B2-PD from B3-PD and senior secured ratings to B2 from B3, noting that the outlook remains stable and the speculative grade liquidity (SGL) rating is unchanged at SGL-2 on August 8, 2024 Holley\u2019s bank-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio 1 at quarter end of 4.25x was well below covenant ceiling of 5.00x 1 See \"Use and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below. Jesse Weaver, Holley's CFO, added, \"We continued to make progress with our financial priorities in the third quarter. We were, once again, recognized by the ratings agencies for the work we have done to strengthen our balance sheet shown by the Moody\u2019s ratings upgrades in August.\" Weaver added, \"While our sales were at the low end of the guidance range, this was largely due to continued softness in the industry and our distribution partners taking advantage of the successful out-the-door sales events to clean up their inventories going into the back half of the year. Overall, we're encouraged by our out-the-door sales numbers relative to the overall market and believe that, despite being down, our efforts to partner more closely with distribution partners and investments in DTC are allowing us to maintain our share gains in this challenging environment. Given the performance in Q3 and the continued softness impacting our consumer base, we have lowered our expectations for the full year. While we\u2019re excited about continuing our expanded channel partnership going into Holley Days, we believe this revised outlook is warranted given current industry trends and the current level of uncertainty around distribution partner inventory adjustments going into 2025.\" Outlook Holley is providing the following outlook for the fourth quarter and full-year 2024: Metric Fourth Quarter 2024 Outlook Full Year 2024 Outlook Net Sales $133 \u2013 $143 million $595 - $605 million Adjusted EBITDA * $24 - $29 million $115 - $120 million Capital Expenditures $6 - $8 million Depreciation and Amortization Expense $23 - $25 million Interest Expense $50 - $55 million Bank-adjusted EBITDA Leverage Ratio * 4. 35x - 4.15x * Holley is not providing reconciliations of forward-looking fourth quarter 2024 and full year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA outlook and full year 2024 Bank-adjusted EBITDA Leverage Ratio outlook because certain information necessary to calculate the most comparable GAAP measure, net income, is unavailable due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty of predicting the occurrence and the future financial statement impact of certain items. Therefore, as a result of the uncertainty and variability of the nature and amount of future adjustments, which could be significant, Holley is unable to provide these forward-looking reconciliations without unreasonable effort. Accordingly, Holley is relying on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K to exclude these reconciliations. Holley notes that its outlook for the fourth quarter and full-year 2024 may vary due to changes in assumptions or market conditions and other factors described below under \"Forward-Looking Statements.\" Conference Call A conference call and audio webcast has been scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time today to discuss these results.

We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures enhances the usefulness of our financial information by presenting measures that management uses internally to establish forecasts, budgets, and operational goals to manage and monitor our business. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures help to depict a more realistic representation of the performance of our underlying business, enabling us to evaluate and plan more effectively for the future. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Bank-adjusted EBITDA Leverage Ratio, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS and Free Cash Flow are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and may be different from non-GAAP and other financial measures used by other companies. These measures should not be considered as measures of financial performance under GAAP, and the items excluded from or included in these metrics are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance. These metrics should not be considered as alternatives to net income, gross profit, net cash provided by operating activities, or any other performance measures, as applicable, derived in accordance with GAAP. We define EBITDA as earnings before depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, interest expense, and income tax expense. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted to exclude, to the extent applicable, restructuring costs, which includes operational restructuring and integration activities, termination related benefits, facilities relocation, and executive transition costs; changes in the fair value of the warrant liability; changes in the fair value of the earn-out liability; equity-based compensation expense; inventory charges primarily due to product rationalization initiatives that are part of a portfolio transformation aimed at eliminating unprofitable or slow-moving SKUs; gain or loss on the early extinguishment of debt; notable items that we do not believe are reflective of our underlying operating performance, including litigation settlements and certain costs incurred for advisory services related to identifying performance initiatives; and other expenses or gains, which includes gains or losses from disposal of fixed assets, franchise taxes, and gains or losses from foreign currency transactions. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales.

We define Adjusted Diluted EPS as Adjusted Net Income on a per share basis. Management uses these measures to focus on on-going operations and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present consolidated operating results. We believe that using this information, along with net income and net income per diluted share, provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations.

Reported A Surprise Loss, And Analysts Have Updated Their Forecasts editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Wed, Nov 13, 2024, 2:53 PM 3 min read In This Article: HLLY +1.21% HLLY-WS Holley Inc. ( NYSE:HLLY ) came out with its quarterly results last week, and we wanted to see how the business is performing and what industry forecasters think of the company following this report. Revenues fell 6.0% short of expectations, at US$134m. Earnings correspondingly dipped, with Holley reporting a statutory loss of US$0.05 per share, whereas the analysts had previously modelled a profit in this period. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year. See our latest analysis for Holley NYSE:HLLY Earnings and Revenue Growth November 13th 2024 Following last week's earnings report, Holley's nine analysts are forecasting 2025 revenues to be US$627.7m, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to shoot up 105% to US$0.27. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$658.9m and earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.36 in 2025. The analysts seem less optimistic after the recent results, reducing their revenue forecasts and making a large cut to earnings per share numbers. It'll come as no surprise then, to learn that the analysts have cut their price target 12% to US$5.44. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic Holley analyst has a price target of US$12.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$3.00. We would probably assign less value to the analyst forecasts in this situation, because such a wide range of estimates could imply that the future of this business is difficult to value accurately. As a result it might not be a great idea to make decisions based on the consensus price target, which is after all just an average of this wide range of estimates. One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. We would highlight that Holley's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 1.3% annualised growth rate until the end of 2025 being well below the historical 5.7% p.a. growth over the last five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 9.3% per year. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Holley is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants. Story Continues The Bottom Line The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. Unfortunately, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and our data indicates underperformance compared to the wider industry. Even so, earnings per share are more important to the intrinsic value of the business. Furthermore, the analysts also cut their price targets, suggesting that the latest news has led to greater pessimism about the intrinsic value of the business. With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Holley. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits.

Q & A Highlights Q : Could you speak to your direct and indirect exposure to China and maybe what percentage of your causes are you currently paying tariffs on from the last round? A : Matthew Stevenson, President and CEO: We've been focusing on inbound and outbound freight, including tariffs, as part of our cost to serve initiative for over a year. We've been working on resourcing and reducing tariffs, and we feel we're in good shape with no significant impacts expected going forward. Story Continues Q : Could you talk about national retailer sales up 12% and how much of that is due to increased shelf space versus expanding the number of doors and boxes you're selling to? A : Matthew Stevenson, President and CEO: We see national retailers as a significant growth area. Previously, it wasn't a focus for us, but now there's a lot of interest in offering performance parts. We've seen growth in some of our products year-over-year, and we believe there's more opportunity for product placement in key categories. Q : Is the pricing strategy you've implemented positive or negative for pricing? A : Matthew Stevenson, President and CEO: It's definitely positive. We've been working on pricing discipline for over a year, including expanding our MAP policy. This builds confidence with distribution partners, ensuring a level playing field and preventing undercutting in the market. Q : Are there any updated estimates on cost savings expected this year from actions taken, and are there opportunities for incremental cost savings in 2025? A : Jesse Weaver, CFO: We guided $5 million to $10 million in savings at the beginning of the year and expect to be close to $7 million to $8 million. Furlough and 401-K actions should result in $3 million to $3.5 million in savings, with additional savings expected in Q4. Q : How should we think about 2025 sales, and is your base case that sales would be up next year? A : Matthew Stevenson, President and CEO: We expect to see organic growth starting in Q1 of next year. While it's early to give a full-year guide, we anticipate growth based on out-the-door sales and will provide more guidance at the end of the year.
