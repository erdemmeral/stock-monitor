Power to Deliver EV Expert Certification to Automotive Industry RockED Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 6:00 PM 4 min read RockED RockED and J.D. Power collaborate to train and certify dealership employees as electric vehicle (EV) experts, setting a new standard for consumer experience and adoption NEW YORK, Jan. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RockED, the leading mobile sales enablement platform for the automotive industry, today announced an alliance with J.D. Power, a leading global data analytics company, to introduce the J.D. Power EV Expert Certification Program powered by RockED. The J.D. Power EV Expert Certification program delivers data-driven, actionable insights to improve EV sales and service through RockED\u2019s mobile microlearning platform. The program equips dealership staff with the EV expertise customers are looking for through expertly designed curriculum and bite-sized video lessons. Users who complete the rigorous curriculum and pass a skills assessment will become certified by J.D. Power as an EV Expert for the current calendar year. \u201cThere is a profound need for more informed dealership sales and service staff to meet the expectations of EV owners and shoppers,\u201d said Greg Gates, COO at RockED. \u201cThis collaboration will help ensure dealership personnel are equipped to serve the demand.\u201d Sales consultants and service advisors play a critical role in educating shoppers about EVs and providing satisfying sales and ownership experiences, but research shows their effectiveness can vary significantly. Purchase Experience: More than one fourth (27%) of shoppers reject EVs due to a lack of information. Further, buyers have noticeably lower satisfaction with the sales process, particularly with dealer personnel and vehicle knowledge and expertise, as compared with buyers of gas-powered vehicles. 1 Service and Ownership Experience: The level of dealer trust among EV owners is just 39% compared with 50% for owners of gas-powered vehicles, while overall index scores for EV owners are 49 points lower (on a 1,000-point scale) than among owners of gas-powered vehicles and satisfaction with service advisors is 48 points lower among EV owners than owners of gas-powered vehicles. 2 For decades, J.D. Power has been at the forefront of customer behavior analysis, guiding customer-facing strategies with flagship studies like the Initial Quality Study (IQS), SM Customer Service Index (CSI) Study SM and the Sales Satisfaction Index (SSI) Study. SM Now, with a strong focus on the EV sector, J.D. Power provides insights covering every aspect of EV ownership, from purchase consideration to charging behaviors to the after-sales experience. \u201cThis collaboration with RockED enables the industry to keep pace with the evolving EV market,\u201d stated Stewart Stropp, Vice President of Automotive Retail at J.D. Power. \u201cWe want to help ensure dealer personnel have the support they need, when they need it, to sell and service more electric vehicles.\u201d The J.D. Power EV Expert Certification is not a replacement for OEM or dealership group training; rather, it is a complement offering unparalleled industry findings and analysis joined with RockED\u2019s best-in-class mobile-learning capabilities. RockED\u2019s innovative micro-learning approach breaks down complex topics into easily digestible, bite-sized modules to ensure learners can quickly grasp essential concepts and apply them in real-world scenarios. Story Continues \u201cTogether, RockED and J.D. Power are providing automotive industry professionals with the opportunity to gain credibility and improve performance,\u201d Gates added. \u201cThe J.D. Power EV Certification Program is set to deliver a learning and enablement experience to transform how the automotive industry views learning and values skill-building. It\u2019s why we created RockED\u2014and it\u2019s working.\u201d About RockED RockED is the leading mobile sales enablement platform revolutionizing learning and development for the advancement of sales and service in the automotive industry.

Prosperous Institute Secure $25 Million in Funding to Expand EV Infrastructure in Washington State EVCS Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 8:00 PM 4 min read EVCS , one of the largest electric vehicle (EV) fast-charging network operators on the West Coast, and Clean & Prosperous Institute (CPI) are excited to announce the award of a $25 million grant to fund the development of 43 new EV charging locations across Washington state. The grant, awarded by the Washington State Department of Commerce under the Climate Commitment Act (CCA), will significantly expand EV charging infrastructure across Washington State. As the subcontractor, EVCS will build public DC Fast chargers at various statewide locations, including grocery stores, malls, museums, hospitals, and libraries. Seventeen of these sites will be at shopping malls, ensuring convenient and accessible charging for EV drivers. Many of the chargers will be over 150kW in power, providing drivers with faster charging options. The project will also include numerous Level 2 chargers to further enhance availability throughout the state, offering a comprehensive solution to meet the growing demand for EV charging. \"Expanding electric vehicle charging infrastructure is crucial for Washington state to meet its clean energy goals,\" said CPI Executive Director, Michael Mann. \"Through our Charging Forward Together partnership with EVCS, we will bring over 120 powerful charging stations to locations across the state.\" \"We are thrilled to partner with Clean & Prosperous Institute on this pivotal project,\" said EVCS CEO, Gustavo Occhiuzzo. \"This funding allows us to rapidly expand our network presence in Washington and support their growing demand for electric vehicles.\" The Climate Commitment Act supports Washington's goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 95% by 2050. This project is an essential component of the state's strategy to bolster EV adoption by providing reliable and convenient charging solutions, ensuring that drivers can charge their vehicles while going about their daily routines. Additionally, the project prioritizes installations in overburdened communities and tribal land, ensuring that the benefits of clean transportation reach communities that have historically been underserved. The Washington State Department of Commerce praised the collaboration, emphasizing the importance of investments in clean transportation. \"This collaboration shows Commerce's commitment to make sure no community is left behind as we transition to clean energy. Paired with our successful EV Instant Rebate program, which helped more than 6,100 residents drive away in a new EV within just 90 days of opening, this investment is making electric vehicles more affordable and accessible,\" said Jennifer Grove, Interim Assistant Director for the Washington State Department of Commerce Energy Division. Story Continues About EVCS: EVCS was founded in 2018 and has quickly become the largest privately held, electric vehicle fast charging network on the West Coast, home to 50% of the EVs in the U.S. EVCS is committed to leading the electric transportation revolution by rapidly expanding access to fast, affordable, reliable, and conveniently located public EV charging. Powered by 100% renewable energy, EVCS is disrupting the mobility industry through a turn-key approach that utilizes public and private funding sources to accelerate the installation of fast charging stations. EVCS has secured private and public funding to install, own, and operate over 1,400 chargers across over 300 public and private site hosts, including Fortune 500 companies and underrepresented communities.

This Article: EVC +0.47% If we're looking to avoid a business that is in decline, what are the trends that can warn us ahead of time? Typically, we'll see the trend of both return on capital employed (ROCE) declining and this usually coincides with a decreasing amount of capital employed. This indicates the company is producing less profit from its investments and its total assets are decreasing. So after we looked into Entravision Communications ( NYSE:EVC ), the trends above didn't look too great. Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Entravision Communications: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.025 = US$12m \u00f7 (US$557m - US$72m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024) . Therefore, Entravision Communications has an ROCE of 2.5%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Media industry average of 9.6%.

What Does the ROCE Trend For Entravision Communications Tell Us? In terms of Entravision Communications' historical ROCE trend, it isn't fantastic. To be more specific, today's ROCE was 5.7% five years ago but has since fallen to 2.5%. What's equally concerning is that the amount of capital deployed in the business has shrunk by 23% over that same period. When you see both ROCE and capital employed diminishing, it can often be a sign of a mature and shrinking business that might be in structural decline. Typically businesses that exhibit these characteristics aren't the ones that tend to multiply over the long term, because statistically speaking, they've already gone through the growth phase of their life cycle. What We Can Learn From Entravision Communications' ROCE In short, lower returns and decreasing amounts capital employed in the business doesn't fill us with confidence. But investors must be expecting an improvement of sorts because over the last five yearsthe stock has delivered a respectable 42% return.

Electric Vehicle Charging Along Highway 101 EVCS Thu, Jan 9, 2025, 10:30 PM 4 min read Energy Northwest is under contract with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and has partnered with EVCS , a leading electric vehicle (EV) fast-charging network operator, to install 40 DC Fast chargers across 12 locations along Highway 101 in western Washington and coastal Oregon. The project spans over 500 miles and aims to improve access to EV charging in rural areas. The project is supported by a $14.6 million award from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Discretionary Grant Program, administered by the FHWA. This major initiative will enhance EV charging infrastructure in rural and disadvantaged communities on the US West Coast, including on Indigenous Tribal lands. Highway 101, known for its rural but heavily traveled tourist areas, will see the installation of charging sites to accelerate EV adoption among local residents and support EV drivers visiting destinations like Olympic National Park or the coastal regions of Washington and Oregon. The project will include 40 DC Fast chargers, complemented by 12 Level 2 chargers. Energy Northwest, a Washington state joint operating agency, oversees the CFI grant and has partnered with EVCS to plan, design, construct, own, and operate the new charging stations. These stations will be publicly accessible and equipped with charging technology compatible with all EV models, ensuring a reliable and efficient charging experience. Strategically located at key points along the coastal route, these chargers will provide convenience but also offer drivers opportunities to explore the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest while recharging their vehicles. \"We're excited to partner with Energy Northwest to bring reliable and accessible EV charging to Highway 101,\" said Gustavo Occhiuzzo, CEO of EVCS. \"This collaboration marks an important step in expanding EV infrastructure in rural and underserved areas, making EV adoption more convenient and practical for all drivers.\" Energy Northwest and EVCS have begun the early stages of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process for each site. This process ensures informed decision-making by assessing the environmental impacts of the proposed project locations, with public involvement and tribal consultation playing key roles. The NEPA process is expected to take eight months, after which site preparations can begin, with construction projected for fall 2026. \"For close to a decade, Energy Northwest has been actively advancing EV charging infrastructure as part of our commitment to supporting the region's decarbonization goals,\" said Greg Cullen, vice president for Energy Services & Development at Energy Northwest. \"Just as we've played a pivotal role in developing and delivering carbon-free energy to the region, we see similar opportunities to help decarbonize the transportation sector. Partnering with EVCS on this project allows us to bring cleaner, more accessible charging solutions to communities in Washington and Oregon.\" Story Continues About EVCS: EVCS was founded in 2018 and has quickly become the largest privately held, electric vehicle fast charging network on the West Coast, home to 50% of the EVs in the U.S. EVCS is committed to leading the electric transportation revolution by rapidly expanding access to fast, affordable, reliable, and conveniently located public EV charging. Powered by 100% renewable energy, EVCS is disrupting the mobility industry through a turn-key approach that utilizes public and private funding sources to accelerate the installation of fast charging stations. EVCS has secured private and public funding to install, own, and operate over 1,400 chargers across over 300 public and private site hosts, including Fortune 500 companies and underrepresented communities.

Dive Brief: Dover Fueling Solutions,\u00a0in collaboration with SPATCO, has installed its first direct-current fast charger at a Chevron site in Loganville, Georgia, the company announced in late December. The electric vehicle charging hardware, Wayne PWR, offers up to 400 kilowatts per connector and features a point-of-sale-agnostic payment system. While the pressure for c-stores to add EV charging has eased over the past few years , U.S. drivers bought a record number of EVs in Q3 2024 and many companies are still looking to add charging infrastructure. Dive Insight: Dover Fueling Solutions, best known for its liquid fuel dispensers, has expanded its lineup of energy options by adding EV charging technology that the company says \u201caddresses critical market gaps in reliability and durability.\u201d Wayne PWR offers remote diagnostics, proactive monitoring and heartbeat checks to increase uptime and maintenance speed. The chargers are also built in Austin, Texas, where the company is based. \u201cThis direct control over production ensures that our EVC meets the highest standards of reliability,\u201d said Chad Bass, director of product management for EV charging at DFS in September, when the company announced its new charger. The charger in Loganville officially opened on Dec. 18 after an approximately four-week installation. Nabeel Memon, CEO of Nabeel Group of Companies, which opened the charger, said in an email there are no current plans to add the chargers at any of its other sites, but added, \u201cwe're continuously exploring opportunities to expand our offerings and are committed to staying adaptable as we evaluate demand and feedback from the communities we serve.\u201d Editor\u2019s note: This article was updated to note that SPATCO was also involved in deploying the EV charging site.

(Simply Wall St) Wed, Dec 18, 2024, 10:25 PM 4 min read In This Article: EVC +0.47% Key Insights Significantly high institutional ownership implies Entravision Communications' stock price is sensitive to their trading actions A total of 7 investors have a majority stake in the company with 52% ownership Insiders own 18% of Entravision Communications Every investor in Entravision Communications Corporation ( NYSE:EVC ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 54% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute. In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Entravision Communications. See our latest analysis for Entravision Communications NYSE:EVC Ownership Breakdown December 18th 2024 What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Entravision Communications? Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. We can see that Entravision Communications does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Entravision Communications, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. NYSE:EVC Earnings and Revenue Growth December 18th 2024 Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Entravision Communications. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Alexandra Seros with 12% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 12% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 11% by the third-largest shareholder. We also observed that the top 7 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent. Story Continues Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Our information suggests that there isn't any analyst coverage of the stock, so it is probably little known. Insider Ownership Of Entravision Communications The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Entravision Communications Corporation. It has a market capitalization of just US$219m, and insiders have US$39m worth of shares in their own names. We would say this shows alignment with shareholders, but it is worth noting that the company is still quite small; some insiders may have founded the business. You can click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public Ownership The general public-- including retail investors -- own 24% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies. Private Company Ownership It seems that Private Companies own 3.9%, of the Entravision Communications stock. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company. Next Steps: It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Entravision Communications better, we need to consider many other factors.

Story Continues Victor Dellovo Thanks Michael and good morning, everyone. 1/4 quarter. And full year financial results came in pretty much as expected when we last talked with you in August recurring revenue, which has been an area we have committed to growing, increased 17% of the total sales compared to less than 5% of sales just a couple of years ago overall, we finished the year with more than 30 million in cash and cash equivalents. As of September 30th 2024 technology solution business generated approximately 12.7 million in sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. We finished the quarter with plenty of momentum. For example, very little of our fiscal fourth quarter revenue came from our cruise ship customers. However, towards the end of the quarter and during the current fiscal first quarter, we've seen a pick up in the business including the signing every large order that should be executed during the next fiscal year. It was the first cruise ship order for professional services for our company. In many quarters, it piggybacks on the continued consistent momentum we built in the ocean freight liner market. Our freight line operation customer continues to add new ships and and choose to utilize our managed service offering following the retrofits which have led to increase in recurring revenue. We continue to see increased demand for our cloud clients who want to migrate the consumption of these services to our cloud group. We also have a dozen active cloud based projects to accommodate the growth. We continue to invest in people and process to provide managed service to assist in our clients with the day to day operations of these environments. The pipeline remains very encouraging. So we are optimistic about our opportunities to grow the overall TS sales, especially the recurring revenue piece during the coming fiscal year. On the HPP side of the business for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 we reported revenue of 0.4 million mostly from ar based customers. Also as we discussed in the prior conference call. We were in the process of transitioning our ac t protect sales effort being led by Greg Fisher and experienced 20 year ot industry sales veteran who joined us in July of 2024 has redirected the organization to maximize our relationships with Rockwell Automation and other distribution partners in a short amount of time. We've made significant progress in building the market for this unique product and we entered the new fiscal year with great potential from Rockwell and the other distribution partners that primarily serve the middle market ot customers which tend to have shorter sales cycles than the larger ot organizations. Our internal team will continue to address the large individual corporate ot buyers with the sales cycles extending up to 18 months while they work closely with the distributors to build a short term revenue from the middle market customers. An example was a deal we announced with the Fortune 500 electric energy producer that selected a cyber security. A ZT protect to protect its critical ot infrastructure from malicious cyber attacks. This was the first order of many to come as we will be is it will be a few 1,000 endpoints over the next three years. We will assist with the roll out as fast as the customer will allow. We believe this approach will result in a noted upturn in ac t protect sales in fiscal 2025 unfolds working with Rockwell automation and other distribution partners. Our sales team has quickly expanded the leads for ac p protect to over 100. Many of these leads were generated from the Rockwell Automation Fair back in late November of 2024. But Gary Southwell, our Vice President and General manager of high performance products presented an in depth view of the latest attack techniques and their financial impact. Gary's presentation was one of the show's hits. It was a major reason why we generate so many leads from our participation participation. We also had a booth at the American Petroleum Institute Show for Oil and Natural Gas in Houston where we begin a relationship with several large companies. We further expanded protects awareness in the market by attending the industrial control system Security Week Show in Atlanta. While we work to convert the leads generated from these activities into a protect sales. During the fiscal 2025 we will be supporting additional regional trade shows events with our distributors throughout the year. I strongly believe the interest we are generating at the trade shows is fostering by nine major industry awards from AC T Protect has received since its launch, including the winner of the application security category at the 2024 for cyber security award presented by Business Intelligence. Our ef our efforts to sign new distributors and gain new customers has also benefited from the July crowdstrike update f failure that expose the risk continues. Continuous cloud updates can have on critical ot applications including industrial automation industry control systems. There is a recognition from the industrial automation vendors and the distribution channels that the traditional it focus end point protection methodologies were not meeting their requirements. We believe companies using AC T protect protection capabilities can have prevent zero day malicious code from taking critical systems down out of the box without having seen it before and then relying on cloud updates to block such attacks. We've proven this capability in the field under real life operational circumstances. This alternative approach to protect industrial control service is being received as a welcome news by Rockwell distributor partners. The Rock Ball Show was the mechanism needed to bring new this news into the ecosystem from there. We believe we can expand into other markets. We have one agreement already completed and three others in process with top tier US based Rockwell distributors allowing our US team to work directly with the distributor sales teams to map out target accounts to approach together. In summary, when we consider a ZT protect market momentum in the emergence of the Rockwell partnership, the growth of the managed service business and the pickup in the cruise lines, we have a potential to return growth during the fiscal 2025. With that, I will now ask Gary to provide a brief overview of the fiscal fourth quarter financial performance. Gary Levine Thanks Victor for the fourth quarter ended September 30th 2024. We reported revenue of $13 million compared to revenue of 15.3 million for the fiscal fourth quarter ended September 30th 2023 revenue was relatively flat compared to 2024 fiscal 3rd and 2nd quarters service revenue represented $4.4 million of overall sales compared to the year ago. Service revenues of 4.3 million gross profit for the three months ended September 30th 2024 was 3.7 million or 28.4% of sales compared to 5.2 million or 33.8% of sales reflecting a higher percentage of product sales gross margins on our service revenue increased 160 basis points from last year's comparable figures. The company reported a net loss of 1.7 million or $0.18 loss per common share for the fourth quarter ended September 30th 2024 compared to net income of 1.4 million or $0.15 per share per diluted share for fiscal fourth quarter ended September 30th 2023. We had cash and cash equivalents of 30.6 million as compared to 25.2 million. At the end of our 2023 fiscal year. The robot sales, the robust balance sheet ensures that the company has the resources to implement the AC T protect product offering and other growth strategies. During the fourth quarter of 2024 the company repurchased 2,800 shares of stock at a total cost of 34,000. And the board of directors has approved the payment of a $0.03 per share quarterly dividend to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 27th, 2024 payable on January 15th 2025 for the fiscal quarter. Our engineering and development expenses were $793,000 compared to 705,000. The increase was for outside consulting and stock compensation. Our Sgnas was 5.5 million compared to 4.8 million in the year ago. Fiscal fourth quarter. The increase was based on increased legal audit and tax and recruiting expenses for the full year ended September 30th 2024 revenue was $15.2 million compared with revenue of 64.6 in the prior year. Gross profit for the fiscal year was 18.9 million or 34.1% of sales compared to 21.9 million and 33.9% of sales with the decline largely attributed to product mix. The report is we reported a net loss of $0.3 million or $0.04 per diluted share in the fiscal year ended September 30th 2024 compared to the net income of 5.2 million or $0.55 of income per diluted share for the fiscal year ended September 30th 2023. With that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions. Question and Answer Session Operator Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting our question and answer session.

While we call for questions. Thank you. Our first question is coming from Joseph nrgs with Segra Investments, sir. Your line is live. Joseph Nerges Good morning guys. How are you today? Victor Dellovo Good morning, Joe. Joseph Nerges Just one quick accounting point here, Gary last year I think you mentioned in our fourth quarter, we had a, a credit of 2.1 million for an employment retention credit in our in our reporting of the fourth quarter of last, last fiscal year. So that, that, that obviously that, that number, you know, and when we're comparing fourth quarter this year versus fourth quarter last year, that credit didn't fall into this year. So that, that's a considerable number. Gary Levine Absolute, yes. Joseph Nerges I'll go on to the, not your question. But, we talked about last year acquired what we call proof of concept and I realized the trade shows that, you referred to were very recent. In fact, we were in one last, last week I believe in Oman. But, but, the Rockwell was last month and then the Atlanta Show I think was the month previous whatever. So I'm assuming there's an enormous amount of leads come out of all those shows. But do we have any proof of concepts? Have we, have we started testing any of these companies or even even prior to where are we at today with testing, how many people are out there? How can I say testing, testing a ZT Protect today? Victor Dellovo Yeah, from the shows, the one for Rockwell, it was right before Thanksgiving and then you had Thanksgiving and then it's literally only been like 10 business days, that we've been able to contact those. But yeah, there's been a lot of conversation but the one that was overseas, we actually are starting AP OC believe it or not. On Sunday that happened already just in a week. So, yeah, there's, there's been a lot of activity, a lot of conversations. You know, and a lot of people, like the Po CS will start after the New year, they're kind of already on vacation mode but there's been a lot of good conversations and a lot of, you know, things that we have to follow up on the New year. Joseph Nerges Yeah, but even, even prior to that, we've, we've had proof of concepts ongoing even from earlier this year. Victor Dellovo Oh yeah. And, and those will continue. I think I maybe I misunderstood your question but like I thought you meant new just from those recent shows. But yeah, we have probably, more than a dozen of Po CS going on of, of, in various stages, the one that, that we closed with the energy company recently that was you know, over a year, Poc and we finally, got awarded and there's some other that we're waiting, the Po CS are done and now we're just waiting either for budgets or we're waiting to see if we were the last one standing on, in the, in the Po CS and a lot of them had said to us that, decisions that we made in January. I don't know if that's true or not, if it, if it moves, but we are waiting for a couple very promising things in January. So, hopefully they come through. Joseph Nerges And just, just, just to clarify you, you've, you've made it pr s on this before, but you, we have three fortune 500 companies now that are utilizing AC T A chemical company. The you know, the power company that we just referred to and the pharmaceutical company that we announced earlier this week, as well as well as the government. You know, the Western intelligence agency that, that are utilizing AC t protect. So we're not talking about small customers here that have, have looked at it and approved it. I just want to clarify that. So. Victor Dellovo Yeah, and, and, and hot off the press of this that you just keep your eye out there, there'll be something coming out early next week on another nice win. So. Joseph Nerges Just I appreciate that. And one other point on the stock buy back be like 2,800 shares. IiI, all I'm saying is I think you guys and the board ought to get maybe slightly more aggressive. I know, we have a little more volume in the shares now than we did a year ago. But so we can't, we can buy more shares under the market conditions. But I would think that you guys should be seriously considering maybe be, maybe upping the amount of shares that can be repurchased under the program and I'll leave. I'll move on to somebody else's questions. Thanks again guys. Victor Dellovo Thanks Joe. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from will lower with visionary wealth advisers. Your line is life. Will Lauber Yeah. Guys, just so people can realize and help us get a handle on how much money you guys are putting into this a GT effort for hopefully a huge payoff down the line. What would the earnings have been that division for this year? Gary Levine But, it was a, it was a loss. So, I mean. Victor Dellovo So you said if you're taking out, if you took out a ZT, if it was just TS, it would, it would be, it would be very profitable. Yes. Yeah, that, that's one thing that I have to understand the TS is doing really, really well. They're the cash cow that's paying for all this R&D for a ZT. You know, and to grow the cash position and to have a true start up and, and only have a small loss for the whole year. You know, like I said, people want earnings, they want dividend, they want cash growth, they want. But, a ZT is truly a start up with building, we have to build a whole, you know, food chain for distribution. There's a, there's a lot going on right now. But now that, and, building the sales team getting partners, there's a lot going on that side of it. And then, we had Merim sales last year. And unfortunately, because that product was, was, over 20 years old, the big distributor, or manufacturer actually, that was building the boards no longer will build the board. So all that Maricon business from last year, went away. There's some pieces and parts that we still sell, but they're minimal now. So if you really look at it, you know, where we were and where we are in to Joe's Point, our big customers that we have closed are all fortune 500 customers. You know, and that's where, that's where a lot of the testing. It took a lot of time through the Po CS. But now, we have four customers that are using it that are happy and now we're just, like I said, building out the food chain to try to get in front of more people. Building our name recognition, which is like I said, on a prior call is one of the things that, I think is just because of our size and our name, it takes a lot more effort to get that sale over the fence just because, we're competing with some other multi billion dollar companies in this space. Will Lauber So could you guys put an approximation it? I mean, could we have earned a dollar a year? Victor Dellovo More than that? Yeah. Will Lauber More than a dollar a year. . Okay. Okay. My next question was the increase in your recurring revenue as a percentage is pretty impressive when you look out say three maybe five years down the line. What, what percentage do you think that could be? And what's kind of your internal goals? Victor Dellovo You know, if we could double again the next 24 months, that would be something that would be we'd be proud of. And, that's where we're, we're very, very focused on that recurring revenue piece of it, especially in the Cloud, the Microsoft business that we're, we're bring, we're continue to grow, the engineers, the support staff and you know, the sales staff along with it and then the MSP, once, once, if we could get into the cloud play, the MSP usually comes after that. So that definitely, they're, they're adjacent to each other. If we could get one, we usually get the other. So yeah, our, our goal is to grow that as fast as possible. There's no limits on what we'll, what we want to do, but at least, at least a 10 to 15% growth minimum, year over year, if not more. Gary Levine To answer your question, it would be about $0.56 per share. Will Lauber Okay. All right, thank you. Operator Yeah, thank you. Our next question is coming from John Crotty, who is a private investor? Your line is life. John Crotty Hi, thanks for taking my call. I wanted to say congratulations on the 500 energy company. I 18 months is a long poc. I understand. I've been involved with a few and good job, especially having the patience and, and for us investors, we need to have the patience of a dead person. So we're, we're with you right along with it. Anyway. You're talking a lot about the Rockwell and I read a lot and that really seems like a great partnership with lots of leads. But I want to talk about the other partnership you have, you have the large one in Australia. Yeah, you mentioned there was a smaller one in the Middle East and then we had a larger one that was out in the U si believe in the east Coast with a lot of clients. Could you give us any feedback on that in terms of, are they running proof of concepts? Do they have a large pipeline or any, any type of any info like that? Victor Dellovo The la the partner in Australia that they're not the largest partner, but we do have some Po CS going on with them. They are good size opportunities in their, they're not in the commercial sector. So things do take time there but they are progressing. And yeah, and the partners that we're focused on right now, we with the Rockwell is because we're really focused on that ot space and because we have the approval from Rockwell as a certified partner, that's kind of where our focus has been because getting into some of the other manufacturers takes time, Rockwell took us almost two years to get approved inside as a certified partner. So we're working with some of the other big manufacturers. We're in different stages of getting approval as a certified, partner that can work inside their stack. So yeah, everything is moving just at different paces, just depending on how fast and in some of these large organizations, unfortunately, people leave, move or get fired and, sometimes you take two steps forward and then, someone leaves and you gotta re educate the new person and we've seen that happen in some of these large manufacturing companies. John Crotty Yeah, I agree. Go for the low hanging fruit because they're pushing you through. I agree. I also want to talk about what you mentioned a couple of calls ago that some of the government when that you had that they had many other divisions or departments or areas that were waiting for budgets to add it in. Is anything moving along with increasing any of the opportunities with existing customers, especially like you had mentioned with the Western Intelligence. Victor Dellovo Yeah, there's, there's another opportunity I think that has moved forward. Timing on that is, is not, I'm not exactly sure, but there is a deal that I feel like in the next 90 days we're hoping that will come in. And that's all I can say about that. John Crotty Okay. No, that's fair enough. And I know you have a lot of non disclosures you gotta be cautious with. No, that was it. That's what I wanted just to follow up everything else read through and I like the response and I like $0.56 a share on just the Ts side. So that's good. Alright, thank you so much. Keep up the good work guys. Victor Dellovo Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Douglas Johnson who is a private investor. Your line is life. Douglas Johnson Yes. How large are these ac T contracts you have with the Three Fortune 500 company? Victor Dellovo Well, I can't disclose exactly, but you know, one of them is in the millions and the other ones, as I mentioned in the script, we we're looking to get adopted inside their, their infrastructure and some of these were what was left in the current budget and then we'll roll out, I mentioned that the big energy they have thousands of systems that they told us it could take up to three years to roll them out. We're hoping to, to speed that up by us doing or assisting with the installation. But, there are thousands of endpoints and it's, how they roll out and how fast is kind of up to the customer. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jeffrey Stevens with Long Pond Capital. Your line is life. Jeffrey Stevens That's what's going on guys. Brett Davidson How you doing? Jeffrey Stevens Yeah. Good, good. I wanted to look, I look back a couple of years ago. You guys had a relationship with NVIDIA with Aria. You guys were, did you guys did a little a little announcement with them that they're, they, their hardware and they're using your software? Is it possible that they have, you, have you had conversations, conversations with them with for a ZT? Victor Dellovo Yes, we definitely have had conversations with them. That was one of the examples where some of the powers to be that we were talking with kind of moved on. So we kind of had to, start from scratch a little bit on some of the contacts there, but there's definitely, conversations they're not moving as fast as we would like. But, we do have, some relationships there and, we're, we're talking, more in their robotic area. That's kind of where we want to focus on a ZT in that area. What comes from it? I can't say but you know, that's kind of our goal and our focus with those guys. Jeffrey Stevens All right. Well, thank you so. Brett Davidson Much. Victor Dellovo Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brett Davidson who is a private investor. Your line is Live. Brett Davidson Gary Victor Happy Holiday. Victor Dellovo You same to you. I'm doing. Brett Davidson Good. Just got a couple of, I'm going to limit to one question. It's just going to be a multi part. I'm, I'll link it with and is there any legacy stuff at all going out on the E the E two D program? And can you give a little color on those UK contracts that were announced in the last quarterly earnings release? Victor Dellovo There is going to be a little EE to D next year it was supposed to be in this quarter. They moved it. So we're thinking it's going to be Q1. It could move out but that's coming as you note, towards the end it is at the end of its career, you know. But we believe we believe there'll be one more next year and in 2025 and then, there'll be some pieces and parts I'm, we're guessing over, over, we're not sure exactly. And then, and the UK, we continue just to grow that, that business bring out new clients. There's been a few that we sold the deal last quarter, but it took some time to implement and we turned on the billing in this quarter. So it'll continue to grow over time and these are usually three year contracts. Brett Davidson Got it. And, and so that's this quarter and, and, any, any headway since then. Victor Dellovo Yeah. Yeah. No, the pipeline looks pretty good on UK and we're constantly, you know, we're bringing on one or two customers, consistently every quarter of all sizes, and it's a monthly recurring. So, it's not like you get a big pop, you get, whether it's 5,000 or 20,000 or whatever the number may be, it's on a monthly basis. You know, like I said, we're focused on our recurring revenue at this stage of the game. We'll still sell the product and services as we do and I mentioned we, one of the cruise lines finally gave us a nice, you know, close to a million dollar professional service contract. That will roll out over over 2025. Yeah, you were focused on either professional services because it's high margin or, any of the recurring revenue. And we try to do like multi year deals on pretty much everything we do. Microsoft is a little different. You either get one year or monthly, but that's because it's a program that they offer. Got it. Well, thank you. Brett Davidson Very much. Victor Dellovo Yes. Have a good one. Happy holidays. Thank. Douglas Johnson You. Operator Thank you. Once again, if there would be any final questions or comments, please indicate. So now by pressing star one on your telephone keypad. Okay. As we have no further questions in queue at this time, I'd like to hand the call back over to Mr Deloro for any closing comments. Victor Dellovo Thank you. As always, I want to thank our shareholders for their continued interest and support. Good things are happening at CS P I&A ZT Protect and generating more interest and gaining more and more momentum in the market. The increased activity we are experienced is exciting and we look forward to updating you on our, on our progress in February until then our best wishes for a healthy happy holiday season. Thank you. Operator Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call and you may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.

(NYSE:EVC) Dividend Will Be $0.05 editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 3:49 PM 3 min read In This Article: EVC +0.47% The board of Entravision Communications Corporation ( NYSE:EVC ) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.05 per share on the 31st of December. This makes the dividend yield 8.4%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely. Check out our latest analysis for Entravision Communications Entravision Communications Might Find It Hard To Continue The Dividend If the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. While Entravision Communications is not profitable, it is paying out less than 75% of its free cash flow, which means that there is plenty left over for reinvestment into the business. This gives us some comfort about the level of the dividend payments. Assuming the trend of the last few years continues, EPS will grow by 10.5% over the next 12 months. While it is good to see income moving in the right direction, it still looks like the company won't achieve profitability. However, the positive cash flow ratio gives us some comfort about the sustainability of the dividend. NYSE:EVC Historic Dividend November 19th 2024 Entravision Communications Has A Solid Track Record Even over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The most recent annual payment of $0.20 is about the same as the annual payment 10 years ago. Slow and steady dividend growth might not sound that exciting, but dividends have been stable for ten years, which we think makes this a fairly attractive offer. The Company Could Face Some Challenges Growing The Dividend Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. It's encouraging to see that Entravision Communications has been growing its earnings per share at 11% a year over the past five years. It's not great that the company is not turning a profit, but the decent growth in recent years is certainly a positive sign. All is not lost, but the future of the dividend definitely rests upon the company's ability to become profitable soon. In Summary In summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Entravision Communications' payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. The company is generating plenty of cash, but we still think the dividend is a bit high for comfort. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks. Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've identified 3 warning signs for Entravision Communications (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that you should be aware of before investing.

(EVC) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Highlights: Revenue Surge Amid ... GuruFocus News Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 10:31 AM 3 min read In This Article: EVC +0.47% Release Date: November 07, 2024 For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript . Positive Points Entravision Communications Corp ( NYSE:EVC ) reported a 25% increase in revenue for the third quarter compared to the same period in 2023, driven by political advertising and growth in their advertising technology and services segment. The company's media segment revenue increased by 23% in the third quarter, primarily due to political advertising revenue. Entravision's advertising technology and services segment saw a 30% revenue growth, with improved operating margins attributed to better performance in Smadex and Adwake businesses. The company successfully expanded its news production capabilities, doubling the amount of news provided to its audience, which was profitable in its first full quarter. Entravision's strategic investments in media and political sales have positioned it as a critical player in reaching Latino audiences, with political revenue for 2024 expected to surpass previous highs. Negative Points Entravision Communications Corp ( NYSE:EVC ) reported a net loss of $12 million attributable to common stockholders in the third quarter, compared to a net income of $2.7 million in the prior year. The decline in net income was primarily due to an income tax loss incurred in the third quarter of 2024. The sale of the Entravision Global Partners business impacted the timing of quarterly tax expenses, contributing to financial volatility. Free cash flow decreased to $9.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $17 million in the same period of 2023, largely due to the absence of cash flow from the sold EGP business. Despite increased political revenue, the amount spent on key races was lower than expected, not meeting the company's most ambitious revenue expectations. Q & A Highlights Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with EVC. Q : Can you elaborate on the strategic investments Entravision has made in its media business this year? A : Michael Christenson, CEO: We have significantly expanded our news production capabilities, doubling the amount of news provided to our audience. This includes morning, midday, early evening, and late news across all markets, with additional weekend news in select cities. These investments have already proven profitable in their first full quarter. Additionally, we have strengthened our sales organization to engage with political decision-makers, aiming to increase political revenue and civic engagement among our Latino audience. Story Continues Q : How did Entravision's political revenue for 2024 compare to previous years? A : Michael Christenson, CEO: Our political revenue for 2024 surpassed our previous high in 2022, although it did not meet our most ambitious expectations. The allocation to Spanish language media in key races was higher than the percentage of Latino registered voters, which is a positive outcome. Q : What changes have been made to Entravision's financial reporting structure? A : Mark Boelke, CFO: We have realigned our financial reporting into two operating segments: Media, which includes television, radio, and digital media, and Advertising Technology and Services, which includes Smadex and Adwake. This restructuring aligns with our management and operational structure. Q : Can you provide details on the financial performance of Entravision's media segment in Q3 2024? A : Mark Boelke, CFO: The media segment's revenue was $59.8 million, up 23% from Q3 2023, driven by political advertising revenue. Operating profit was $11.7 million, with an operating margin of 20%. Looking ahead, media segment revenue is pacing at a 28% increase for Q4 2024 compared to Q4 2023. Q : How did the Advertising Technology and Services segment perform in Q3 2024? A : Mark Boelke, CFO: Revenue for this segment was $37.4 million, a 30% increase from Q3 2023, driven by growth in both Smadex and Adwake.
