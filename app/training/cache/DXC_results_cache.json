This Article: III +7.52% ISG Provider Lens\u2122 report says AI-powered tools can tackle insurance industry challenges LONDON, January 27, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--An unpredictable global environment and advancing AI and intelligent technologies are driving fundamental shifts in the risk landscape and insurers\u2019 relationships with clients and regulators in Europe, says a new research report from Information Services Group ( ISG ) (Nasdaq: III ), a leading global technology research and advisory firm. The 2024 ISG Provider Lens\u2122 Insurance Services report for Europe says new AI-powered tools can tackle existing and emerging challenges across the insurance value chain. Enterprises are increasingly adopting solutions to streamline their operations, enhance service delivery and ensure compliance with new regulations. \"The residual effects of COVID-19 and the ongoing global climate crisis are contributing to a rapidly evolving risk landscape and disrupting well-established actuarial models,\" said Thorsten St\u00fcwe, EMEA director, ISG Insurance. \"The economic impacts of these forces are also affecting how much consumers and businesses can spend on insurance products. Insurance providers are now beginning to assess the strategy shifts these forces will effect.\" The report says AI has evolved from a speculative concept into a transformative force in insurance, with applications such as data-driven agent profiling, predictive health analytics and advanced fraud detection techniques. Service providers are offering more specialized solutions to meet the evolving demand for personalization and integrating advanced technologies such as AI/ML to improve claims processing, policy administration and customer service. For the European market, service providers are focusing on more data-driven decision-making and predictive analytics services and helping insurance firms transform their business process outsourcing into digitized operations to improve customer experience throughout the insurance service lifecycle. While managed services and application data management remain significant components of insurance enterprise IT budgets, the ISG research says IT outsourcing providers are expanding their portfolios into system integration, IT advisory services and business consulting and leveraging cutting-edge digital technologies, including conversational AI, to improve customer engagement. \"Customer experience and innovation have emerged as key competitive differentiators in the insurance industry,\" said Jan Erik Aase, partner and global leader, ISG Provider Lens Research. \"Strategic provider partners can create immense value by delivering next-generation technologies, innovative business processes and insurance domain capabilities that enable cost-effective and sustainable growth.\" Story Continues The report also explores the need for insurance leaders to comprehensively evaluate their current organizational posture. To effectively leverage AI\u2019s vast potential, insurers should establish scalable AI infrastructures, encourage collaboration between data science and actuarial teams and uphold a culture of continuous innovation.

"Investors in DXC Technology (NYSE:DXC) have unfortunately lost 39% over the last five years editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 1:29 PM 2 min read In This Article: DXC +1.34% Ideally, your overall portfolio should beat the market average. But the main game is to find enough winners to more than offset the losers So we wouldn't blame long term DXC Technology Company ( NYSE:DXC ) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 40% over a half decade. Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. View our latest analysis for DXC Technology While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time. During five years of share price growth, DXC Technology moved from a loss to profitability. Most would consider that to be a good thing, so it's counter-intuitive to see the share price declining. Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time. Arguably, the revenue drop of 9.1% a year for half a decade suggests that the company can't grow in the long term. This has probably encouraged some shareholders to sell down the stock. You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). NYSE:DXC Earnings and Revenue Growth January 21st 2025 DXC Technology is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think DXC Technology will earn in the future (free analyst consensus estimates) A Different Perspective Investors in DXC Technology had a tough year, with a total loss of 11%, against a market gain of about 26%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 7% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should \"buy when there is blood on the streets\", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for DXC Technology you should be aware of, and 1 of them is significant. But note: DXC Technology may not be the best stock to buy . So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with past earnings growth (and further growth forecast).

Zacks Equity Research Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 7:40 PM 2 min read In This Article: DXC +1.34% Investors interested in Computers - IT Services stocks are likely familiar with DXC Technology Company. (DXC) and Epam (EPAM). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look. The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits. Both DXC Technology Company. and Epam have a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors. Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels. The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors. DXC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 6.49, while EPAM has a forward P/E of 20.26. We also note that DXC has a PEG ratio of 1.34. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. EPAM currently has a PEG ratio of 2.66. Another notable valuation metric for DXC is its P/B ratio of 1.15. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, EPAM has a P/B of 3.67. These are just a few of the metrics contributing to DXC's Value grade of A and EPAM's Value grade of C. Both DXC and EPAM are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that DXC is the superior value option right now.
