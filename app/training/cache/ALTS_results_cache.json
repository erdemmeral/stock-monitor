[{"text": "Standard Chartered: 'Buy the dip' as bitcoin sinks below $100,000 Sabrina Toppa Tue, Jan 28, 2025, 12:02 AM 2 min read In This Article: SCBFF 0.00% In a new research note, Standard Chartered bank is advising investors to \u201cbuy the dip\u201d after bitcoin\u2019s price plunged below $100,000 on Monday, erasing more than 6% of the value of the crypto market in the last day. The current value of the global crypto market stands at just $3.4 trillion, though the crypto industry hoped to ride positive sentiment around Donald Trump\u2019s victory to new heights. \u201cHope is not a strategy,\u201d explained Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered\u2019s Global Head of Digital Assets Research. \u201cWhen hope dies, digital asset prices will fall 10% to 20%.\u201d The massive popularity of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI app rivaling OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, has also caused prices to crater, given the continuing coupling of tech stocks with bitcoin prices. \u201cThis relationship highlights the continued strong \u2014 and strengthening \u2014 relationship between digital assets and the tech sector,\u201d Kendrick said. However, Standard Chartered remains optimistic about bitcoin\u2019s forecast in 2025, with institutional interest possibly helping to accelerate bitcoin\u2019s potential price jump to $200,000 by the end of the year, according to research from the bank. Last week, Trump fulfilled two key pledges to the crypto industry: releasing Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht \u2014 a folk hero in the bitcoin and libertarian communities \u2014 and signing a crypto executive order that, among other notable pledges, promises to create regulatory clarity for the digital asset industry, promote stablecoins, prevent the de-banking of the crypto sector, and prohibit the creation of a central bank digital currency. Meanwhile, Standard Chartered\u2019s Kendrick also cautioned investors to look at altcoins, or cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin that are expected to explode in the coming year. \u201cJust after phase two begins, in my mind, an altcoin light season will begin,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201c[I]nstitutional flows will drive [bitcoin] and [ethereum], partly offsetting rotation into alts.\u201d View

Pursuing a Public Market Turnaround of U.S. Steel \u2013 Not Trying to Solicit Alternative Bids and Sell the Company CLEVELAND, January 27, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Ancora Holdings Group, LLC (collectively with its affiliates, \"Ancora\" or \"we\"), a diversified investment firm that oversees approximately $10 billion in assets, today issued the below open letter to the Board of Directors (the \"Board\") of United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) (\"U.S. Steel\" or the \"Company\") regarding a variety of issues, including the Company\u2019s recently blocked sale to Nippon Steel Corporation (\"Nippon\"). To receive important updates, visit www.MakeUSSteelGreatAgain.com . *** January 27, 2025 United States Steel Corporation 600 Grant Street Pittsburgh, PA 15219 Attn: The Board Dear Members of the Board, Ancora is a growing shareholder of U.S. Steel. As an investment firm with deep roots in the Midwest, we have an affinity for the industrial and logistics companies that collectively form the backbone of America\u2019s economy. We are proud to be investors in companies such as Berry Global Group, Inc., Norfolk Southern Corporation, RB Global, Inc. and now U.S. Steel. Owning these types of businesses enables us to pursue strong risk-adjusted returns while helping support American competitiveness, job creation and wage growth. Although we understand why the Board explored strategic alternatives in 2023, its ultimate decision to ignore national security and pursue a risky sale to Nippon \u2013 an overseas bidder that came in just $1 per share higher than a competing domestic bidder \u2013 has led to a dead end. There appears to be no legal basis and no precedent for U.S. Steel\u2019s costly litigation over the Presidential Executive Order blocking the transaction. Moreover, President Donald Trump is a vocal opponent of the deal and long-term proponent of strengthening America\u2019s domestic manufacturing base. He also has long-held skepticism about foreign direct investment from Japan based on his own business dealings dating back to the 1980s. We see no reason to believe that President Trump, a high-conviction businessman who was elected by middle-class and working-class voters, is going to contradict his self-described \"America First\" agenda and disregard the opposition of the United Steelworkers. Story Continues The Board\u2019s choice to double down on its extremely poor decision to pursue a sale to Nippon has also kept U.S. Steel in a corroded state. Chief Executive Officer David Burritt, who stood to rake in more than $70 million himself if the sale had been consummated, has been allowed to misallocate capital, issue unreliable and overoptimistic forecasts, and repeatedly miss financial targets. It seems the Board failed to keep Mr. Burritt\u2019s attention on efficiency, execution and risk management as steel prices remained depressed over the past year. Rather than finally acknowledge the Company\u2019s perilous trajectory and try to course correct, the Board remains steadfastly committed to an underperforming leader who apparently lacks the ability and vision to bring U.S. Steel back from a busted transaction. In light of these alarming decisions and the unjustifiable deference to Mr. Burritt, who has made clear through outlandish rhetoric that he is self-interested and unfit for leadership, Ancora has nominated nine highly qualified, independent candidates for election to the Board at U.S. Steel\u2019s 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Our slate includes individuals with corporate governance experience, finance expertise, industrials and manufacturing backgrounds, public policy acumen and other qualifications critical to turning around a standalone U.S. Steel. The slate\u2019s plan includes installing Alan Kestenbaum, a steel industry legend who delivered total shareholder returns of more than 450% at Stelco Holdings Inc., as a replacement for Mr. Burritt. We expect the investment community will agree that any steel company would be fortunate to have Mr. Kestenbaum assume such a role. Our slate and Mr. Kestenbaum look forward to ultimately releasing their full plan for enhancing U.S. Steel\u2019s corporate governance, cost structure, labor relations, margins, operations and long-term viability as a force within the American economy. With the tailwind of President Trump\u2019s agenda, including steel tariffs, our nominees are confident they will shift the Company\u2019s strategy from hoping to be saved to implementing a multi-year plan that targets meaningful share price appreciation. The Case for Wholesale Change: The Board Has Doubled Down on its Bad Decision to Pursue a Risky Sale \u2013 Even After the Sale was Blocked by Executive Order We want to take this opportunity to share a few key facts. First and foremost, no transaction blocked by Presidential Executive Order after a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has ever gone through. This means there is no legal precedent for the litigation brought by U.S. Steel and Nippon earlier this month. Although U.S. Steel seems to be holding out hope that it can convince President Trump to approve the deal, the facts indicate that this is a pipe dream. President Trump has repeatedly voiced opposition to the transaction and has long been skeptical of deals with Japanese businesses. 1 In fact, just last month he stated \"I am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company, in this case Nippon Steel of Japan [\u2026] As President, I will block this deal from happening.\" 2 Nothing he has said since former President Joseph Biden\u2019s Executive Order indicates a change of heart. In addition to the aforementioned headwinds, the blocked deal also faced opposition from Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a bipartisan contingent of high-profile lawmakers and the United Steelworkers. When they were in the Senate, Messrs. Vance and Rubio previously co-authored a letter to then-Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen to stress that \"[t]he transaction was not entered into with U.S. national security in mind.\" 3 It should be clear as day that U.S. Steel is now fighting a binding Executive Order, the Trump administration, an array of senators and representatives, and a multitude of third parties that do not buy into Mr. Burritt\u2019s self-serving arguments. The Board should also be aware of what independent and objective legal experts have to say: \"Unfortunately for Nippon Steel, their argument is not particularly strong. The president's action in this case is explicitly excluded from judicial review under U.S. law.\" - Akira Inoue, partner, Baker & McKenzie 4 \"The D.C. Circuit is unlikely to overturn the blocking order based solely on allegations of pre-determination or the appearance of a sham process. Substantial evidence of constitutional violations or procedural defects is normally required. In addition, there does not appear to be a process for taking evidence, so the sham argument cannot be developed beyond what is in the public record.\" - Ken Nunnenkamp, partner, Morgan Lewis 5 \"Nippon and U.S. Steel face a formidable uphill battle in challenging CFIUS' referral and the president's exercise of authority to block the deal on national security grounds. Congress intended to shield CFIUS' decisions, and the president's conclusions under the CFIUS regime, from virtually all judicial review, an approach that is consistent with broad judicial deference to the executive branch on national security matters.\" - Mario Mancuso, George W. Hicks Jr. and Lucille Hague, partners, Kirkland & Ellis 6 It borders on delusional to think that the Trump administration would use precious political capital at the start of its term to reverse its public position on the transaction, not to mention undermine its clearly articulated focus on revitalizing American manufacturing and insourcing. The Case for Wholesale Change: The Board Has Allowed a Conflicted, Underperforming CEO to Hinder U.S. Steel\u2019s Credibility and Undermine the Company\u2019s Future Ancora has a proven track record of correctly identifying companies that are held back by conflicted or unfit CEOs. Before we seek the removal of a CEO, we typically try to work with a board of directors to address and course correct the executive\u2019s shortcomings. In this case, however, we see no future with Mr. Burritt. In our view, Mr. Burritt exhibited disqualifying behavior on January 3 rd , when he issued a statement that called former President Biden\u2019s decision \"shameful and corrupt . \" He continued what appeared to be a tirade by calling highly respected United Steelworkers President David McCall a \" union boss,\" effectively questioning his integrity. 7 We also need to scrutinize the Board\u2019s oversight of Mr. Burritt in light of his public accusation that the prior administration made a decision that supports the Chinese Communist Party. It runs counter to the interests of shareholders, to which Mr. Burritt owes a fiduciary duty, to make seemingly unhinged and retaliatory statements about plans \"to fight President Biden\u2019s political corruption.\" 8 Regardless of political leanings, this is not how standard public company executives act. Perhaps this is why Jeh Johnson, former Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, abruptly resigned from the Board in recent weeks. Since before the sale to Nippon was announced, Mr. Burritt also appears to have diverted his focus from U.S. Steel\u2019s operations. For example, on the conference call for the Nippon sale announcement, analysts noted that Big River\u2019s EBITDA per ton was down roughly 59% and the mini-mill cost per ton was up roughly 23% following the 2021 Big River acquisition. 9 Mr. Burritt\u2019s response to this was tone deaf: \"we feel absolutely wonderful about this Big River facility. And with Big River 2, it's going to be even more remarkable.\" 10 When U.S. Steel reported fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings only six weeks later, it revealed $12 million of costs related to Big River, which had the effect of reducing the mini-mill segment\u2019s EBITDA to just $74 million. 11 Unfortunately for shareholders, the trend of excess costs at Big River has continued unabated. On September 19, 2024, the Company disclosed that the mini-mill segment\u2019s adjusted EBITDA would be lower than the previous quarter, impacted by $40 million of costs from the Big River 2 mini-mill. 12 The Company followed this with a vague cautionary note on December 19, 2024, stating Big River 2 \"ramp-related costs exert pressure on the quarter.\" 13 In addition to unrelenting Big River cost overruns, U.S. Steel has consistently missed earnings estimates over the past year and a half while lagging its peers. Notably, during Mr. Burritt\u2019s tenure, the Company\u2019s total shareholder returns have underperformed peers by a staggering 227.7%. Total Shareholder Returns* 1-year 5-year Burritt CEO Tenure U.S. Steel -7.7% -21.3% 13.5% Peer Median 24.9% 180.6% 241.2% Relative Performance -32.2% -201.9% -227.7% Source: FactSet and Bloomberg. Peers include Commercial Metals Company, Cleveland-Cliffs Inc., Reliance, Inc., Steel Dynamics, Inc. and Nucor Corporation. *Total shareholder returns as of market close August 11, 2023, the last trading day prior to the Company\u2019s disclosure of initiating a strategic alternatives process. Mr. Burritt\u2019s election by the Board to assume the CEO role was announced May 10, 2017. Key Performance Metrics** Revenue Growth Adjusted EBITDA Growth CapEx Growth Free Cash Flow Growth U.S. Steel 19.7% -25.6% 336.6%*** -225.7% Peer Median 38.3% 15.5% 79.2% 55.0% Relative Performance -18.6% -41.1% 257.4% -280.7% **Key performance metrics measured from figures reported by U.S. Steel and peers from Q2 2021 to Q3 2024. These dates reflect the start of the economic recovery from COVID and the most recently reported quarter. ***CapEx Growth is based on incurred expenses and likely does not yet reflect U.S. Steel's $600 million budget expansion for Big River 2. U.S. Steel is now in a dire state due to its excessive capital spending, high debt, soft earnings and nonexistent contingency plan. While Mr. Burritt may not care due to what seem to be his jet-setting ways, we believe the city of Pittsburgh and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have been put at economic risk by his sale aspirations and mismanagement of the Company. There are consequences associated with having out-of-touch leadership with weak involvement in local communities. Absent a miracle, Ancora believes a substantial and urgent reconstitution of the Company\u2019s leadership is necessary. An Alternative Path Forward: Our Slate and Mr. Kestenbaum Want to Make U.S. Steel Great Again in the Public Market Ancora has nominated a fit-for-purpose slate with nine highly qualified individuals, whose complementary skills make them greater than the sum of their parts. Each is a leader in his or her respective field and is able to draw on prior public company experience to help set a viable go-forward strategy. Our nominees include individuals with experience in corporate governance, executive leadership, finance, logistics, manufacturing, regulatory affairs and strategic transactions. They come to the Board free of the incumbents\u2019 past mistakes, open-minded, and committed to producing enduring value for shareholders and stakeholders. Importantly, the slate includes industry heavyweight Alan Kestenbaum, the former Chairman and CEO of Stelco, as a CEO candidate for U.S. Steel. If our slate\u2019s campaign is successful, Mr. Kestenbaum will bring to the role a uniquely close relationship with the United Steelworkers, expertise in identifying and operating undervalued assets, and an unrelenting commitment to delivering the best possible results. Most notably, Mr. Kestenbaum has a history of turning U.S. Steel\u2019s failed endeavors into home runs. Look no further than what he accomplished at Stelco, a company U.S. Steel put into bankruptcy. Mr. Kestenbaum acquired Stelco for approximately $53 million, only to later sell it for more than $2 billion. 14 In the process, he enriched his shareholders through the success of a turnaround, whereas U.S. Steel\u2019s investors received virtually nothing for the asset. Considering the significant underperformance of U.S. Steel\u2019s operations and Mr. Burritt\u2019s underwhelming results as a leader, Mr. Kestenbaum represents a massive upgrade on all fronts. If elected, our slate and its CEO candidate are committed to the following: Pursuing the $565 million breakup fee that U.S. Steel needs based on Mr. Burritt\u2019s own statements regarding the prospect of potential facility closures and layoffs. Immediately ending the current Board\u2019s spending spree on Wall Street advisors, which we estimate to be a nine-figure sum over the past 18 months. Revamping the executive leadership team to be full of operators residing near facilities and plants. Restoring relations with labor union members and leaders, community organizations and elected officials. Releasing a clear standalone strategy so investors have transparency about priorities for capital allocation, operations and production, and other commercial initiatives. Protecting Mon Valley Works and other facilities Mr. Burritt has threatened to close. It\u2019s important to highlight that Mr. Kestenbaum\u2019s track record as a CEO includes increasing employment everywhere he has been. Not soliciting acquisition proposals from Cleveland-Cliffs, Inc. or any other partner (domestic or foreign). Please note that despite the sale to Nippon being blocked this month, you \u2013 the Board \u2013 decided to keep a January deadline for director candidate nominations in an apparent effort to insulate yourselves. We complied with your deadline despite being in the process of amassing a meaningful stake that will be disclosed in due course. Make no mistake, Ancora, as well as Mr. Kestenbaum, intend to build meaningful positions as sale pipe dreams fade and the Company\u2019s share price continues resetting from what have been artificially inflated levels. In closing, our goal here is straightforward: make U.S. Steel great again for the benefit of employees, customers, shareholders and all other stakeholders who want a bright future for this American icon. Only under a new Board and management team do we believe this is possible. Regards, Fredrick D.

to \u20ac50mn in the Spanish residential sector Neinor Homes, SA Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 4:29 PM 5 min read In This Article: NNRHF 0.00% Neinor Homes, SA Neinor Homes and Ameris have signed an agreement to co-invest up to \u20ac50mn in the Spanish residential sect Both entities acquired a land plot in the province of Valencia to develop 72 newly built homes for sale With the seventh agreement signed, Neinor continues to diversify its co-investor base having reached over \u20ac1.1 billion in assets under management, versus an initial objective of \u20ac500mn Madrid, 27 january 2025 \u2013 Neinor Homes (\u201cNeinor\u201d, HOME.SM), the Spanish leading listed homebuilder, and Ameris Capital (\u201cAmeris\u201d), one of Chile's leading fund managers specializing in alternative assets such as real estate, credit, infrastructure, private equity and impact investing, managing c.$2,000mn across more than five countries, have signed an agreement to create a joint venture (JV) aimed at developing residential homes for sale, with a land investment target of up to \u20ac50mn. Neinor will act as the industrial partner and oversee the design, marketing, licensing, financing, and construction works of the project. At the end of 2024, Neinor and Ameris acquired a land plot in the municipality of Paterna (Valencia) and expect to invest more than \u20ac15mn to develop 72 newly built homes. In this investment, Neinor will hold a 27% stake, while Ameris owns the remaining 73%. The asset is fully permitted and is located in a residential area, just 15 minutes by car from the center of Valencia. It is a highly consolidated area with all essential services available, such as schools, shopping centers, sports facilities and medical facilities. Given its location, the land plot has not been affected by the DANA storm. The asset is expected to begin marketing during the first half of 2025, with delivery scheduled for the end of 2027. Neinor\u2019s new Strategic Plan sets a goal of investing \u20ac1bn in new land acquisitions by 2027 As part of its Strategic Plan (2023-27), Neinor plans to allocate \u20ac1bn to new land investments by 2027. Half of this amount, \u20ac500mn, is expected to be committed by new strategic partners, enabling Neinor to pursue its equity efficient growth strategy. Since June 2023, Neinor has signed six build-to-sell (BTS) agreements with renowned investors such as AXA IM Alts, Orion Capital, Urbanitae, Avenue Capital, Bain Capital, and now Ameris, raising nearly \u20ac1bn through these partnerships. Of this amount, approximately 75% has already been deployed in a portfolio to build almost 7,000 newly built homes in the coming years. In July 2024, Neinor signed a fourth agreement with Octopus Real Estate to invest \u20ac200mn in the independent senior living segment Story Continues Borja Garc\u00eda-Egotxeaga, CEO of Neinor Homes, commented: \"I would like to highlight two aspects of this transaction. First, it is another demonstration of the growth potential of our joint-venture platform, through which we enhance returns for our shareholders. Second, I would like to point our capacity to raise foreign capital and the scalability of Neinor Homes\u2019 business model as a way to increase housing supply in the Spanish housing market.\" Jordi Argem\u00ed, Deputy CEO and CFO of Neinor Homes, added: \"With this agreement, and over the past two years, Neinor has already reached a total investment of \u20ac750mn in land, of which Neinor has invested approximately \u20ac50mn. This compares to a total expected investment target of \u20ac1bn over five years and demonstrates our ability to accelerate our strategy of capital-efficient growth and improve returns for our shareholders.\" Pablo Armas co-founder and director of Ameris: \u201cThis Neinor Homes - Ameris JV is part of our strategic plan to invest in the Spanish market, hand in hand with the best industrial partners in each market segment where we identify good opportunities. This partnership will allow us to contribute to mitigate the significant imbalance between supply and demand in the Spanish residential market. We have a long-term vision, and this JV is part of an investment plan in which we will continue to bring capital from Chile to Spain\u201d. * For the full regulatory announcement please refer to Neinor\u2019s webpage ( https://www.neinorhomes.com/en/accionistas-inversores/regulatory-announcements ). -ENDS- About Neinor Homes Neinor Homes is the leading residential property developer in Spain, with a land bank to develop c12,000 homes, and a GAV to June 2024 of \u20ac1.5bn.

AM 1 min read While the TRUMP token brought considerable attention to the crypto market, it struggled to onboard substantial new capital. That's the takeaway from the comparative analysis of TRUMP's market cap versus the total value of the crypto market. The memecoin launched with significant impact last week, reaching a market cap of over $10 billion on its first day, but has since dropped to approximately $5.3 billion at the time of writing. Meanwhile, the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies has fluctuated around $3.5 trillion, according to data from TradingView and CoinDesk. \"While $TRUMP\u00a0is now worth billions, the total crypto market cap has barely moved. And while it's a really interesting headline to say that 400,000 users were onboarded, Phantom was the number one app for a little bit, and it feels like the whole world was paying attention to this\u00a0token, I think what we actually did was onboard a lot of attention,\" Garrison Yang, co-founder of leading international Web3 gaming studio Mirai Labs, said in an email. \"When it comes to actual liquidity and the capital that entered the\u00a0token, very little of it (on a value basis) was from new people. Unfortunately, we ended up moving the hot ball of money around. And you can see this, especially on-chain with alts on Solana, and the amount of liquidity rapidly funneled into the Solana ecosystem,\" Yang added. Research by Chainalysis last week showed that roughly 50% of TRUMP and MELANIA token holders were likely first-time Solana-based token buyers.

Stalking Mod Ethan Gach Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 6:40 PM 3 min read Image: Square Enix Final Fantasy XIV fans began freaking out earlier this month after the discovery of a mod tool that could be abused to track down players and stalk them in-game, no matter where they were in the popular MMORPG . The game\u2019s director has now responded to the controversy and promised the team is looking into solutions, although many players aren\u2019t impressed by the developers\u2019 suggestions so far. The mod in question is called \u201cPlayerscope\u201d and it was created last year and shared on Github. But it didn\u2019t hit most players\u2019 radars until earlier this month after posts about it started blowing up on the FFXIV subreddit. Making matters worse, the vulnerability making the mod possible appeared to be introduced by Square Enix itself in an earlier update, intended to improve blacklisting features to prevent exactly the kind of stalking players are now afraid of. \u201cWe have confirmed that there exist third-party tools that are being used to check FFXIV character information that is not displayed during normal game play,\u201d director Naoki Yoshida wrote on the game\u2019s Lodestone forum . \u201cThe tool is being used to display a segment of an FFXIV character\u2019s internal account ID, which is then used in an attempt to further correlate information on other characters on the same FFXIV service account.\u201d He laid out two possible avenues for fixing the problem: The Development and Operations teams are aware of the situation and the concerns being raised by the community and are discussing the following options: Fans posting in other threads on the official forum weren\u2019t impressed. \u201cThe response is a joke and I expected more regarding this issue,\u201d one wrote. \u201cWhile I agree that the creator should face legal action it is also of importance to actually fix the actual issue which allows the functionality of such stalking mechanisms. It\u2019s just insane...\u201d IGN reports that Github has already removed the Playerscope mod from its repository for violating its terms of service, but there are worries the tool has already been backed up in other places for those willing to search it out. Threats of potential legal action also leave open the possibility of someone else making and sharing a similar mod that goes under the radar while still potentially endangering players\u2019 privacy. Yoshida did try to reassure fans that no personal data like payment information and home addresses are viewable using these tools, but it\u2019s still unclear why team isn\u2019t exploring an update to FFXIV\u2019s account system as one possible solution to the larger stalking problem. \u201cWe strive to offer and maintain a safe environment for our players, which is why we ask everyone to refrain from using third-party tools,\u201d the director wrote. \u201cWe also ask that players do not share information about third-party tools such as details about their installation methods, or take any other actions to assist in their dissemination.\u201d Story Continues .
