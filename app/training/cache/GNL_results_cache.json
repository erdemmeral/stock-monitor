About the NanoKnife System The NanoKnife System utilizes Irreversible Electroporation technology to effectively destroy targeted cells without the use of thermal energy by delivering high-voltage pulses, creating permanent nanopores within the cell membrane. This stimulus induces an apoptotic-like cellular death in the targeted tissue, resulting in a complete ablation of the targeted tissue. 1 Visit nanoknife.com for full product information. United States: The NanoKnife System with six outputs is indicated for surgical ablation of soft tissue, including prostate tissue. Canada: The NanoKnife System is a medical device for cell membrane electroporation. Electroporation is a phenomenon that occurs in cell membranes as cells are exposed to an electrical field of sufficiently high intensity. The electric field acts as a physical stimulus, bringing about alterations in cell membranes that result in increased permeability. European Union: The NanoKnife System is indicated for the ablation of prostate tissue in patients with intermediate risk prostate cancer. About AngioDynamics, Inc.

(NYSE:GNL) is a favorite amongst the big guns editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Fri, Dec 20, 2024, 2:48 PM 4 min read In This Article: GNL -1.53% GNL-PA +1.12% GNL-PB +1.04% GNL-PD +0.49% GNL-PE -0.08% Key Insights Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Global Net Lease's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions The top 7 shareholders own 51% of the company Ownership research along with analyst forecasts data help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock To get a sense of who is truly in control of Global Net Lease, Inc. ( NYSE:GNL ), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 75% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future. In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Global Net Lease. See our latest analysis for Global Net Lease NYSE:GNL Ownership Breakdown December 20th 2024 What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Global Net Lease? Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. Global Net Lease already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Global Net Lease's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. NYSE:GNL Earnings and Revenue Growth December 20th 2024 Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Global Net Lease. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 14% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 14% and 13% of the stock. We did some more digging and found that 7 of the top shareholders account for roughly 51% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too. Story Continues Insider Ownership Of Global Net Lease The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Global Net Lease, Inc. in their own names. Keep in mind that it's a big company, and the insiders own US$9.3m worth of shares. The absolute value might be more important than the proportional share. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public Ownership The general public-- including retail investors -- own 25% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders. Next Steps: I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Global Net Lease you should be aware of, and 1 of them is a bit unpleasant. But ultimately it is the future , not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future .

Lease (GNL) Q3 FFO and Revenues Lag Estimates Zacks Equity Research Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 3:20 AM 3 min read In This Article: GNL -1.53% CNNE -1.37% Global Net Lease (GNL) came out with quarterly funds from operations (FFO) of $0.32 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.33 per share. This compares to FFO of $0.36 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of -3.03%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this real estate investment trust would post FFO of $0.33 per share when it actually produced FFO of $0.33, delivering no surprise. Over the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus FFO estimates. Global Net Lease , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry, posted revenues of $196.56 million for the quarter ended September 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.11%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $118.17 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Global Net Lease shares have lost about 22.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 21.2%. What's Next for Global Net Lease? While Global Net Lease has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Global Net Lease: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $0.34 on $196.55 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.31 on $804.64 million in revenues for the current fiscal year. Story Continues Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

(NYSE: GNL) (\u201cGNL\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) today announced continued progress on its strategic disposition plan. Through December 9, 2024, GNL has closed $620 million of dispositions, and, together with its pipeline of potential asset sales, dispositions currently total $1.1 billion 1 . \u201cWe are pleased with the progress of our disposition plan as we enter the final month of the year,\u201d said Michael Weil, CEO of GNL. \u201cWith $620 million in closed dispositions and a substantial amount anticipated to close by year-end, we expect to exceed the upper range of our disposition guidance while approaching the most favorable end of our cash cap rate range of 7.0%. Looking ahead, we currently have over $200 million in asset sales slated to close during the first half of 2025. We believe this achievement underscores the quality of our broader portfolio, with non-core assets achieving favorable cap rates, including a 7.8% cash cap rate on occupied office assets. Our strategic focus on maximizing asset value through dispositions has enabled us to make significant strides in reducing our outstanding debt balance. We remain committed to delivering strong results and positioning GNL for sustained growth through the end of the year and into 2025.\u201d GNL has furnished slides detailing the progress of its 2024 strategic disposition plan as an exhibit to its Current Report on Form 8-K submitted with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof.

(NYSE:GNL) Third-Quarter Results Are Out And Analysts Have Published New Forecasts editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sat, Nov 9, 2024, 5:10 PM 3 min read In This Article: GNL -1.53% GNL-PB +1.04% GNL-PD +0.49% GNL-PE -0.08% As you might know, Global Net Lease, Inc. ( NYSE:GNL ) last week released its latest third-quarter, and things did not turn out so great for shareholders. It was a pretty negative result overall, with revenues of US$197m missing analyst predictions by 2.1%. Worse, the business reported a statutory loss of US$0.33 per share, much larger than the analysts had forecast prior to the result. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year. See our latest analysis for Global Net Lease NYSE:GNL Earnings and Revenue Growth November 9th 2024 Taking into account the latest results, the seven analysts covering Global Net Lease provided consensus estimates of US$795.5m revenue in 2025, which would reflect a discernible 2.1% decline over the past 12 months. Losses are predicted to fall substantially, shrinking 38% to US$0.59. Before this latest report, the consensus had been expecting revenues of US$803.5m and US$0.46 per share in losses. While next year's revenue estimates held steady, there was also a regrettable increase in loss per share expectations, suggesting the consensus has a bit of a mixed view on the stock. As a result, there was no major change to the consensus price target of US$9.63, with the analysts implicitly confirming that the business looks to be performing in line with expectations, despite higher forecast losses. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. There are some variant perceptions on Global Net Lease, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$12.00 and the most bearish at US$7.00 per share. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation. Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. We would highlight that revenue is expected to reverse, with a forecast 1.7% annualised decline to the end of 2025. That is a notable change from historical growth of 17% over the last five years. Compare this with our data, which suggests that other companies in the same industry are, in aggregate, expected to see their revenue grow 3.8% per year. So although its revenues are forecast to shrink, this cloud does not come with a silver lining - Global Net Lease is expected to lag the wider industry. Story Continues The Bottom Line The most important thing to note is the forecast of increased losses next year, suggesting all may not be well at Global Net Lease. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry.

(NYSE: GNL) (\u201cGNL\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), an internally managed real estate investment trust that focuses on acquiring and managing a globally diversified portfolio of strategically located commercial real estate properties, announced today its financial and operating results for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2024. Third Quarter 2024 Highlights Revenue was $196.6 million compared to $203.3\u00a0million in second quarter 2024, primarily as a result of asset dispositions during the third quarter Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $76.6 million, compared to net loss of $46.6 million in second quarter 2024 Core Funds from Operations (\u201cCore FFO\u201d) was $53.9 million compared to $50.9 million in second quarter 2024 Adjusted Funds from Operations (\u201cAFFO\u201d) was $73.9 million, or $0.32 per share, compared to $76.7 million in second quarter 2024, or $0.33 per share Closed plus disposition pipeline totaled $950.2\u00a0million 2 at a cash cap rate of 7.1% on occupied assets and a weighted average remaining lease term of 5.1 years; includes $187.5 million of vacant closed plus pipeline dispositions that are expected to reduce annualized operating expenses by over $3 million per year Closed $568.7 million of dispositions through third quarter 2024; plan to use the net proceeds from $371.4 million disposition pipeline to further reduce leverage, keeping us on track with our guidance Reduced net debt by $445\u00a0million so far this year, improving Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA from 8.4x to 8.0x Addressed 100% of the outstanding debt that was set to mature in 2024; no debt maturities through third quarter 2025 Recognized $85 million in cost synergies, significantly surpassing the anticipated $75 million projected at the close of the Merger, underscoring the effectiveness of GNL\u2019s integration efforts and highlighting its strong execution capabilities Leased 1.2 million square feet across the portfolio, resulting in nearly $16 million of new straight-line rent Renewal leasing spread of 4.2% with a weighted average lease term of 5.2 years; new leases completed in the quarter had a weighted average lease term of 6.5 years Weighted average annual rent increase of 1.3% provides organic rental growth, excluding 15.3% of the portfolio with CPI-linked leases that have historically experienced significantly higher rental increase Sector-leading 61% of annualized straight-line rent comes from investment-grade or implied investment-grade tenants 3 Story Continues \u201cThe third quarter was another successful period for GNL that showcased our steady progress toward achieving key financial objectives established at the beginning of the year,\u201d stated Michael Weil, CEO of GNL. \u201cWe significantly exceeded our stated $75 million cost synergy target by reaching a total of $85 million of annual, recurring savings, and further reduced net debt by $162\u00a0million, totaling $445\u00a0million through the third quarter. Our leasing momentum remained strong, with occupancy rising from 94% to 96%, and proactively managed near-term debt maturities with no debt maturities until the third quarter of 2025. We believe we are well-positioned to reach the upper end of our disposition target of $800\u00a0million, with closed plus disposition pipeline totaling $950\u00a0million at a cash cap rate of 7.1% on occupied assets. We are particularly pleased with our recent occupied office sales, which reduced our exposure to this sector and were sold at a 7.7% cash cap rate. This highlights our ability to reduce our exposure to non-core office at attractive cap rates, underscoring our commitment to enhancing our overall portfolio. The 7.1% cash cap rate we are achieving on the announced disposition of occupied assets represents a significant premium compared to the implied value of this portfolio based on the current trading price. We are excited to build on this positive momentum and finish the year on a strong note.\u201d Full Year 2024 Guidance Update 4 GNL reaffirms its disposition guidance range of $650 million to $800 million in total proceeds in 2024. GNL reaffirms its 2024 AFFO per share guidance range of $1.30 to $1.40 and a net debt to Adjusted EBITDA range of 7.4x to 7.8x.

Footnotes/Definitions 1 While we consider AFFO a useful indicator of our performance, we do not consider AFFO as an alternative to net income (loss) or as a measure of liquidity. Furthermore, other REITs may define AFFO differently than we do. Projected AFFO per share data included in this release is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon as indicative of future dividends or as a measure of future liquidity. AFFO for the fourth quarter also contains a number of adjustments for items that the Company believes were non-recurring, one-time items including adjustments for items that were settled in cash such as merger and proxy related expenses. 2 Closed plus disposition pipeline of $950.2\u00a0million as of November 1, 2024. Includes $762.7 million of closed plus pipeline occupied dispositions at a cash cap rate of 7.1% and $187.5 million of vacant closed plus pipeline dispositions that is expected to reduce annualized operating expenses by over $3 million. The properties included in our disposition pipeline for such purposes include those for which we have entered into purchase and sale agreements (\u201cPSAs\u201d) or non-binding letters of intents (\u201cLOIs\u201d). There can be no assurance that the transactions contemplated by such PSAs or LOIs will be completed on the terms contemplated, if at all. 3 As used herein, \u201cInvestment Grade Rating\u201d includes both actual investment grade ratings of the tenant or guarantor, if available, or implied investment grade. Implied Investment Grade may include actual ratings of tenant parent, guarantor parent (regardless of whether or not the parent has guaranteed the tenant\u2019s obligation under the lease) or by using a proprietary Moody's analytical tool, which generates an implied rating by measuring a company's probability of default. The term \"parent\" for these purposes includes any entity, including any governmental entity, owning more than 50% of the voting stock in a tenant or a guarantor. Ratings information is as of September\u00a030, 2024. Comprised of 31.8% leased to tenants with an actual investment grade rating and 28.7% leased to tenants with an Implied Investment Grade rating based on annualized cash rent as of September\u00a030, 2024. 4 We do not provide guidance on net income. We only provide guidance on AFFO per share and our Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio and do not provide reconciliations of this forward-looking non-GAAP guidance to net income per share or our debt to net income due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying certain items necessary to provide such reconciliations as a result of their unknown effect, timing and potential significance. Examples of such items include impairment of assets, gains and losses from sales of assets, and depreciation and amortization from new acquisitions and other non-recurring expenses. 5 Weighted-average remaining lease term in years is based on square feet as of September\u00a030, 2024. 6 During the three months ended September\u00a030, 2024, the Company did not sell any shares of Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock through its Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock \"at-the-market\" programs. 7 Comprised of the principal amount of GNL's outstanding debt totaling $5.0 billion less cash and cash equivalents totaling $127.2 million, as of September\u00a030, 2024. 8 The interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA for the applicable quarter by cash paid for interest (calculated based on the interest expense less non-cash portion of interest expense and amortization of mortgage (discount) premium, net). Management believes that Interest Coverage Ratio is a useful supplemental measure of our ability to service our debt obligations. Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Paid for Interest are Non-GAAP metrics and are reconciled below.

The following table provides operating financial information for the Company\u2019s four reportable segments: Three Months Ended September 30, Three Months Ended June 30, (In thousands) 2024 2024 Industrial & Distribution: Revenue from tenants $ 59,654 $ 61,436 Property operating expense 5,494 4,952 Net Operating Income $ 54,160 $ 56,484 Multi-Tenant Retail: Revenue from tenants $ 62,380 $ 66,966 Property operating expense 20,170 22,562 Net Operating Income $ 42,210 $ 44,404 Single-Tenant Retail: Revenue from tenants $ 38,378 $ 38,948 Property operating expense 2,868 3,776 Net Operating Income $ 35,510 $ 35,172 Office: Revenue from tenants $ 36,152 $ 35,936 Property operating expense 4,983 4,243 Net Operating Income $ 31,169 $ 31,693 Caution on Use of Non-GAAP Measures Funds from Operations (\u201cFFO\u201d), Core Funds from Operations (\u201cCore FFO\u201d), Adjusted Funds from Operations (\u201cAFFO\u201d), Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d), Net Operating Income (\u201cNOI\u201d) and Cash Net Operating Income (\u201cCash NOI\u201d) should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP measures. Other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\u201cNAREIT\u201d) definition (as we do), or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do, or may calculate Core FFO or AFFO differently than we do. Consequently, our presentation of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures presented by other REITs. We consider FFO, Core FFO and AFFO useful indicators of our performance. Because FFO, Core FFO and AFFO calculations exclude such factors as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gain or loss from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), FFO, Core FFO and AFFO presentations facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs. As a result, we believe that the use of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provide a more complete understanding of our operating performance including relative to our peers and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities. However, FFO, Core FFO and AFFO are not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs, including the ability to make cash distributions. Investors are cautioned that FFO, Core FFO and AFFO should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance excluding these activities, as they exclude certain costs that have a negative effect on our operating performance during the periods in which these costs are incurred. Funds from Operations, Core Funds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations Funds from Operations Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, NAREIT, an industry trade group, has promulgated a measure known as FFO, which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. FFO is not equivalent to net income or loss as determined under GAAP. We calculate FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established over time by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as restated in a White Paper approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT effective in December 2018 (the \"White Paper\"). The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gain and loss from the sale of certain real estate assets, gain and loss from change in control and impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to exclude the proportionate share of the non-controlling interest to arrive at FFO, Core FFO, AFFO and NOI attributable to stockholders, as applicable. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT's definition. The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, and straight-line amortization of intangibles, which implies that the value of a real estate asset diminishes predictably over time. We believe that, because real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation and certain other items may be less informative. Historical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization, among other things, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. Core Funds from Operations In calculating Core FFO, we start with FFO, then we exclude certain non-core items such as merger, transaction and other costs, settlement costs related to our Blackwells/Related Parties litigation, as well as certain other costs that are considered to be non-core, such as debt extinguishment costs. The purchase of properties, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, is a key operational feature of our core business plan to generate operational income and cash flows in order to make dividend payments to stockholders. In evaluating investments in real estate, we differentiate the costs to acquire the investment from the subsequent operations of the investment. We also add back non-cash write-offs of deferred financing costs and prepayment penalties incurred with the early extinguishment of debt which are included in net income but are considered financing cash flows when paid in the statement of cash flows. We consider these write-offs and prepayment penalties to be capital transactions and not indicative of operations. By excluding expensed acquisition, transaction and other costs as well as non-core costs, we believe Core FFO provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management's analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties. Adjusted Funds from Operations In calculating AFFO, we start with Core FFO, then we exclude certain income or expense items from AFFO that we consider more reflective of investing activities, other non-cash income and expense items and the income and expense effects of other activities or items, including items that were paid in cash that are not a fundamental attribute of our business plan or were one time or non-recurring items. These items include, for example, early extinguishment of debt and other items excluded in Core FFO as well as unrealized gain and loss, which may not ultimately be realized, such as gain or loss on derivative instruments, gain or loss on foreign currency transactions, and gain or loss on investments. In addition, by excluding non-cash income and expense items such as amortization of above-market and below-market leases intangibles, amortization of deferred financing costs, straight-line rent and equity-based compensation from AFFO, we believe we provide useful information regarding income and expense items which have a direct impact on our ongoing operating performance. We also exclude revenue attributable to the reimbursement by third parties of financing costs that we originally incurred because these revenues are not, in our view, related to operating performance. We also include the realized gain or loss on foreign currency exchange contracts for AFFO as such items are part of our ongoing operations and affect our current operating performance. In calculating AFFO, we also exclude certain expenses which under GAAP are treated as operating expenses in determining operating net income. All paid and accrued acquisition, transaction and other costs (including prepayment penalties for debt extinguishments and merger related expenses) and certain other expenses, including expenses incurred for our 2023 proxy contest and related Blackwells/Related Parties litigation, expenses related to our European tax restructuring and transition costs related to the Merger and Internalization, negatively impact our operating performance during the period in which expenses are incurred or properties are acquired and will also have negative effects on returns to investors, but are not reflective of our on-going performance. Further, under GAAP, certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments are considered operating non-cash adjustments to net income. In addition, as discussed above, we view gain and loss from fair value adjustments as items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized and not reflective of ongoing operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance. Excluding income and expense items detailed above from our calculation of AFFO provides information consistent with management's analysis of our operating performance. Additionally, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance. By excluding such changes that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gain or loss, we believe AFFO provides useful supplemental information. By providing AFFO, we believe we are presenting useful information that can be used to, among other things, assess our performance without the impact of transactions or other items that are not related to our portfolio of properties. AFFO presented by us may not be comparable to AFFO reported by other REITs that define AFFO differently. Furthermore, we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, AFFO should be examined in conjunction with net income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP and presented in our consolidated financial statements. AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity or ability to make distributions. Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, Net Operating Income, Cash Net Operating Income and Cash Paid for Interest We believe that Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted for acquisition, transaction and other costs, other non-cash items and including our pro-rata share from unconsolidated joint ventures, is an appropriate measure of our ability to incur and service debt. We also exclude revenue attributable to the reimbursement by third parties of financing costs that we originally incurred because these revenues are not, in our view, related to operating performance. All paid and accrued acquisition, transaction and other costs (including prepayment penalties for debt extinguishments) and certain other expenses, including general and administrative expenses incurred for the 2023 proxy contest and related Blackwells/Related Parties litigation, expenses related to our European tax restructuring and transition costs related to the Merger and Internalization, negatively impact our operating performance during the period in which expenses are incurred or properties are acquired and will also have negative effects on returns to investors, but are not reflective of on-going performance. Due to the increase in general and administrative expenses as a result of the 2023 proxy contest and related litigation as a portion of our total general and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2023, we began including this adjustment to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA in order to better reflect our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of our liquidity or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating activities. Other REITs may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently and our calculation should not be compared to that of other REITs. NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, less discontinued operations, interest, other income and income from preferred equity investments and investment securities, plus corporate general and administrative expense, acquisition, transaction and other costs, depreciation and amortization, other non-cash expenses and interest expense. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition activity on an unlevered basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. NOI excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property's results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income (loss) as presented in our consolidated financial statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity. Cash NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that is intended to reflect the performance of our properties. We define Cash NOI as net operating income (which is separately defined herein) excluding amortization of above/below market lease intangibles and straight-line rent adjustments that are included in GAAP lease revenues. We believe that Cash NOI is a helpful measure that both investors and management can use to evaluate the current financial performance of our properties and it allows for comparison of our operating performance between periods and to other REITs. Cash NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as an indication of our financial performance, or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or our ability to fund all needs. The method by which we calculate and present Cash NOI may not be directly comparable to the way other REITs calculate and present Cash NOI. Cash Paid for Interest is calculated based on the interest expense less non-cash portion of interest expense and amortization of mortgage (discount) premium, net. Management believes that Cash Paid for Interest provides useful information to investors to assess our overall solvency and financial flexibility. Cash Paid for Interest should not be considered as an alternative to interest expense as determined in accordance with GAAP or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to our financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GNL. Release Date: November 07, 2024 For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript . Positive Points Global Net Lease Inc ( NYSE:GNL ) exceeded its projected cost synergies target, achieving $85 million in annual recurring savings, surpassing the initial $75 million goal. The company successfully reduced its net debt by $445 million in 2024, including $162 million in Q3, primarily through asset dispositions. GNL increased its asset disposition target to $650 million to $800 million for 2024 and is on track to reach the high end of this range, with $950 million in closed dispositions and pipeline. The company improved its occupancy rate from 93% in Q1 to 96% in Q3 2024, reflecting strong leasing activity and asset management. GNL has no debt maturities until July 2025, having addressed all 2024 maturities through refinancing and dispositions, enhancing its financial stability. Negative Points GNL reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $77 million in Q3 2024, compared to a $47 million loss in Q2 2024. The company's net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio remains relatively high at 8.0 times, despite reductions. GNL's office sector exposure, although reduced, still constitutes 18% of the total portfolio's straight-line rent, which may pose risks given market conditions. The company's weighted average interest rate stands at 4.8%, which could be a concern if interest rates rise further. Despite strategic efforts, GNL's stock is trading at a significant discount compared to its peers, with lower FFO and EBITDA multiples. Q & A Highlights Q : Can you provide additional color on the buyer of the office assets in the Netherlands and their plans for the empty office building? A : The buyer is a developer planning to reposition the asset from office use to either multi-family or mixed-use. We will continue to collect rent until the lease expires in 2026, after which the sale will be completed, and the buyer will begin their repositioning work. - Michael Weil, CEO Story Continues Q : How replicable is the strategy of selling office assets with expiring leases? A : It's a case-by-case basis. We've done similar transactions before, such as with an office asset in San Jose. We engage early with tenants and potential buyers to make strategic decisions. - Michael Weil, CEO Q : Do you have a strategic plan to increase your weighted average lease term (WALT)? A : We focus on lease-up and renewals to organically extend WALT each quarter. Our strategy includes selling assets with shorter WALT than our portfolio average, which helps maintain a secure hold pattern while reducing debt. - Michael Weil, CEO Q : Why is the full-year FFO guidance range still wide with less than two months to go? A : The wide range allows flexibility due to the success and momentum of our disposition strategy. We focus on debt reduction, and maintaining the A FFO range provides room to expedite dispositions and deleverage. - Michael Weil, CEO Q : Can you explain the increase in cost synergies from $75 million to $85 million? A : The increase is due to the roll-off of transition service expenses and extensive work in reviewing and reducing G&A expenses. This is an ongoing process to push cost efficiencies further. - Christopher Masterson, CFO Q : At what point do you stop asset sales and reassess your strategy? A : We will continue asset sales to lower net debt to EBITDA and improve portfolio quality. We aim to align the trading value of the company with the portfolio's value, and this strategy will likely continue into 2025. - Michael Weil, CEO Q : What factors could lead to achieving the high end of the A FFO guidance range? A : While we anticipate being within the guidance range, the focus is on maintaining earnings while aggressively pursuing dispositions and debt reduction. The range reflects the first year as an internalized company with many moving parts. - Michael Weil, CEO Q : Could joint venture structures be a strategic option for the company going forward? A : While not currently on the table, joint ventures can complicate operations. Our focus remains on reducing leverage and improving portfolio value through asset sales rather than pursuing joint ventures. - Michael Weil, CEO For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .

{"text": "AngioDynamics Receives FDA Clearance for The NanoKnife\u00ae System for Prostate Tissue Ablation Business Wire Mon, Dec 9, 2024, 2:00 PM 7 min read In This Article: ANGO -3.24% LATHAM, N.Y., December 09, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--AngioDynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: ANGO), a leading and transformative medical technology company focused on restoring healthy blood flow in the body\u2019s vascular system, expanding cancer treatment options and improving patient quality of life, today announced it received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance for the NanoKnife System for prostate tissue ablation. The Company received clearance for the NanoKnife System for prostate tissue ablation following the completion of the pivotal PRESERVE clinical study and submission of results to the FDA in September. The study evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the system for ablating prostate tissue in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa). Conducted in collaboration with the Society of Urologic Oncology Clinical Trials Consortium (SUO-CTC), PRESERVE enrolled 121 patients across 17 clinical sites. \"We are incredibly proud to receive FDA clearance for the NanoKnife System\u2019s use in prostate tissue,\" said Jim Clemmer, President and Chief Executive Officer of AngioDynamics. \"This milestone is the first step in recognizing our vision to become the standard, function-preserving treatment for men with prostate tumors. The NanoKnife System minimizes the life-altering complications often associated with traditional treatments by selectively targeting prostate tissue while preserving critical functions. As we expand our global footprint and increase access to our technology, we are launching comprehensive education and awareness campaigns to empower physicians with hands-on training and clinical support while engaging patients through innovative outreach initiatives.\" Mr. Clemmer added, \"These efforts are designed to accelerate the adoption of the NanoKnife System, redefine the standard of care for prostate health, and deliver treatment outcomes that patients and physicians need. AngioDynamics is committed to driving meaningful impact through this revolutionary technology, providing new hope to patients and improved quality of life.\" The PRESERVE clinical study met its primary effectiveness endpoint demonstrating the performance of the NanoKnife System for the ablation of prostate tissue in patients with intermediate-risk PCa. At 12-months post-procedure, 84.0% of men were free from in-field, clinically significant disease. In addition, the study demonstrated strong quality of life outcomes with short-term urinary continence being preserved (96.6% at baseline, 95.4% at 12-months) and the ability to maintain erections sufficient for intercourse only decreasing 9% compared to baseline (80.7% to 71.7%). 1 Story Continues The study\u2019s results validated the robust safety and clinical efficacy profile of the NanoKnife System, reinforcing findings from more than 32 clinical studies performed around the world involving over 2,600 patients. 1 Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide, with approximately 1.5 million new cases diagnosed annually. 2 Many of these patients seek alternatives to radical procedures that can lead to significant, long-term urological side effects. 3 The NanoKnife System is the first and only non-thermal, radiation-free, ablation technology designed to treat prostate tissue by using IRE technology, offering patients a minimally invasive option for prostate treatment. The NanoKnife System delivers an innovative alternative to conventional radical surgery or radiotherapy, which often results in significant dysfunction in urinary continence and erectile potency. 4 With its non-thermal approach, the system is engineered to preserve vital structures inside and outside the prostate, offering patients improved outcomes, reduced recovery times, and enhanced quality of life. 5 For important risk information, visit https://www.angiodynamics.com/about-us/risk-information/#inano About the NanoKnife System The NanoKnife System utilizes Irreversible Electroporation (IRE) technology to effectively destroy targeted cells without the use of thermal energy by delivering high-voltage pulses, creating permanent nanopores within the cell membrane. This stimulus induces an apoptotic-like cellular death in the targeted tissue, resulting in a complete ablation of the targeted tissue. 6 Visit nanoknife.com for full product information. United States: The NanoKnife System with six outputs is indicated for surgical ablation of soft tissue, including prostate tissue. Canada : The NanoKnife System is a medical device for cell membrane electroporation. Electroporation is a phenomenon that occurs in cell membranes as cells are exposed to an electrical field of sufficiently high intensity. The electric field acts as a physical stimulus, bringing about alterations in cell membranes that result in increased permeability. European Union : The NanoKnife System is indicated for the ablation of prostate tissue in patients with intermediate risk prostate cancer. About AngioDynamics, Inc.

To maintain their special tax status, REITs must distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders annually. This requirement allows REITs to avoid paying corporate income taxes.

The Complete Study is Now Available for Immediate Access | Download the Sample Pages of this Report@ https://www.precedenceresearch.com/sample/4394 Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and malignant variety of glioma. At 45.2% of primary malignant brain and central nervous system (CNS) tumors, GBM is the most prevalent primary brain tumor in adults. The most common malignant CNS tumor is GBM. GBM represents over 50% of all malignant primary CNS tumors and around 15% of all primary CNS tumors. Glioblastoma affects around 35 out of every million people each year, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.6:1. A multidisciplinary team, including radiation, medical, and surgical oncologists, is needed to develop a treatment strategy. The gold standard for treating GBM consists of adjuvant radiochemotherapy after surgical resection. Tumor and dendritic cell-based cancer vaccines comprise a significant percentage (51%) of the treatment approaches. Currently, just 7% of vaccinations are in phase 3 trials, while 51% are in phase 1 studies. For recurrent GBM, they are mostly targeted (55%).

The injection of foreign antigens and vaccination, the main cancer immunotherapy technique, activate the body's immune response specific to tumors. Growing research for developing better treatment options: The prognosis for glioblastoma multiforme sufferers is expected to get better soon. To increase survival, experts are creating and carrying out new clinical studies at large medical facilities. New Therapeutic Strategies are Needed There is an immediate need for innovative therapeutic approaches due to the dismal survival rate of GBM with existing authorized medications. Using enhanced genetic and epigenetic profiling of glioblastoma as well as the interactions between the immune system and the brain microenvironment, advances in decades of investment in the basic science of glioblastoma are quickly transferred into novel clinical trials . The clinical effectiveness of personalized neoantigen-based vaccinations needs further research, although they have garnered a lot of interest in GBM vaccine treatment. For instance, In August 2024, a first-in-human clinical trial was launched by UCLA researchers with funding from the Department of Defense to assess the safety of a customized cancer vaccination in pediatric patients with diffuse hemisphere glioma. Glioblastoma Multiforme Treatment Market Regional Outlook U.S. Glioblastoma Multiforme Treatment Market Size and Forecast 2024 to 2033 The U.S. glioblastoma multiforme treatment market size surpassed USD 733.65 million in 2024 and is estimated to hit around USD 1,442.86 million by 2033 growing at a CAGR of 7.80% from 2024 to 2033. Growing Research is Driving North America North America held the largest share of the glioblastoma multiforme treatment market in 2023. This is explained by the high frequency of the illness, significant R&D expenditures, and a strong healthcare system. Additionally, the FDA is authorizing more and more new medications for the market, in addition to the government's growing funding for illness treatment initiatives and public awareness campaigns. One of the most complicated, lethal, and resistant to treatment tumors is GBM. The number of Americans diagnosed with GBM in 2023 was over 14,490. The percentage of initial malignant brain tumors that are GBM is 50.1%. The annual number of deaths from glioblastoma in the United States was predicted to be above 10,000. $10 million for a Glioblastoma Research Program, or GBMRP, run by the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs, was made available by the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act 2024. Previously, the CDMRP provided funding for glioblastoma research through other research programs; the FY24 authorization establishes a separate program to support research for this brain cancer. High-impact research is identified and funded by the CDMRP through a community-driven approach. According to the Brain Tumour Registry of Canada*, the incidence of glioblastoma (GB), sometimes referred to as glioblastoma multiforme, is 4 per 100,000 individuals in Canada. Fifty to sixty percent of astrocytic tumors and twelve to fifteen percent of all brain tumors are caused by GB. Men are more likely than women to be affected by GBMs, and their incidence rises with age. Growing Investments Drive Asia Pacific\u2019s Market Asia Pacific is estimated to grow at the fastest rate during the forecast period. Elements include the expansion of R&D efforts in the medical field and the expansion of a sizable patient base linked to certain illnesses throughout the area. The medical system in the Asia-Pacific region has been moving more and more toward cutting-edge surgical techniques and technology advancements to treat serious illnesses, such as brain tumors. This might thus have a favorable impact on the market demand for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) surgery, which in turn could lead to profitable prospects for the glioblastoma multiforme treatment market in Asia Pacific in the near future. About 2% of all malignancies in India are brain tumors, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). About 30,000 new instances of brain tumors are thought to be diagnosed in India annually. A nonprofit organization called the Brain Tumour Foundation works to enhance the care and therapies that individuals with brain tumors and their families can get. The Foundation provides financial assistance for the care and treatment of individuals with brain tumors who are in need. Additionally, it finances medical education, nursing, and research initiatives. Members of the Foundation's BTF Support Team are experts in brain tumor care, in addition to the oncologists and other professionals who are accessible for consultation.

The usual course of treatment for a GBM is surgery, followed by oral chemotherapy and daily radiotherapy . In order to preserve the surrounding normal brain tissue necessary for optimal neurological function, the main goal of surgery is to remove as much of the tumor as feasible. In general, the direct expenses for treating glioblastoma from the time of diagnosis to death vary between $14,110 in Canada and $204,284 in the US. The radiation therapy segment is estimated to grow at the fastest rate in the glioblastoma multiforme treatment market during the forecast period. One of the most important aspects of treating glioblastoma is frequently radiation therapy. It can successfully shrink a tumor, limit its growth, and diminish its symptoms, all of which can improve a patient's quality of life even if it is not a cure. By Drug Class Outlook The TMZ segment dominated the glioblastoma multiforme treatment market in 2023. Temozolomide (TMZ) has been the predominant chemotherapy for GBM for the past 20 years. An oral alkylating drug called temozolomide has become a mainstay in the treatment of several brain cancers, most notably GBM. The negative effects of TMZ are generally mild, and patients tolerate it well. Just 15% of individuals stop using TMZ because of its unbearable side effects. Since the effectiveness of various TMZ treatment plans varies from person to person, therapy should be as individualized as possible. By End-user Outlook The hospitals segment held the largest share of the glioblastoma multiforme treatment market in 2023. Patients choose hospitals because they are convenient and offer accessible therapy. Additionally, it is expected that the market would be driven by the large number of operations done to control GBM and the complexity of the therapy. The clinics segment held the second-largest share of the market in 2023. The market is expected to grow as noninvasive treatments like radiation therapy and tumor-treating field therapy become more widely used. Growth in the business is anticipated to be aided by the growing use of patient-centered, noninvasive therapies, including tumor-treating field therapy and external beam radiation therapy.
