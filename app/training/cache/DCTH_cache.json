[{"text": "retail investors who own 58% along with institutions invested in Delcath Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:DCTH) saw increase in their holdings value last week editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sun, Jan 26, 2025, 3:46 PM 4 min read In This Article: DCTH -0.96% Key Insights Delcath Systems' significant retail investors ownership suggests that the key decisions are influenced by shareholders from the larger public The top 25 shareholders own 38% of the company Institutional ownership in Delcath Systems is 35% Every investor in Delcath Systems, Inc. ( NASDAQ:DCTH ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that retail investors own the lion's share in the company with 58% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. Retail investors gained the most after market cap touched US$512m last week, while institutions who own 35% also benefitted. In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Delcath Systems. See our latest analysis for Delcath Systems NasdaqCM:DCTH Ownership Breakdown January 26th 2025 What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Delcath Systems? Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. We can see that Delcath Systems does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Delcath Systems, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. NasdaqCM:DCTH Earnings and Revenue Growth January 26th 2025 Delcath Systems is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Rosalind Advisors, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.4% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 5.3% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.8% by the third-largest shareholder. In addition, we found that Gerard Michel, the CEO has 1.0% of the shares allocated to their name. A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. Story Continues Insider Ownership Of Delcath Systems While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. We can report that insiders do own shares in Delcath Systems, Inc.. In their own names, insiders own US$12m worth of stock in the US$512m company. It is good to see some investment by insiders, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public Ownership The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a substantial 58% stake in Delcath Systems, suggesting it is a fairly popular stock. With this amount of ownership, retail investors can collectively play a role in decisions that affect shareholder returns, such as dividend policies and the appointment of directors. They can also exercise the power to vote on acquisitions or mergers that may not improve profitability. Private Equity Ownership With an ownership of 5.3%, private equity firms are in a position to play a role in shaping corporate strategy with a focus on value creation. Sometimes we see private equity stick around for the long term, but generally speaking they have a shorter investment horizon and -- as the name suggests -- don't invest in public companies much. After some time they may look to sell and redeploy capital elsewhere. Next Steps: While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

{"text": "Delcath Systems, Inc. (DCTH): Analysts Recommend This 52-Week High Stocks Now Neha Gupta Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 10:31 PM 5 min read We recently compiled a list of the 14 Best 52-Week High Stocks To Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Delcath Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:DCTH) stands against the other stocks. After two years of substantial gains to record highs, exhaustion in the US equity markets is slowly kicking in. Pullbacks in various sectors have come into play amid growing concerns about overstretched valuations. Likewise, the pullbacks have come on bond yields surging to levels not seen in two months, triggering a selloff in growth-oriented stocks. The 10-year yield touching highs of 4.79% has once again triggered demand for bonds at the expense of stocks, given the yields on offer. Additionally, the surge in bond yields comes on stronger-than-expected jobs reports that cast doubt on further interest rate cuts. The stock market rallied to record highs last year amid expectations that the Fed will embark on an aggressive easing push that involves interest rate cuts. A spike in inflation levels amid a resilient US job market has once again averted the prospects of the Fed aggressively cutting interest rates. Consequently, the global rise in bond yields around the globe is being driven by expectations of fewer than expected interest rate cuts.

The sentiments echo serious concerns about stocks trading at 52-week highs after blockbuster moves last year. Given that valuations at 52-week highs often appear overstretched, there are growing concerns that some of the stocks could be the subject of significant pullbacks. Amid the concerns, Turnquist does not see the prospect of the market edging into bear territory even though the market appears to be in a correction phase. Analysts at Goldman Sachs are also bullish about the equity market's outlook and believe there is not enough reason to back away from investing. Additionally, the analysts don\u2019t expect 2025 to be a problematic year for equity investments. \u201cValuations are not a good timing signal. ... There\u2019s no clear relationship between your starting valuation and the returns one year later,\u201d Brett Nelson, head of tactical asset allocation for the group, said Story Continues Goldman Sachs analysts expect the US economy to grow faster than Europe in 2025. A resilient US economy amid high interest rates should fuel stellar financial results characterized by revenue and earnings growth. \u201cWe do think that the earnings advantage that the U.S. has will continue,\u201d said Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, chief investment officer for the Goldman unit. The prospect of the US economy staying clear of recession even with the Fed leaving interest rates at current levels should offer much-needed support to stocks trading at all-time highs. Analysts also expect friendly regulations and deregulation from the upcoming Republican administration to act as a tailwind to fuel further gains in the equity markets.

Here's Why Zacks Equity Research Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 4:50 PM 3 min read When it comes to short-term investing or trading, they say \"the trend is your friend.\" And there's no denying that this is the most profitable strategy. But making sure of the sustainability of a trend to profit from it is easier said than done. The trend often reverses before exiting the trade, leading to a short-term capital loss for investors. So, for a profitable trade, one should confirm factors such as sound fundamentals, positive earnings estimate revisions, etc. that could keep the momentum in the stock alive. Our \"Recent Price Strength\" screen, which is created on a unique short-term trading strategy, could be pretty useful in this regard. This predefined screen makes it really easy to shortlist the stocks that have enough fundamental strength to maintain their recent uptrend. Also, the screen passes only the stocks that are trading in the upper portion of their 52-week high-low range, which is usually an indicator of bullishness. There are several stocks that passed through the screen and Delcath Systems, Inc. (DCTH) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a solid choice for \"trend\" investing. A solid price increase over a period of 12 weeks reflects investors' continued willingness to pay more for the potential upside in a stock. DCTH is quite a good fit in this regard, gaining 15.8% over this period. However, it's not enough to look at the price change for around three months, as it doesn't reflect any trend reversal that might have happened in a shorter time frame. It's important for a potential winner to maintain the price trend. A price increase of 4.7% over the past four weeks ensures that the trend is still in place for the stock of this company. Moreover, DCTH is currently trading at 94.7% of its 52-week High-Low Range, hinting that it can be on the verge of a breakout. Looking at the fundamentals, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises -- the key factors that impact a stock's near-term price movements. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> Story Continues Another factor that confirms the company's fundamental strength is its Average Broker Recommendation of #1 (Strong Buy). This indicates that the brokerage community is highly optimistic about the stock's near-term price performance. So, the price trend in DCTH may not reverse anytime soon. In addition to DCTH, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our \"Recent Price Strength\" screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria. This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market. However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

-0.96% Fourth Quarter Revenue Approximately $15.1 Million and Full Year Total Revenue Approximately $37.2 Million QUEENSBURY, N.Y., January 13, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Delcath Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq: DCTH) (\"Delcath\" or the \"Company\"), an interventional oncology company focused on the treatment of primary and metastatic cancers of the liver, today announced preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter and year-ended December 31, 2024. Preliminary Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2024 Financial Results (unaudited) Total fourth quarter and full year revenue expected to be approximately $15.1 million and $37.2 million, respectively HEPZATO KIT\u2122 fourth quarter and full year revenue expected to be approximately $13.7 million and $32.3 million, respectively CHEMOSAT \u00ae fourth quarter and full year revenue expected to be approximately $1.4 million and $4.9 million, respectively Gross margins expected to be in the 80%-85% range As of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $53.2 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and no debt Final financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024 and a detailed business update will be provided during Delcath\u2019s annual financial results release and investor call scheduled for March 6, 2025. About Delcath Systems, Inc., HEPZATO KIT and CHEMOSAT Delcath Systems, Inc. is an interventional oncology company focused on the treatment of primary and metastatic liver cancers. The company's proprietary products, HEPZATO KIT\u2122 (HEPZATO (melphalan) for Injection/Hepatic Delivery System) and CHEMOSAT \u00ae Hepatic Delivery System for Melphalan percutaneous hepatic perfusion (PHP), are designed to administer high-dose chemotherapy to the liver while controlling systemic exposure and associated side effects during a PHP procedure. In the United States, HEPZATO KIT is considered a combination drug and device product and is regulated and approved for sale as a drug by the FDA. HEPZATO KIT is comprised of the chemotherapeutic drug melphalan and Delcath's proprietary Hepatic Delivery System (HDS). The HDS is used to isolate the hepatic venous blood from the systemic circulation while simultaneously filtrating hepatic venous blood during melphalan infusion and washout. The use of the HDS results in loco-regional delivery of a relatively high melphalan dose, which can potentially induce a clinically meaningful tumor response with minimal hepatotoxicity and reduce systemic exposure. HEPZATO KIT is approved in the United States as a liver-directed treatment for adult patients with metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM) with unresectable hepatic metastases affecting less than 50% of the liver and no extrahepatic disease, or extrahepatic disease limited to the bone, lymph nodes, subcutaneous tissues, or lung that is amenable to resection or radiation. Please see the full Prescribing Information , including BOXED WARNING for the HEPZATO KIT. Story Continues In Europe, the device-only configuration of the HDS is regulated as a Class III medical device and is approved for sale under the trade name CHEMOSAT Hepatic Delivery System for Melphalan, or CHEMOSAT, where it has been used in the conduct of percutaneous hepatic perfusion procedures at major medical centers to treat a wide range of cancers of the liver.

Wire Sat, Jan 4, 2025, 12:01 AM 3 min read In This Article: DCTH -0.96% QUEENSBURY, N.Y., January 03, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Delcath Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq: DCTH) (the \"Company\" or \"Delcath\"), an interventional oncology company focused on the treatment of primary and metastatic cancers of the liver, announces that the Company granted an equity award, previously approved by the Company\u2019s Compensation Committee, as a material inducement to the employment of an individual whose employment commenced on November 4, 2024. The grant totaled the right to purchase 30,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock and is subject to the terms and conditions of the Company\u2019s 2023 Inducement Plan (\"Plan\"). The options were granted on December 31, 2024, the date the Compensation Committee approved the stock option included within the equity inducement and are subject to an exercise price equal to $12.04, the closing price of Delcath\u2019s common stock on December 31, 2024. One-third of the options will vest on the first anniversary of the grant date with the remaining two-thirds of the options vesting in equal monthly installments over the following twenty-four months. The options have a ten-year term and the vesting of the options is subject to the employee\u2019s continued employment with Delcath on each vesting date. The above-described award was granted in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4) and granted pursuant to the terms of the Plan. About Delcath Systems, Inc. Delcath Systems, Inc. is an interventional oncology company focused on the treatment of primary and metastatic liver cancers. The company\u2019s proprietary products, HEPZATO KIT\u2122 (HEPZATO (melphalan) for Injection/Hepatic Delivery System) and CHEMOSAT \u00ae Hepatic Delivery System for Melphalan percutaneous hepatic perfusion (PHP), are designed to administer high-dose chemotherapy to the liver while controlling systemic exposure and associated side effects during a PHP procedure. In the United States, HEPZATO KIT is considered a combination drug and device product and is regulated and approved for sale as a drug by the FDA. HEPZATO KIT is comprised of the chemotherapeutic drug melphalan and Delcath's proprietary Hepatic Delivery System (HDS). The HDS is used to isolate the hepatic venous blood from the systemic circulation while simultaneously filtrating hepatic venous blood during melphalan infusion and washout. The use of the HDS results in loco-regional delivery of a relatively high melphalan dose, which can potentially induce a clinically meaningful tumor response with minimal hepatotoxicity and reduce systemic exposure. HEPZATO KIT is approved in the United States as a liver-directed treatment for adult patients with metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM) with unresectable hepatic metastases affecting less than 50% of the liver and no extrahepatic disease, or extrahepatic disease limited to the bone, lymph nodes, subcutaneous tissues, or lung that is amenable to resection or radiation. Please see the full Prescribing Information, including BOXED WARNING for the HEPZATO KIT . Story Continues In Europe, the device-only configuration of the HDS is regulated as a Class III medical device and is approved for sale under the trade name CHEMOSAT Hepatic Delivery System for Melphalan, or CHEMOSAT, where it has been used in the conduct of percutaneous hepatic perfusion procedures at major medical centers to treat a wide range of cancers of the liver.

Funding From Series E and E1 Warrant Exercises Business Wire Mon, Dec 30, 2024, 4:00 PM 3 min read In This Article: DCTH -0.96% QUEENSBURY, N.Y., December 30, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Delcath Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq: DCTH) (\"Delcath\" or the \"Company\"), an interventional oncology company focused on the treatment of primary and metastatic cancers of the liver, today announced the exercise of 1.7 million Series E and E1 warrants which resulted in $16.3 million of funding. Approximately 6.6% of the warrants exercised were subject to cashless exercise provisions. The warrants, issued in July and August 2019 as a component of a private placement, had an exercise price of $10.00 per share and expired on December 24, 2024. \"With the exercise of these warrants, current cash on hand and cash expected from operations as a result of our revenue growth, we believe that we are in a strong position to execute on our ongoing commercialization efforts and our robust clinical development plan,\" said Gerard Michel, Delcath\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Michel continued, \"As we continue to drive the commercial success of HEPZATO to treat uveal melanoma patients we can confidently invest in new clinical trials.\" About Delcath Systems, Inc., HEPZATO KIT and CHEMOSAT Delcath Systems, Inc. is an interventional oncology company focused on the treatment of primary and metastatic liver cancers. The company\u2019s proprietary products, HEPZATO KIT \u2122 (HEPZATO (melphalan) for Injection/Hepatic Delivery System) and CHEMOSAT \u00ae Hepatic Delivery System for Melphalan percutaneous hepatic perfusion (PHP), are designed to administer high-dose chemotherapy to the liver while controlling systemic exposure and associated side effects during a PHP procedure. In the United States, HEPZATO KIT is considered a combination drug and device product and is regulated and approved for sale as a drug by the FDA. HEPZATO KIT is comprised of the chemotherapeutic drug melphalan and Delcath's proprietary Hepatic Delivery System (HDS). The HDS is used to isolate the hepatic venous blood from the systemic circulation while simultaneously filtrating hepatic venous blood during melphalan infusion and washout. The use of the HDS results in loco-regional delivery of a relatively high melphalan dose, which can potentially induce a clinically meaningful tumor response with minimal hepatotoxicity and reduce systemic exposure. HEPZATO KIT is approved in the United States as a liver-directed treatment for adult patients with metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM) with unresectable hepatic metastases affecting less than 50% of the liver and no extrahepatic disease, or extrahepatic disease limited to the bone, lymph nodes, subcutaneous tissues, or lung that is amenable to resection or radiation. Please see the full Prescribing Information , including BOXED WARNING for the HEPZATO KIT. Story Continues In Europe, the device-only configuration of the HDS is regulated as a Class III medical device and is approved for sale under the trade name CHEMOSAT Hepatic Delivery System for Melphalan, or CHEMOSAT, where it has been used in the conduct of percutaneous hepatic perfusion procedures at major medical centers to treat a wide range of cancers of the liver.

The words \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"continue,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"should,\" \"target,\" \"will,\" \"would\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, uncertainties relating to: the Company\u2019s commercialization plans and its ability to successfully commercialize the HEPZATO KIT; the Company\u2019s successful management of the HEPZATO KIT supply chain, including securing adequate supply of critical components necessary to manufacture and assemble the HEPZATO KIT; successful FDA inspections of the facilities of the Company and those of its third-party suppliers/manufacturers; the Company\u2019s successful implementation and management of the HEPZATO KIT Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy; the potential benefits of the HEPZATO KIT as a treatment for patients with primary and metastatic disease in the liver; the Company\u2019s ability to obtain reimbursement for the HEPZATO KIT; and the Company\u2019s ability to successfully enter into any necessary purchase and sale agreements with users of the HEPZATO KIT. For additional information about these factors, and others that may impact the Company, please see the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K. However, new risk factors and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all risk factors and uncertainties. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they are made.

Delcath Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:DCTH) Before Long editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sun, Dec 29, 2024, 4:10 PM 3 min read In This Article: DCTH -0.96% We feel now is a pretty good time to analyse Delcath Systems, Inc.'s ( NASDAQ:DCTH ) business as it appears the company may be on the cusp of a considerable accomplishment. Delcath Systems, Inc., an interventional oncology company, focuses on the treatment of primary and metastatic liver cancers in the United States and Europe. The US$382m market-cap company\u2019s loss lessened since it announced a US$48m loss in the full financial year, compared to the latest trailing-twelve-month loss of US$34m, as it approaches breakeven. Many investors are wondering about the rate at which Delcath Systems will turn a profit, with the big question being \u201cwhen will the company breakeven?\u201d We've put together a brief outline of industry analyst expectations for the company, its year of breakeven and its implied growth rate. See our latest analysis for Delcath Systems According to the 6 industry analysts covering Delcath Systems, the consensus is that breakeven is near. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2025, before turning a profit of US$29m in 2026. So, the company is predicted to breakeven approximately 2 years from today. In order to meet this breakeven date, we calculated the rate at which the company must grow year-on-year. It turns out an average annual growth rate of 70% is expected, which is rather optimistic! If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, the company may become profitable much later than analysts predict. NasdaqCM:DCTH Earnings Per Share Growth December 29th 2024 Given this is a high-level overview, we won\u2019t go into details of Delcath Systems' upcoming projects, however, keep in mind that by and large a high growth rate is not out of the ordinary, particularly when a company is in a period of investment. Before we wrap up, there\u2019s one aspect worth mentioning. The company has managed its capital prudently, with debt making up 23% of equity. This means that it has predominantly funded its operations from equity capital, and its low debt obligation reduces the risk around investing in the loss-making company.
