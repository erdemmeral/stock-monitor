[{"text": "Aeon (M) Bhd's (KLSE:AEON) investors will be pleased with their notable 35% return over the last year editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Tue, Jan 28, 2025, 6:56 AM 3 min read If you want to compound wealth in the stock market, you can do so by buying an index fund. But one can do better than that by picking better than average stocks (as part of a diversified portfolio). For example, the Aeon Co. (M) Bhd. ( KLSE:AEON ) share price is up 31% in the last 1 year, clearly besting the market return of around 4.9% (not including dividends). That's a solid performance by our standards! The longer term returns have not been as good, with the stock price only 5.7% higher than it was three years ago. With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for Aeon (M) Bhd To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement. During the last year Aeon (M) Bhd grew its earnings per share (EPS) by 28%. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 31% increase in the share price. So this implies that investor expectations of the company have remained pretty steady. It makes intuitive sense that the share price and EPS would grow at similar rates. The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail). KLSE:AEON Earnings Per Share Growth January 28th 2025 We know that Aeon (M) Bhd has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time . What About Dividends? It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Aeon (M) Bhd the TSR over the last 1 year was 35%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return. A Different Perspective It's good to see that Aeon (M) Bhd has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 35% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 5%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Aeon (M) Bhd better, we need to consider many other factors.
