This takes the annual payment to 2.3% of the current stock price, which unfortunately is below what the industry is paying. Check out our latest analysis for East West Bancorp East West Bancorp's Payment Expected To Have Solid Earnings Coverage While yield is important, another factor to consider about a company's dividend is whether the current payout levels are feasible. East West Bancorp has established itself as a dividend paying company with over 10 years history of distributing earnings to shareholders. Past distributions do not necessarily guarantee future ones, but East West Bancorp's payout ratio of 26% is a good sign as this means that earnings decently cover dividends.

Bancorp Q4 Earnings Lag on High Provisions, Stock Falls 4.2% Zacks Equity Research Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 2:46 PM 5 min read In This Article: EWBC -2.19% FNB -2.49% Shares of East West Bancorp, Inc. EWBC lost 4.2% in the after-market trading session on lower-than-expected quarterly results. Its fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.08 lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.17. Nonetheless, the bottom line increased 4% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s level. Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar. The results were primarily aided by an increase in net interest income (NII) and non-interest income, alongside lower non-interest expenses. Also, deposit and loan balances increased sequentially in the quarter. However, higher provisions were a headwind. The quarterly results excluded certain notable items. After considering the same, net income available to common shareholders was $293.1 million or $2.10 per share, up from $239 million or $1.69 per share in the prior-year quarter. For 2024, adjusted EPS was $8.30, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.38. Also, the bottom line declined 2.8% from the previous year\u2019s level. Net income (GAAP) was $1.17 billion, up marginally from the 2023 level. Our estimate for the metric was $1.18 billion. EWBC\u2019s Revenues Rise, Expenses Fall Quarterly net revenues were $675.8 million, up 3.2% year over year. Moreover, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $654.3 million. Full-year revenues totaled $2.61 billion, up marginally year over year. The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.59 billion. NII amounted to $587.6 million, which increased 2.2% year over year. However, net interest margin (NIM) contracted 24 basis points (bps) to 3.24%. We expected NII and NIM to be $563.5 million and 3.22%, respectively. Total non-interest income was $88.2 million, up 10.3%. The improvement was driven by an increase in all the components except customer derivative revenues, lower net gains on sales of loans, lower net gains on AFS debt securities and a fall in other income. We had estimated non-interest income to be $85.8 million. Non-interest expenses totaled $250 million, down 14% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s level. The decline was mainly due to a significant fall in the deposit insurance premiums and regulatory assessments cost and amortization of tax credits and CRA investments. Our estimate for the same was $234 million. The efficiency ratio was 36.92%, down from 44.34% in the prior-year quarter. A decline in the efficiency ratio indicates an improvement in profitability. As of Dec. 31, 2024, net loans held for investment (HFI) were $53 billion, reflecting a roughly 1% rise sequentially. Total deposits increased 2.4% to $63.2 billion. Story Continues Credit Quality Deteriorates for East West Bancorp Annualized quarterly net charge-offs were 0.48% of average loans HFI, up 33 bps from the prior-year quarter\u2019s level. As of Dec. 31, 2024, non-performing assets amounted to $194.1 million, up 70.2% year over year. The provision for credit losses was $70 million, up 89.2% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s level. Our estimate for the same was $31.7 million. EWBC\u2019s Capital & Profitability Ratios Improve As of Dec. 31, 2024, the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.28%, up from 13.31% as of Dec. 31, 2023. The total risk-based capital ratio was 15.59%, up from 14.76% a year ago. At the end of the fourth quarter, the return on average assets was 1.55%, up from 1.37% as of Dec. 31, 2023. Return on average tangible equity was 16.07%, up from 15.26%. East West Bancorp\u2019s Share Repurchase Update In the reported quarter, East West Bancorp repurchased roughly 0.2 million shares for $20 million. On Jan. 22, 2025, EWBC announced an additional authorization of up to $300 million, increasing the total authorization available to $329 million. Our View on EWBC East West Bancorp is well-poised for organic growth on continued improvement in loan and deposit balances, relatively higher interest rates and diversified fee income streams. However, a rise in expenses and a weak asset quality amid a tough operating backdrop are likely to hurt the bottom line. East West Bancorp, Inc.

Q & A Highlights Q : How should we think about the investments in people and technology being layered in during the course of the year? A : Christopher Del Moral-Niles, CFO, explained that the investments are intended to prepare the bank for future growth. While expenses may appear high relative to others, they are off a smaller base, and revenue growth is expected to outstrip expense growth, resulting in positive operating leverage. Story Continues Q : Is the increase in share buyback a change in philosophy or just for future flexibility? A : Christopher Del Moral-Niles, CFO, stated that the approach remains opportunistic. The bank was opportunistic in the fourth quarter and will continue to be, with flexibility to act in the best interest of shareholders. Q : Where do you think deposit betas will shake out, and is there room for them to go down further? A : Christopher Del Moral-Niles, CFO, noted that they have been guiding to a 50% beta, and results have been consistent with that. Positive momentum is expected as long as rates are moving lower or expected to move lower. Q : What is the outlook for C&I growth, and will tariffs impact growth or investment spend? A : Christopher Del Moral-Niles, CFO, mentioned that commitments are up, indicating capacity for growth. Tariffs have not materially impacted growth in the past eight years, and customers have prepared for such scenarios. Q : What should we expect for CRE loan balances, and is there any incremental credit risk if rates rise? A : Christopher Del Moral-Niles, CFO, stated that CRE growth will be more muted, focusing on C&I and residential growth. The credit profile is strong, and modest rate increases are not expected to impact loans significantly.

Bancorp (EWBC) the Most Undervalued Bank Stock to Invest in According to Analysts? Zarah Hamid Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 5:19 PM 4 min read In This Article: EWBC -2.19% We recently published a list of 10 Most Undervalued Bank Stocks To Invest In According To Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where East West Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:EWBC) stands against other most undervalued bank stocks to invest in according to analysts. The Banking Industry\u2019s Outlook Under the Trump Admin Amidst the enthusiasm of the new President Donald Trump for digital assets, it is important to know that US banks have avoided allowing customers to use crypto for retail transactions. Regarding the banking industry\u2019s approach to digital currencies, the CEO of Bank of America, Brian Moynihan, told CNBC that if the regulators allow, the American banking industry would jump into crypto payments. Speaking on this stance, Moynihan stated: \u201cIf you go down the street here and you go in and buy lunch, right, if you can pay with\u00a0Visa,\u00a0Mastercard, a debit card,\u00a0Apple\u00a0Pay, etc., this would just be another form of payment\u201d At the same time, Trump\u2019s lighter regulatory approach is expected to reduce some of the burden on the banking industry imposed by Biden\u2019s administration and is likely to spur dealmaking. Barclays senior equity analyst Jason Goldberg told Yahoo Finance that the environment is a \u2018pro-growth, less regulation backdrop\u2019 and favorable for increased loan growth and enhanced capital market activity among banks. JPMorgan\u2019s Mary Erdoes expressed optimism for deals in the banking industry under the new admin, saying: \u201cCompanies don\u2019t want to go public or can\u2019t go public because of the heavy regulatory burden and hopefully you\u2019ll see that [change]\u201d With increased mergers and acquisitions being anticipated in the United States under the new administration, CNBC mentioned European banking leaders hoping for more deal-making activity on the continent. The chief executive of the largest bank in the Netherlands, ING, is of the opinion that too many banks in Europe deem the sector inefficient. In comparison to the US, fragmented laws across Europe tend to prevent a more efficient banking system. Simultaneously, the chief executive of Swiss bank UBS, Sergio Ermotti, thinks the policy stance taken by regulators under Trump would encourage deal-making among several small and regional banks while he considers the US authorities unlikely to weaken regulations for larger banks.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Adrienne Atkinson, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Adrienne Atkinson Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us here at East West Bancorp's fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results. With me are Dominic Ng, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Del Moral-Miles, Chief Finance Officer; and Irene Oh, Chief Risk Officer. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay on our Investor Relations site. The slide deck referenced during this call is available on our Investor Relations site. Management may make projections or other forward-looking statements, which may differ materially from the actual results due to a number of risks and uncertainties. Management may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. For a more detailed description of the risk factor and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 8-K filed today. I will now turn the call over to Dominic. Dominic Ng Thank you, Adrienne. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for today's fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I'd like to express my sympathy to everyone impacted by the wildfires in Southern California. I would also like to extend my deep gratitude to the firefighters, public service workers, and volunteers who were on the front lines and are helping with recovery and cleanup efforts. During this time of need for our city, I'm proud of the actions East West is taking to support our customers, our community, and our associates. For customers impacted by the fires, we are offering accommodation on an as needed basis to help those who are impacted, focus on the health and safety of their families and businesses. We have also contributed significant relief funds for community members and associates who were impacted by the evacuation or who lost their home. We have assessed East West exposure which is minimal at this time. With that, let me turn to our financial results on Slide 4. 2024 was another record-breaking year for East West. Our highlights include new record levels for revenue, fee income, net income, earnings per share, and loans and deposits. Our results speak to the strength of East West brand and service model. I'm particularly proud of last year's over $7 billion of deposit growth. We grew average deposits by 9% year over year and average loans by 6% and further diversifying our portfolio by emphasizing residential and C&I lending. 2024 was also a consecutive year of record fee income driven in part by consistent sales execution across our wealth management, commercial payments, and foreign exchange businesses. Asset quality remained relatively stable in 2024 with full year net charge-offs and year-end nonperforming assets, both of 26 basis points. We maintain a disciplined approach to credit management in the fourth quarter but dealt with two problem credits, which Irene will elaborate on later. We believe these occurrence to be isolated events and are diligently pursuing recovery efforts. We remain vigilant about managing our credit risk and are proactively managing our risk profile. We delivered substantial returns for shareholders. In 2024, we reported tangible book value per share growth of 13% and generated a 17% return on tangible common equity. We were opportunistic in the fourth quarter and repurchased 200,000 shares at an average price of $98 per share. I'm also pleased to announce we approved an incremental share repurchase authorization of $300 million and a 9% increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.60 per share. Let me turn it to Chris for more details on the balance sheet and income statement. Story Continues Christopher Del Moral-Niles Thank you, Dominic. Let me start with deposits on slide 5. Over the past five years, East West growth has been deposit-led. This has allowed us to fund loans while maintaining strong balance sheet liquidity. In 2024, East West grew end-of-period deposits by 13% to a record $63.2 billion. In early 2024, we also repaid $4.5 billion of BTFP borrowings driven by our confidence in our ability to grow core deposits. During the fourth quarter, we saw a notable uptick in DDA and money market balances with continued overall stability in savings and time deposits. Our deposit mix has stabilized with DDA levels in the mid-20s. Our period-end total deposit costs declined a further 25 basis points in the fourth quarter to 2.59%. Looking into Q1, our 2025 Lunar New Year CD special was launched last week, offering a six-month CD at 4.18% and a nine-month CD at 4.08%. We believe these are competitive for our regional markets, and we expect good retention and potentially good traction on new money inflows at these price points. Notably, these levels are 107 and 117 basis points below last year's CD offering at 5.25%. Turning to loans on slide 6. East West grew total average loans by 6% for the year and end of period loan by 3%, in line with our prior guidance. C&I growth in the fourth quarter was driven by new credits as utilization was relatively stable quarter-over-quarter. Although we have yet to see evidence of increased demand in Q1, we expect C&I growth to pick up later in 2025 given the improving overall business sentiment. Residential mortgage had a good quarter in Q4, partly reflecting the drop in rates we saw in the third quarter. Despite the recent backup in rates, pipelines remain full going into the first quarter. We expect residential mortgage growth to continue at its current pace. Overall, we expect 2025 loan growth to be in the range of 4% to 6%, driven by strong growth in C&I production and continued residential mortgage strengths, leading to a further diversified and more balanced loan portfolio over time. Shifting to net interest income and net interest margin on slide 7. And as we guided, NII rebounded in the back half of the year, driven primarily by lower total deposit costs. Our net interest margin was stable at 3.24%, while our interest rate spread widened 9 basis points quarter over quarter. At the end of the fourth quarter, our end-of-period interest-bearing deposit costs have come down 49 basis points from the second quarter consistent with our expected 50% deposit beta. In the fourth quarter, our total hedges cost us $18 million of net interest income or 10 basis points to NIM. In January, $0.5 billion of negative carry swaps rolled off and a further $0.5 billion is set to roll off in February. These two maturities will alleviate approximately half of our negative hedge impact. The benefit of these hedges rolling off, our expected balance sheet growth, and our improving deposit costs and mix should combine to support net interest income and margin levels from here. Our outlook for net interest income assumes [two 25-basis-point] cuts during 2025, resulting in a gradually steeping yield curve as the implied year-end curves suggested. Moving on to fee income. Fee income grew by 11% over the last four years and grew by 12% in 2024. As Dominic mentioned, we achieved record fee income in 2024. Our strength over the past year was driven by sales execution in wealth management and foreign exchange and strong traction in treasury management sales, particularly around commercial payments activity. East West has been consistently growing wealth management, foreign exchange and deposit account fees at over 20% per year, and we remain focused on driving this growth as we look into 2025. Taking NII and fee income together, we expect total revenue growth in 2025 in the order of 5% to 7%. Turning now to expenses on slide 9. East West continue to deliver industry-leading efficiency. Fourth-quarter efficiency ratio was 36.9%. Excluding FDIC special deposit insurance assessment charges, total operating noninterest expenses have grown on average at an 8% clip over the past five years, including in 2024. This is in line with our expectations for 2025. Expense growth is expected to be driven primarily by investments in our people and tech to support our growth strategies. Now, I'll hand the call over to Irene for some comments on credit and capital. Irene Oh Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon to all on the call. As shown on slide 10, the credit environment is benign and the asset quality of our portfolio as a whole remains solid. Provision for credit losses increased $28 million from the third quarter to $70 million. Net charge-offs in the fourth quarter were $64 million. The net charge-offs for the fourth quarter largely stemmed from two domestic commercial and industrial credits. These two credits were unrelated, but both loans were made to companies in the technology sector, and we had determined in the fourth quarter that the collateral and AR were not collectible. Nonperforming assets remained stable at 26 basis points of total assets quarter-over-quarter. The special mention loan ratio improved slightly to 83 basis points, while the classified loans ratio increased 15 basis points to 135 basis points. The absolute level of problem loans, migration into criticized loan categories, and nonperforming loans remain low and at manageable levels. Regarding the wildfires in Los Angeles, we are actively accessing our exposure from the Palisades and Eaton Canyon fires. Based on what we currently know, we expect our direct exposure to be minimal. To date, we have identified 32 loans totaling $26 million outstanding that are impacted. These are largely consumer mortgage loans but the numbers are inclusive of any direct exposure in entire loan portfolio, including collateral commercial real estate, multifamily, and commercial and industrial loans. Further, our gross exposures to loans in the vicinity of the Hughes fire just north of Los Angeles is very limited. Based on these preliminary results from the impact of the wildfires, we foresee very limited credit impact to East West at this time. We remain vigilant and proactive in managing our credit risk. Based on what we know today, we are projecting that full-year 2025 net charge-offs to be in the range of 25 to 35 basis points. As seen on slide 11, our allowance for credit losses ended the fourth quarter at $702 million or 1.31%, unchanged from the prior quarter-end. We believe our loan portfolio is appropriately reserved as of December 31, 2024. Turning to slide 12. East West regulatory capital ratios remain well in excess of regulatory requirements for well-capitalized institutions and well above regional bank averages. East West Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio stands at a robust 14.3%, while the tangible common equity ratio is at 9.6%. Our Board of Directors has declared a first quarter of 2025 common stock dividend of $0.60 per share, a 9% increase to the dividend. The dividend will be payable on February 17 to stockholders of record on February 3. East West opportunistically repurchased 200,000 shares of common stock during the fourth quarter of 2024 for $20 million. Additionally, our Board has approved a new $300 million repurchase authorization, resulting in $329 million of total current authorization available. I will now turn it back to Chris to share a few comments on our outlook for the full year. Chris? Christopher Del Moral-Niles Thank you, Irene. With respect to our guidance, as previously mentioned, our outlook assumes modest economic growth, and further cuts of 50 basis points over the course of 2025, consistent with the year-end yield curve. We expect end-of-period loans to grow in the range of 4% to 6% with continued relative strength in both C&I and residential lending. We expect net interest income to grow in the range of 4% to 6%, driven by balance sheet growth and total revenue growth in the range of 5% to 7% bolstered by our continued momentum in our fee income businesses. Total operating expenses are expected to increase in the range of 7% to 9% year over year, driven primarily by headcount and IT-related expenditures, offset partly by lower expected deposit account expenses. Again, we expect full-year net charge-offs in the range of 25 to 35 basis points and our effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 23%. With that, now let me open the call up for questions. Operator? Question and Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions) Jared Shaw. Barclays. Jared Shaw Yes, good afternoon, everybody. Any aggressive injured. Tom, maybe just starting with the expense guide. When you when you look at the investments in people and technology that you're that you're highlighting, how should we think about that are being layered and during the course of the year and as most of that in preparation for category for or how are you sort of describe the color around around the investments there? Christopher Del Moral-Niles Yes, I think we continue to make the investments we need to be for the bank. We expect to be over the coming years and we expect the bank will be a strong capable, 10 well positioned bank to meet all of them needs of our customers signed. I would note that our expense percentage is high relative perhaps to some others, but keep in mind, it's also the much smaller base. And so our implied revenue growth far outstrips even the larger percent expense growth at least a positive operating leverage. Jared Shaw Okay, great. Thanks for that color. And then I guess it's great to see the announcement of a buyback or increasing the buyback. But when we look at it in light of sort of the limited amount of repurchase that you've done in the past, should we think that this is a change? And Tom, the philosophy around utilizing the buyback with this capital ratio level? Or is it more you just want to have the flexibility in the future to buy back stock if and if something changes? Christopher Del Moral-Niles Philosophy here has been opportunistic. We were opportunistic in the fourth quarter will continue to be opportunistic, but we certainly like the price points that we saw in the fourth quarter. And we have plenty of flexibility to do what's the best interests of our shareholders. Jared Shaw Is that opportunistic view only around the share price? Or is that more broader view of potentially seeing lower capital ratios? Christopher Del Moral-Niles I think we operate from a position of capital strength that has served the Company very, very well. Being the better capitalized banks in the industry allows us to withstand whatever comes and gives us the bank, the flexibility to be here for our customers regardless of the economic or rate environment. It's out there and regardless of events like fires that may tragically impacts some of our customers being here with that strength is a differentiator for East West. And if we weren't earning a 17% returns on tangible capital, it would be of concern. But since we've been able to do that consistently year in year out for years, think it's a great place to be. Jared Shaw Great. Thank you for that. Operator Manan Gosalia, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Manan Gosalia Hi, good afternoon. So that may have high. I wanted to start on deposit costs said they're down nicely, 50 basis points or so on the interest-bearing side apps, I guess you're getting a 50% beta. There have had some of your CDs will have to reprice lower still? Or where do you think we should be a shakeout on deposit beta? She has a lot more room for that to go down from here. Christopher Del Moral-Niles Manan, we've been guiding to about a 50% beta, and we're pleased to see that the results of the last couple of quarters have been consistent with that. I think we'll continue to see positive momentum on that as long as rates are moving lower expected the new lower. And so we have that benefit that the CDs effectively, we priced a little bit go ahead the actual Fed cuts. And so that will continue to be up to our benefit here over the near term. We'll see where things shake out, what the yield curve as we get later into the back half here. Manan Gosalia I think last quarter you noted that $20 billion or so of the $23 billion in CDs were due to price in the next three quarters. Have you have that number for half of the end of the fourth quarter? Christopher Del Moral-Niles Yes, no, there's $10 billion repricing in Q1 and another [$7 billion-ish, $8 billion-ish] in inflation in Q2. And then it drops off to less than [2] in Q3. Manan Gosalia Got it. Okay. And maybe as a follow-up on loan growth, I know you noted that you expect C&I to us to pick up with improving business sentiment. And can you give us some more color on what you're seeing there and maybe US tariffs are rolled through, how would that have an impact on growth or investment spend among your client base. Christopher Del Moral-Niles I think I heard the first part of your question is sort of what's driving our positive outlook with business sentiment. And the reality is, as permits are up 5% year over year. So we know there's dry powder and our customers' capacity to draw. And there's active dialogue with a number of customers across the number of industries, obviously have a strong attachment business. We have positive outlook on that. We'll wait to see with the private equity market does probably rate dependent, but we know that they'll be interest in a variety of projects and opportunities as we move through the year and in the amount of time kind of goes along. The second part of your question, Manan, and mix may be I repeat it? Manan Gosalia So it was just if tariffs were to impact that outlook. Christopher Del Moral-Niles And as point in time, as we look back over the last eight years, the overall growth in the balance sheet, both on the loan and deposit side was favorably impacted by both the introduction of tariffs and the extension of tariffs under the Biden administration. And so the reality is at this point in time, we don't have a reason to believe it will have a material impact. Obviously, I think we're all waiting to see what tariffs ultimately come to pass based on what we've seen so far. And there's a flooring business in order. So I may have missed some. We don't expect much at this point in time. But in any case, our customers have had eight years on their own to prepare for these. Many of them have we are going their supply chains. Many of them have prepared themselves for the expectation here, tariffs. And so the reality is I think many of our customers have taken a proactive stance to managing their business and we're being supportive in whatever way we can. But that's for a politician to decide where they land on that were just to support our customers. Dominic Ng I just wanted to add just on the record and for the last eight years, East West Bank did not make any kind of M&A activity, acquisition and whatnot. And but we were able to grow our deposit at an annual growth rate of 10%. And on the deposit side, coincidentally, we also were able to all our deposit on an annual basis at 10%. So we actually pretty much all grew most of our competitors at our peer group while we've not even use any kind of M&A activities to supplement that. So and that's kind of like as give you a pretty good perspective that up can have more tariffs world, how global tariff, whatever wildly somehow east-west, and we'll be able to figure out how to navigate. I really think that at the end of the day, it gets back down to knowledge and expertise and recognizing where the path that East West should take and to appropriately find ways to grow organically. We've done that for the last eight years, and we'll feel very comfortable that in the next four years, we will be able to find ways to continue our successful growth. Manan Gosalia I appreciate that. Thank you. Operator Ebrahim Poonawala, Bank of America ML. Ebrahim Poonawala Good afternoon. I guess maybe first on just commercial real estate. So how do you comments on loan growth? Remind us what we should expect on CRE loan balances? Are those drawings? Are they going to be running off? And that's probably the netting out in terms of your loan growth guidance and if rates remain where they are in the coal moves down by another 30, 50 basis points here in the early book. Christopher Del Moral-Niles So Eb, if you look at the last quarter of last year, total CRE balances are actually down a bit over both periods and we are focusing on growing our C&I and residential. And yes, we expect CRE growth will be more muted as we move forward. From a credit risk perspective, I think we would say we have a very strong credit profile and book. Obviously, lower rates helps many of our customers in that space. Higher rates would hurt. Some of the good news is as the pages in the appendix of our materials. So our LTVs are such and our average loan sizes are such that in many cases, a small rate impacts will have no impact or keep in mind these customers were paying when rates were 100 basis points higher. They won't really have that many issues. We hope as we move forward and in any case, we're working with our customers to make sure we are ready for whatever changes they face and help them through. Irene Oh EBITDA was also specifically an answer to your question. I am hopeful that kind of modest increase in long-term rates will impact silos in our portfolio. That was how to the short term. Ebrahim Poonawala Helpful. Thank you. And I guess just a follow-up, Chris, to your point about on a dollar basis, I think you mentioned revenue should expect to exceed expenses going up this year. But given sort of this preparation for cash for other investments you're making is the efficiency ratio generally trending? I mean, again, it's best in class status today, but I'm wondering, should we be thinking about it in terms of the efficiency ratio, maybe drift higher over the next few years? Are this is just limited to this year in terms of the guidance? Christopher Del Moral-Niles If we look back over the last several years, it's been growing at a faster clip. So I think the reality is we're acknowledging the pace that we've been on for the last several years and expecting 2025 won't be materially different. We have a long-term vision for investing in the platforms and people's to make us the bank. We want to be we're going to get there. I don't know that that means of change anything about our long-term philosophy about being best-in-class efficiency. And I don't expect it to materially change the average exactly what we've been on for efficiency over the last several years, we've been able to grow, make the investments we needed to make and deliver consistent profitability over that the last decade plus last three decades under David's leadership, I think we can continue that for several years ago. Dominic Ng Let me add by saying that, you know, obviously for us we would pay more attention to return on equity, return on asset earning per share growth, et cetera. Efficiency is one of the components that we obviously have it available to share with the public is not for me as a high priority. Let me put it this way. The reason I say this is that all while we are growing will continue to expand into all the price product and fee revenues. And when you change the business model gradually, Esaase would never do anything dramatically. So we don't have to worry about that. That's why you see our consistent and high performance year-in, year-out quarter after quarter record breaking out the record-breaking. So you wouldn't have to worry about suddenly we call pivot to a direction that's shocking, everybody. But while we had not to go into that direction, you may notice that we keep it calling now these record fee incomes for of management, record fee incomes for cash management, fee income, foreign exchange, et cetera, et cetera, by is that we will continue to build our capabilities, our talents and continuing to acquire more clients that will actually up utilize these products that generate fee income for us. While we're doing that, I think the expense ratio will be different and a predominantly loans and deposits shop by. So the key really come back down to. So we thought actually diversifying that income stream. What does that mean? My position is that we know exactly was the healthiest way to go East West Bank balance sheet and our P & L. And we understand how we should look at our performance comparing with our peers. And as long as we continue to outperform our peers and fit into the top quartile with good. So that's the reason why I look at is if the efficiency ratio level from 36, 40% are not a big deal. And quite frankly, right now, it looks ridiculously low right now. So I'm not too worried about it. Ebrahim Poonawala Very clear. Thank you. Operator Timur Brazilier, Wells Fargo. Timur Brazilier Hi, good afternoon. I am just looking at some of the loans that were affected by the wildfires from just remind us of the insurance requirements for your SFR book specifically. And then maybe just walk us through kind of the time line of insurance collections and what the obligations Thank might be to the impact of borrowers and so on. Irene Oh A great question, Timur. And as we look at the exposure and a lot on, I can also say affirmatively that all impacted properties on are covered under hasn't. I hope that adequate all we've gone through this in the past as well. I had mentioned, I think the wildfires, let's say, in 2020 or beyond, you have at the end of the day, the track record that we have is we really don't have much impact because we make sure that the housing issuance and they're placing placed on the property. The LTVs are low. Borrowers have enough equity to EBITDA of. But realistically Steve can take time and also especially for mortgages, consumer loans with our people live in these home. This is certainly something that we will accommodate our customers' end. Timur Brazilier Okay. And then maybe this is hard to kind of frame, but just looking at the impact on the small business side and potential CNI impact, how do you start to frame some of that potential disruption? And maybe what are some of the expectations for East West to participate late in the recovery process? Irene Oh Yes, great question at first blush, as we're looking at our portfolios, this review also included commercial and industrial loans of five businesses fall or located in the impacted areas are businesses that might have had collateral in malls impacted areas. As you know, we have any C&I loans were all the Apama analyzed all of the day. Any unplanned told one related to the actual business sort of unlock correspondent. We're very comfortable and those factors are included in the mineralization there, small businesses that impact your number one, we are reaching out to the customers to get that information thus far. I saw it again, small business owners are part of the community. And if there are things that we need to do to accommodate, we'll certainly look at that. Timur Brazilier Great. And then just lastly, at how do you want to add? Dominic Ng There are substantial assistance coming from of federal, state and local government. And so I mean, obviously for small business, no SBA south there, you know how ready to stand by for relief and then female, et cetera. So just a it's not only East-West that we are more than happy to provide flexible solution to accommodate all of our small business customers, but also that since Alba out there plenty of all of our resources that I'll be ready to support these out customers that are impacted by the wildfires. Timur Brazilier Great. And then just last for me. Looking at them at the end of period balance versus the average on both are up and the period, obviously up much more. I'm just wondering, does all of that stick around until the first quarter or some of that end-of-period growth in DDA transitory in nature? Christopher Del Moral-Niles For sure. We have some year end transitory deposits, but I think we draw comfort from is as we sit here three weeks into the quarter, our DDA mix seems to stabilize where we are, and we think it probably is on a positive trajectory as we move forward. Timur Brazilier Great. Thank you. Operator Ben Gerlinger, Citi. Please go ahead. Ben Gerlinger Hey, good afternoon to everyone. It's kind of follows on from a low sequential, we think about just the CD repricing are nowhere near your special has already started earlier is actually next week. I'm pretty sure you have sort of hydro off. I think it was mid quarter, certainly favor. Just kind of the net impact outside it's kind of loans and deposits. I guess you're saying, can you give us some color kind of what you're expecting margin might be for 1Q 2Q just because we wanted to have so much noise in it? Christopher Del Moral-Niles Yes. I mean, I think the short answer is it'll get better. So the reality is we don't expect much if anything on the rate action side in Q1. We set out the forward said, we know the hedges are rolling off and we know that we're going to replace some deposits still lower. So all of that's positives. Ben Gerlinger Got you. Okay. That is helpful. And everything else has been asked and answered. So appreciate your time, sir. Operator Chris McGratty, KBW. Chris McGratty Great, thanks. Hearing the slide 13 on the expense guide, is the starting point dollar like this gap ex tax credit or the adjustments for kind of one-offs that happened during years longer than a starting point? Christopher Del Moral-Niles There is a small. There was a small amount out of SVICE. So I think we're focusing here on the operating knowledge expense line. If you look at slide 10, the some of the press release tables that number as the base and that includes the efficacy land. But obviously, we don't expect any FDIC special assessment as we look forward. So that's sort of a baseline for you folks up. Chris McGratty Okay. And then within that, the could you help on the tax amortization that's that's backed and are baked into that guide? Christopher Del Moral-Niles So actually the taxation Next line below that. So that's why we focus on the operating noninterest expense growth. Another important element in place. Chris McGratty But for 2025, I'm just trying to get the rights amortization done in the adjusted line? Christopher Del Moral-Niles I'll probably be closer to what I didn't specifically guide on that. I mean, our tax rate will be in that 21 to 23 range. But we don't think tax amortization is poised to move or be as volatile as an investor. That's part of why we adopted the PAM accounting we adopted and you're going to be a more normalized number in the range. This was 2024. on the actual investment made, but it will offset in the tax plan. Chris McGratty Understood. Okay, great. And then I'm going to have on the capital. You kind of capital use commentary on, are there any businesses are from non-interest income opportunities that you would consider to diversify the revenues and deploy some capital? Dominic Ng Anything that we will consider, but it's a high bar. The recent news that we've done pretty well for the impact of the last 10 years, we have made an acquisition. And so the way I looked at it is there anything that we wanted to do in terms of inorganic growth related to some extent, while we nearly have can have a positive impact to the balance sheet and or possibly even P&L, that the challenge is a distraction from our focus of running our business. We've done really well and what we'll end just focusing on growing organically. So that's why I'd say it's a high ball. It would not be easy to find these potential acquisition, I think is a lot easier for institutions will find an acquisition target when they have no ability to grow no ability to generate business. And then the easier thing to do is go pay somebody and then cut all the cost side. So for us, that's not what we did. We could actually growing business in Malaysia banking. So in that standpoint, that's what the high vol mix it up. Now what I call highly likely that we'll find the opportunity, but obviously stay we are out there, you know, keeping our eyes open. Chris McGratty Great. Thank you. Operator Gary Tenner, D.A. Davidson. Gary Tenner Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to I wanted to ask about how you're thinking about just a real balance sheet growth as your you gave the guide on loan growth, but you've got at least a part of FHLB offsetting that, I think, matures during the first quarter and the Lunar New Year special. So how are you thinking about utilizing funds which were able to have a pretty good growth quarter on the deposit side? Would you use some to condemn FHLB or would you plan to roll that each other? Christopher Del Moral-Niles So I think we're I think we think about our balance sheet growth because of the desired end state of being here always to support our customers first and foremost, with whatever their borrowing needs may be and always have that liquidity in the funding to make that readily available. Second, we'd look at opportunistically continue to manage and invest and liquidity levels. We think those are pretty strong right now. So that's not the incremental thrust at the moment, but we'll continue to evaluate that with changing market conditions. And then yes, the pay down our other higher cost borrowings or other higher cost deposits within our portfolio. And so as we sit here today, we're optimistic that we'll get good traction on the lunar CD special. And as that produces additional excess funding beyond our borrowing growth will certainly be looking at how best to join us. Gary Tenner And these are at how much of that of the floating part of the FHLB matures in the first quarter. Christopher Del Moral-Niles There's $1 billion that comes due later in the quarter, and we'll have the opportunity to see how much we've gone but paydown or will that perfect. Includes only has to time that actually is to make sure we may have time to maturities to make sure we have that flexibility around the time of our expected to see the campaigns. Operator This will conclude our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Dominic Ng for any closing remarks. Dominic Ng I'd just like to thank everyone for joining our call today, and we are looking forward to speaking with you in April. Thank you. Operator The conference has now concluded.

Earnings Growth Zacks Equity Research Mon, Jan 20, 2025, 6:00 PM 5 min read In This Article: EWBC -2.19% Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Bank of Marin (BMRC) reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates. The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 27, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This bank holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.34 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +13.3%. Revenues are expected to be $28.4 million, up 35.4% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.15% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts. Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Story Continues Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Bank of Marin? For Bank of Marin, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +6.67%. On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2. So, this combination indicates that Bank of Marin will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue? While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Bank of Marin would post earnings of $0.27 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.28, delivering a surprise of +3.70%. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once. Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Bank of Marin appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release. An Industry Player's Expected Results Another stock from the Zacks Banks - West industry, East West Bancorp (EWBC), is soon expected to post earnings of $2.13 per share for the quarter ended December 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +5.5%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $654.31 million, down 0.1% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus EPS estimate for East West Bancorp has been revised 0.3% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.47%. This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that East West Bancorp will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.

Aid COF's Q4 Earnings Amid Rising Provisions Zacks Equity Research Mon, Jan 20, 2025, 5:25 PM 5 min read In This Article: COF -1.37% Capital One COF is slated to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results on Jan. 21, after market close. Its quarterly earnings and revenues are expected to have witnessed an increase on a year-over-year basis. Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar. In the last reported quarter, COF\u2019s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The results gained from a rise in net interest income (NII) and higher loans and deposits. An increase in expenses and higher provisions, alongside lower non-interest income, were the undermining factors. Capital One does not have an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one quarter and lagged in three of the trailing four quarters. Capital One Financial Corporation Price and Consensus Capital One Financial Corporation Price and Consensus Capital One Financial Corporation price-consensus-chart | Capital One Financial Corporation Quote Key Factors Driving COF\u2019s Q4 Performance & Estimates NII: Since September 2024, the Federal Reserve has reduced interest rates by 100 basis points (bps). This is likely to have positively impacted COF\u2019s NII during the quarter. Further, the yield curve steepened and then normalized during the quarter. This is likely to have reduced funding costs somewhat, though they\u2019re still expected to remain high due to deposit repricing lag. The overall lending scenario improved during the quarter, with a rise in demand for consumer loans. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total average earning assets of $459.5 billion indicates a 2.8% rise from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported figure. Our estimate for the metric is $453.8 billion. Also, Capital One\u2019s efforts to strengthen its card operations are expected to have provided some support. The consensus estimate for NII of $8.12 billion indicates 8% growth. Our estimate for NII is pegged at $7.92 billion. Fee Income: Capital One\u2019s interchange fees (constituting more than 60% of fee income) are likely to have improved in the quarter under review, given increased card usage. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for interchange fees is $1.29 billion, suggesting a 5.9% increase. Our estimate for the metric is $1.31 billion. The consensus estimate for service charges and other customer-related fees of $478.3 million implies 12.8% growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for other non-interest income is pegged at $309.1 million, indicating a 20.8% year-over-year decline. Our estimates for service charges and other customer-related fees, and other non-interest income are $466.6 million and $281.2 million, respectively. The consensus estimate for total non-interest income of $2.04 billion suggests a rise of 2.6% from the prior-year quarter. We expect the metric to be $2.06 billion. Expenses: Capital One has been witnessing a persistent rise in expenses over the past several quarters because of higher marketing costs. The company\u2019s investment in technology upgrades leads to higher costs. These, along with inflation pressure, are expected to have resulted in an increase in operating expenses in the fourth quarter. Also, the pending acquisition of Discover Financial Services is expected to have incurred some merger-related charges in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for total non-interest expenses stands at $5.97 billion, implying a year-over-year increase of 4.4%. In the fourth quarter of 2024, management expects operating expenses to rise sequentially, in line with the historical pattern, as the company continues to invest in technology upgrades. Asset Quality: Capital One is expected to have set aside a decent amount for potential bad loans on account of a higher for longer interest rate backdrop and inflationary pressure. Story Continues Our estimate for provision for credit losses is pegged at $2.77 billion, indicating a 3.2% fall from the year-ago quarter.

COF\u2019s 2024 Outlook The company expects total marketing investments in the second half of 2024 to be higher than the first half.

to Support Interactive Brokers in Q4 Earnings 1 / 2 Growth in AUM to Support Ameriprise This Earnings Season Zacks Equity Research Mon, Jan 20, 2025, 4:56 PM 4 min read In This Article: IBKR +2.78% Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. IBKR is scheduled to announce fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results on Jan. 21, after market close. Its quarterly earnings and revenues are expected to have improved year over year. Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar . Interactive Brokers\u2019 third-quarter 2024 earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Higher expenses hurt the company's results. On the other hand, higher total GAAP net revenues, growth in customer accounts and an increase in daily average revenue trades (DARTs) acted as tailwinds. IBKR has a decent earnings surprise history. The company\u2019s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and missed in two. Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. Quote IBKR\u2019s Earnings & Sales Projections for Q4 The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IBKR\u2019s earnings has moved 8.8% north to $1.86 per share over the past 30 days. The estimate indicates a 22.4% rise from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported number. The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $1.38 billion, suggesting an increase of 20.8%. Interactive Brokers\u2019 Other Key Q4 Estimates Client activity was solid during the fourth quarter, with the major indexes touching all-time highs several times, driven by the U.S. presidential election results and subsequent bullish sentiments. This, along with robust DART numbers in all three months of the quarter, is expected to have supported Interactive Brokers\u2019 commission revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for commission revenues is pegged at $456.7 million, indicating a 31.2% jump from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for the metric is $422.6 million. Additionally, relatively high interest rates are expected to have supported IBKR\u2019s net interest income (NII) in the to-be-reported quarter. The Federal Reserve lowered the interest rates by 100 basis points last year, but this is less likely to adversely impact the company\u2019s NII. Thus, the consensus estimate for NII is $822.4 million, implying a 12.7% increase. We project NII to be $815.2 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for other loss is pegged at $10.5 million against other income of $6 million in the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for other loss is the same as the consensus number. On the cost front, total operating expenses are likely to have remained elevated as IBKR invests in key areas to enhance platform capabilities, drive product innovation, improve customer support and build upon regulatory and compliance functions. We anticipate total non-interest expenses of $318.7 million, indicating a fall of 1.3% year over year.

"East West Bancorp (EWBC) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy? Zacks Equity Research Thu, Jan 16, 2025, 6:00 PM 5 min read In This Article: EWBC -2.19% The market expects East West Bancorp (EWBC) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates. The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 23, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This bank holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +5.5%. Revenues are expected to be $654.31 million, down 0.1% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.29% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts. Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Story Continues Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for East West Bancorp? For East West Bancorp, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.47%. On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3. So, this combination indicates that East West Bancorp will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue? Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that East West Bancorp would post earnings of $2.05 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.09, delivering a surprise of +1.95%. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times. Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. East West Bancorp appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release. Expected Results of an Industry Player Another stock from the Zacks Banks - West industry, Zions (ZION), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.26 per share for the quarter ended December 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -2.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $791.67 million, up 6.8% from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Zions has been revised 0.1% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 2.13%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate. This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Zions will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.
