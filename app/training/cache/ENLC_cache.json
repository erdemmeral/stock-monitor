Trump 2.0's Inaugural Speech Abhinab Dasgupta Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 4:07 PM 3 min read In This Article: CNX +0.80% Since the supply shock of 2022, the energy sector has been driven by growth in oil refiners who have benefited from favorable spreads between the price of oil and its distillates. However, growth has not been limited to refiners, with explorers and producers, equipment and services gaining ground as well. Geopolitical factors have played the most significant role, as they did in 2022. The threat of a broader conflict with Iran has increased with the inauguration of President Donald J. Trump. U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil exports can compound, driving up prices. Iran remains one of the top 10 global oil producers. However, the biggest driver of growth in the sector might be Trump revoking bans on offshore oil and gas drilling in most U.S. coastal waters as he famously announced that America was going to \u201cDrill, baby, Drill\u201d in his inaugural speech. Trump\u2019s moves are being looked at as nullifying executive orders made by President Biden, which includes revoking his recent decision to bar drilling rigs in around 625 million acres of coastal waters. The Trump administration expects that new offshore oil auctions will be a way to raise federal revenue. Also, if Trump were to act on his warnings and raise tariffs by 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico \u2014 something that he has not yet officially signed but says that he expects to do by Feb. 1 \u2014 the pressure on Canadian crude prices will push oil prices up again. Oil prices were little changed on Tuesday, falling 1 cent, or 0.01%, to close at $80.14/barrel, as investors took stock of Donald Trump's visions about boosting oil and gas production in the U.S. Brent crude. WTI crude slid 60 cents, or 0.8%, to $76.79/barrel. However, with the day being a public holiday, there were no settlements. The Trump administration has withdrawn from the Paris Climate Accords, again. It will be safe to gauge that with \u201cDrill, baby, Drill\u201d being a policy direction, energy and oil in particular might be entering a phase of tremendous activity. It will be prudent to look into stocks that are currently well placed to invest into. Our Choices The stocks below flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Rank #2 (Buy).

Further Upside Left in the Stock? Zacks Equity Research Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 3:32 PM 2 min read In This Article: VLO +2.39% Valero Energy (VLO) shares ended the last trading session 4.9% higher at $133.35. The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 1.5% loss over the past four weeks. The bullishness could be attributed to the new sanctions imposed by the U.S. on Russian crude oil exports. These sanctions disrupted the global supply of oil, causing a spike in oil prices as markets anticipated tighter global supplies. Higher oil prices can improve margins for integrated refiners like VLO, as they can pass on increased costs to consumers through higher refined product prices. Additionally, Valero\u2019s refinery network and Gulf Coast operations have been significant drivers of its stock performance. This oil refiner is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.16 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -95.5%. Revenues are expected to be $30.43 billion, down 14.1% from the year-ago quarter. Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements. For Valero Energy, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 17.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. And a negative trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't usually translate into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on VLO going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The Special Meeting will be held virtually. All EnLink unitholders of record as of the close of business on Dec. 23, 2024 , will be entitled to vote their units at the Special Meeting. The EnLink Board of Directors and the Conflicts Committee of the EnLink Board of Directors unanimously recommend that unitholders vote \"FOR\" all proposals provided in detail in the definitive proxy statement. Proxy materials are expected to be mailed on or about Dec. 31, 2024 . Completion of the acquisition is subject to the approval of a majority of the outstanding EnLink common units (including common units owned by ONEOK) and other customary closing conditions. ONEOK has committed to vote its units in favor of the transaction. No ONEOK shareholder vote is required to complete the transaction. As previously announced on Nov. 24, 2024 , ONEOK will acquire all outstanding units of EnLink in a tax-free transaction in which each outstanding common unit of EnLink that ONEOK does not already own will be converted into 0.1412 shares of ONEOK common stock. The combination of ONEOK and EnLink establishes a fully integrated Permian Basin platform at scale and further expands and extends ONEOK's footprint in the Mid-Continent, North Texas and Louisiana . The transaction is expected to provide significant synergies through complementary asset positions and support ONEOK's strong balance sheet and capital allocation strategy. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, subject to approval by EnLink unitholders and other customary closing conditions.

Non-GAAP Financial Information This press release contains non-generally accepted accounting principles financial measures that we refer to as adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow after distributions (FCFAD). We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus (less) interest expense, net of interest income; depreciation and amortization; impairments; (income) loss from unconsolidated affiliate investments; distributions from unconsolidated affiliate investments; (gain) loss on disposition of assets; (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt; (gain) loss on litigation settlement; unit-based compensation; income tax expense (benefit); unrealized (gain) loss on commodity derivatives; costs associated with the relocation of processing facilities; accretion expense associated with asset retirement obligations; transaction costs; non-cash expense related to changes in the fair value of contingent consideration; (non-cash rent); and (non-controlling interest share of adjusted EBITDA from joint ventures). We define free cash flow after distributions as adjusted EBITDA, net to ENLC, plus (less) (growth and maintenance capital expenditures, excluding capital expenditures that were contributed by other entities and relate to the non-controlling interest share of our consolidated entities); (interest expense, net of interest income); (distributions declared on common units); (cash distributions earned by the Series B Preferred Units and the Series C Preferred Units); (payment to redeem mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest); (costs associated with the relocation of processing facilities, excluding costs that were contributed by other entities and relate to the non-controlling interest share of our consolidated entities); non-cash interest (income)/expense; (contributions to investment in unconsolidated affiliates); (payments to terminate interest rate swaps); (current income taxes); (earnout payments related to the Amarillo Rattler Acquisition and the Central Oklahoma Acquisition); (non-cash gain associated with a lease modification); and proceeds from the sale of equipment and land. EnLink believes these measures are useful to investors because they may provide users of this financial information with meaningful comparisons between current results and previously-reported results and a meaningful measure of the company's cash flow after it has satisfied the capital and related requirements of its operations.

Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow after distributions, as defined above, are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP. They should not be considered in isolation or as an indicator of EnLink's performance. Furthermore, they should not be seen as a substitute for metrics prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the following tables.

ENLC -0.21% OKE +1.55% Consideration of 0.1412 shares of ONEOK common stock for each outstanding publicly held EnLink common unit TULSA, Okla. , Nov. 24, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) (\"ONEOK\") and EnLink Midstream, LLC (NYSE: ENLC) (\"EnLink\") today announced that they have executed a definitive merger agreement under which ONEOK will acquire all of the outstanding publicly held common units of EnLink for $4.3 billion in ONEOK common stock. ONEOK, Inc. logo Under the agreement, each outstanding common unit of EnLink that ONEOK does not already own will be converted into 0.1412 shares of ONEOK common stock. The exchange ratio was derived by dividing $15.75 per unit, equal to EnLink's market close price on Nov. 22, 2024 , by ONEOK's 10-day volume-weighted average price (VWAP). In the aggregate, ONEOK will issue approximately 37.0 million shares in connection with the proposed transaction, representing approximately 6.0% of the total ONEOK shares outstanding upon consummation of the transaction. The Board of Directors of the managing member of EnLink (the \"EnLink Board\") delegated to the Conflicts Committee of such board, consisting of three independent directors, the authority to review, evaluate, negotiate and approve the transaction. The EnLink Conflicts Committee, after evaluating the transaction with its independent legal and financial advisors, unanimously determined that the transaction is in the best interests of EnLink and the public unitholders and approved the transaction. The EnLink Conflicts Committee recommended approval of the transaction to the EnLink Board, which also unanimously approved the transaction. Subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, completion of the transaction is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2025. The completion of the merger is subject to the approval of a majority of the outstanding EnLink common units (including common units owned by ONEOK) and other customary closing conditions. ONEOK has committed to vote its units, representing approximately 44% of the outstanding EnLink common units, in favor of the transaction. No ONEOK shareholder vote is required to complete the transaction. In addition, no further regulatory approval is necessary, as ONEOK filed under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in connection with its previously announced acquisition of the controlling interest in EnLink, and the necessary waiting period, including for this transaction, has been completed. \"This tax-free transaction to acquire the remaining outstanding EnLink units is expected to be accretive to ONEOK shareholders and provide EnLink unitholders with significantly greater trading liquidity and an attractive dividend yield,\" said Pierce H. Norton II , ONEOK president and chief executive officer. Story Continues \"ONEOK has a longstanding reputation as being intentional in building a premier energy infrastructure company. This next step further solidifies that status, allowing us to continue expanding and extending our value chain, while creating value for our stakeholders.\" On Oct. 15, 2024 , ONEOK announced the successful completion of its acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners' (GIP) entire interest in EnLink for a total cash consideration of approximately $3.3 billion .
