This global report on Lipid Nutrition (Nutritional Lipids) analyzes the market based on product type, source, form and application. In addition to providing profiles of major companies operating in this space, the latest corporate and industrial developments have been covered to offer a clear panorama of how and where the market is progressing. The global demand for Lipid Nutrition (Nutritional Lipids) was estimated at US$14.3 billion in 2024 and is expected to exhibit a 2024-2030 CAGR of 9.1% in reaching a projected US$24 billion by 2030. The worldwide demand for Lipid Nutrition is poised to post a robust growth over the analysis period owing to several reasons, including the rise in obesity and cardiovascular disease incidence, increasing knowledge of nutritious and practical foods that enhances the gut health & muscle growth, growth of the nutraceutical sector, growing need for infant formula and rising population of aged. Nutritional Lipids Regional Market Analysis The Nutritional Lipids market is dominated by North America with a share of 35% in 2024, owing to existing well-established health and wellness products, high degree of consumer health consciousness, a thriving dietary supplement sector, an increasing demand for functional foods especially Omega-3 fatty acids, which are rich in lipids and have become increasingly popular because of their proven advantages for heart health and cognitive function. On the other hand, Asia-Pacific is anticipated to be the fastest growing region globally with a CAGR of 11.4% during 2024-2030 due to the rising of the middle class, rising disposable income, greater consumer knowledge of dietary supplements, the expansion of the dietary supplement & pharmaceutical industries, increased prevalence of chronic conditions, such as diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease. Nutritional Lipids Market Analysis by Product Type Based on the Type of Lipid Nutrition, Omega-3 segment is expected to lead the market with largest share of 37.9% in 2024. The major reasons for this comprise the numerous health benefits offered, including reducing inflammation, improving heart health, improving cognitive function, mitigating the risk of heart disease and managing rheumatoid arthritis. However, Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCTs) is anticipated to be the fastest growing type in the global market for Lipid Nutrition, owing to more usage of MCTs in diets than traditional fats, which will boost consumer demand for the product. Story Continues Nutritional Lipids Market Analysis by Application Worldwide, Dietary Supplements & Nutraceuticals hold the largest share of 56% in the global demand for Nutritional Lipids. There are many reasons to support the growth of Dietary Supplements in the market, which include an expanding population requiring more supplements and customers turning to nutritional lipids to lead healthier lifestyles and save on medical costs. However, Animal Feed is likely to be the fastest growing application for Nutritional Lipids due the greater penetration of animal nutrition products that are supported by an increase in pet ownership, immune system improvement, reduced inflammation and good skin. Lipid nutrition products, such as Omega-3 and Omega-6 are added to Animal Feed to improve overall health and livestock productivity. Nutritional Lipids Market Analysis by Source Plant-based Nutritional Lipids are expected to be the largest and fastest growing during the analysis period, owing to the rising health consciousness among customers, the growing number of vegetarians, the accessibility of raw materials and plant sources' high concentration of important lipids. Nutritional Lipids Market Analysis by Form By form, Liquid Nutritional Lipids are anticipated to corner a larger share in the global market than Powder form. Major factors for this include utilization of liquid lipids in the development of soft gel capsules, ease of intake and lack of costly processing, because of which this form would also likely record the fastest growth over the analysis period.

(NASDAQ:DOMO) is a favorite amongst the big guns editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 5:57 PM 4 min read In This Article: DOMO +4.37% Key Insights Significantly high institutional ownership implies Domo's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions A total of 7 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership Insiders own 16% of Domo Every investor in Domo, Inc. ( NASDAQ:DOMO ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 66% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk). Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Domo. See our latest analysis for Domo NasdaqGM:DOMO Ownership Breakdown January 21st 2025 What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Domo? Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. Domo already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Domo's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. NasdaqGM:DOMO Earnings and Revenue Growth January 21st 2025 Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Domo. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 13% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 12% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 8.6% by the third-largest shareholder. Joshua James, who is the second-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Chief Executive Officer. We also observed that the top 7 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 5 Growth Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Prize Goes to Samsara (NYSE:IOT) Adam Hejl Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 12:01 PM 5 min read In This Article: IOT -0.17% DOMO +4.37% HCAT -2.84% AMPL +0.57% Q3 Data Analytics Earnings Review: First Prize Goes to Samsara (NYSE:IOT) As the Q3 earnings season comes to a close, it\u2019s time to take stock of this quarter\u2019s best and worst performers in the data analytics industry, including Samsara (NYSE:IOT) and its peers. Organizations generate a lot of data that is stored in silos, often in incompatible formats, making it slow and costly to extract actionable insights, which in turn drives demand for modern cloud-based data analysis platforms that can efficiently analyze the siloed data. The 5 data analytics stocks we track reported a strong Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 2.2% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 0.9% above. In light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady as they are up 4.8% on average since the latest earnings results. Best Q3: Samsara (NYSE:IOT) One of the few public companies where Marc Andreessen is a Board member, Samsara (NYSE:IOT) provides software and hardware to track industrial equipment, assets, and fleets. Samsara reported revenues of $322 million, up 35.6% year on year. This print exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations by 3.7%. Overall, it was a very strong quarter for the company with EPS guidance for next quarter exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations and an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 EBITDA estimates. \u201cWe achieved another strong quarter of durable and efficient growth at a greater scale,\u201d said Sanjit Biswas, CEO and co-founder of Samsara. Samsara Total Revenue Samsara scored the biggest analyst estimates beat and fastest revenue growth of the whole group. The company added 170 enterprise customers paying more than $100,000 annually to reach a total of 2,303. Investor expectations, however, were likely higher than Wall Street\u2019s published projections, leaving some wishing for even better results (analysts\u2019 consensus estimates are those published by big banks and advisory firms, not the investors who make buy and sell decisions). The stock is down 14.4% since reporting and currently trades at $47.22. We think Samsara is a good business, but is it a buy today? Read our full report here, it\u2019s free. Health Catalyst (NASDAQ:HCAT) Founded by healthcare professionals Tom Burton and Steve Barlow in 2008, Health Catalyst (NASDAQ:HCAT) provides data and analytics technology to healthcare organizations, enabling them to improve care and lower costs. Health Catalyst reported revenues of $76.35 million, up 3.5% year on year, in line with analysts\u2019 expectations. The business had a strong quarter with EBITDA guidance for next quarter exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations and full-year EBITDA guidance exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations. Story Continues Health Catalyst Total Revenue Although it had a fine quarter compared its peers, the market seems unhappy with the results as the stock is down 27.7% since reporting. It currently trades at $5.96. Is now the time to buy Health Catalyst? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it\u2019s free . Weakest Q3: Amplitude (NASDAQ:AMPL) Born out of a failed voice recognition startup by founder Spenser Skates, Amplitude (NASDAQ:AMPL) is data analytics software helping companies improve and optimize their digital products. Amplitude reported revenues of $75.22 million, up 6.5% year on year, exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations by 1.5%. It was a satisfactory quarter as it also posted a solid beat of analysts\u2019 EBITDA estimates but a significant miss of analysts\u2019 billings estimates. Interestingly, the stock is up 8.4% since the results and currently trades at $11.38. Read our full analysis of Amplitude\u2019s results here.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Strong Momentum Stocks and add them to your watchlist.
