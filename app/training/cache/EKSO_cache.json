(NASDAQ:EKSO)? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sun, Jan 19, 2025, 5:28 PM 3 min read In This Article: EKSO -2.45% With the business potentially at an important milestone, we thought we'd take a closer look at Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc.'s ( NASDAQ:EKSO ) future prospects. Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc. designs, develops, sells, and rents exoskeleton products in the Americas, Germany, Poland, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Asia Pacific, and internationally. The US$14m market-cap company\u2019s loss lessened since it announced a US$15m loss in the full financial year, compared to the latest trailing-twelve-month loss of US$11m, as it approaches breakeven. Many investors are wondering about the rate at which Ekso Bionics Holdings will turn a profit, with the big question being \u201cwhen will the company breakeven?\u201d Below we will provide a high-level summary of the industry analysts\u2019 expectations for the company. View our latest analysis for Ekso Bionics Holdings According to the 2 industry analysts covering Ekso Bionics Holdings, the consensus is that breakeven is near. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2026, before turning a profit of US$5.4m in 2027. The company is therefore projected to breakeven around 2 years from now. What rate will the company have to grow year-on-year in order to breakeven on this date? Using a line of best fit, we calculated an average annual growth rate of 59%, which is extremely buoyant. If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, the company may become profitable much later than analysts predict. NasdaqCM:EKSO Earnings Per Share Growth January 19th 2025 Underlying developments driving Ekso Bionics Holdings' growth isn\u2019t the focus of this broad overview, though, bear in mind that generally a high forecast growth rate is not unusual for a company that is currently undergoing an investment period. One thing we\u2019d like to point out is that The company has managed its capital prudently, with debt making up 36% of equity. This means that it has predominantly funded its operations from equity capital, and its low debt obligation reduces the risk around investing in the loss-making company.
