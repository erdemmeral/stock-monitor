296 Metres of Uranium Mineralization; 8.2% U3O8 over 0.5 Metres and Multiple Intercepts Greater than 1% Newsfile Corp. Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 2:30 PM 14 min read In This Article: FDCFF -2.68% Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - January 21, 2025) - Forum Energy Metals Corp. (TSXV: FMC) (OTCQB: FDCFF) (\"Forum\" or the \"Company\") announces drill results for the Qavvik anomaly, its second basement hosted deposit located within Forum's 100% owned Aberdeen Project. This highly successful program intersected a 296-metre-wide zone of uranium mineralization with grades up to 8.2% U3O8 in a newly identified lense and resulted in more than 20 assays with grades greater than 1% U3O8. Mineralization is open to the northeast and southwest, and the shallow depths along with the thick overall uranium intercepts demonstrates the open pit potential of this deposit. With multiple drill targets on the property, the Aberdeen project has the potential to unfold into a generational uranium district. (Figure 1). HIGHLIGHTS QAV24-001 intersected a 296 m wide zone of uranium mineralization consisting of numerous discreet lenses from 36 m to 332 m, and QAV24-002 intersected over 190 m of discreet mineralized lenses from 192 m to 384 m. On the Qavvik Grid, uranium mineralization has been intersected over a 150 metre northeast-southwest trend and is open for extension of the deposit. The highest mineralization intervals from QAV24-001 are as follows: The highest mineralization intervals from QAV24-002 are as follows: Rick Mazur, CEO, commented, \"These exceptional results from our Qavvik deposit are in line with what we believe to exist in the Thelon Basin - basement and unconformity contact type deposits with the same size potential as the Athabasca Basin. With Tatiggaq only 5 km from Orano's 127 million pound Kiggavik uranium deposit and Qavvik demonstrating the potential for an economic resource, we believe that we are building a new tier one uranium district. The unconformity style alteration of the Thelon sandstone and basement rocks that has been observed at our Ned, Ayra and Loki drill targets provides even more growth potential for the project.\" Dr. Rebecca Hunter, Forum's VP, Exploration, stated, \"Going into 2024, it was our first opportunity as a company to showcase the size and grade potential of the Qavvik deposit. Our objective to drill at a shallower angle in order to intersect multiple lenses was highly successful both in terms of grade and size. The thick intersection in our first drill hole of several hundred metres of uranium mineralization is quite prolific. In addition, the high grades demonstrate tremendous potential for increasing the resource at Qavvik. We are very encouraged by these results and look forward to conducting more infill and expansion drilling at Qavvik.\" Story Continues QAVVIK DRILL PROGRAM - INFILL AND EXPANSION The Qavvik anomaly, hosts Forum's second deposit on the Aberdeen Project. The Aberdeen Project land package consists of approximately 95,000 ha or 950 square kilometres (365 square miles) of mineral claims in the Thelon Basin, located approximately 100 km west of Baker Lake. Qavvik is an 800mx800m gravity low 15 km west of the Tatiggaq deposit, which is adjacent to the 127 million pound Kiggavik project held by Orano/Denison/UEC*. The mineralization is hosted in steep-dipping structures as well as along flat-lying foliation planes within the host rock. The area has been tested by 28 historical holes by Cameco from 2009 to 2012. These holes were largely drilled on 25 to 50 m centres at an orientation of -85 degrees to the southeast. Another nine short holes drilled in the late 70's, early 80's by Marline Oil and Anaconda intersected alteration but no uranium. Forum completed two drill holes into the Qavvik anomaly in 2024 totaling 835 m (Table 1). The objective of QAV24-001 was to drill at a shallower angle in a more optimal direction to crosscut multiple lenses rather than the historical holes that drilled steeply along the mineralized lenses. The objective of QAV24-002 was to intersect and extend the main lower lense intersected in historical drilling. Both these tests were successful and will guide the expansion targeting in 2025. The structural setting of Qavvik is still being interpreted but the main controls on mineralization appear to be east-northeast subsidiary faults, and potentially a northeast fault that transects the area. The mineralization is open throughout the anomaly but in particular, to the northeast and southwest along these fertile east-northeast trending fault zones. QAV24-001 intersected mineralization over 296 m and the heart of this intercept includes over 0.12% U3O8 over 162.4 m from 170.0 to 332.4 m. Over 20 intercepts with greater than 1% U3O8 were identified in the drill hole and show the grade and size potential of this mineralized area. High-grade intercepts of 8.17% U3O8 over 0.5 m at 172.0 m, 7.92% U3O8 over 0.1 m at 292.3 m and 6.30% U3O8 over 0.2 m at 318.8 m are the highest grade intercepts intersected at Qavvik to date from all the historical drilling. Table 2 outlines the mineralized intercepts intersected in QAV24-001 and QAV24-002. Figure 2 is a plan map showing the 2024 drill holes and the gravity anomaly that is being tested. Figure 3 is a simplified cross section of QAV24-001 showing the extent of mineralization and the main geological units. Figure 4 is a core photograph of the high-grade lense intersected in QAV24-001.

This sampling program was used in the resampling program as well. The 2024 QA/QC program utilized control samples comprising certified reference materials (CRMs), duplicates, and blank samples. CRMs were used to monitor laboratory accuracy in the analysis of mineralized and non-mineralized samples, duplicate samples were used to monitor analytical precision and repeatability at the preparation and analytical stages, and blank samples were used to monitor for cross contamination during preparation and analytical stages. Control samples were inserted every 10 th sample, alternating between blank, duplicate, and uranium CRM. Duplicate samples alternated between field, coarse, and pulp duplicates. Three low grade uranium CRMs were alternated between: BL-4a (0.1248% U), DH-1a (0.2629% U), and BL-2a (0.426% U). A high-grade uranium CRM (BL-5; 7.09% U) was inserted into the sample sequence when counts exceeded 10,000 cps. Blanks and duplicates were inserted at a rate of 1-in-20 in non-mineralized holes. For mineralized holes, blanks, duplicates, and uranium CRMs were inserted at a rate of 1-in-30. In addition to Forum's QA/QC program, SRC Geoanalytical Laboratories (SRC) conducted an independent QA/QC program, and its laboratory repeats, non-radioactive laboratory standards (BSL18, BSM, BSH, DCB01), and radioactive lab standards (BL2A, BL4A, BL5, and SRCU02) were monitored and tracked by Forum staff. For the resampling program the original sample intervals were identified from markers that still were present on the core boxes and quarter split samples were obtained from the remaining half split core that remained in the core boxes. The core was weathered and broken down in places due to the strong clay content in much of the mineralized intervals but it did not appear that any core was missing and it was in otherwise good condition. ASSAYING AND ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES Composite, Spot, and Assay samples were shipped to the ISO/IEC 17025: 2005 accredited SRC Geoanalytical Laboratories in Saskatoon for sample preparation and analysis. Non-mineralized systematic and spot samples are dried, crushed, and pulverized for analysis by the ICP-MS Exploration Package for sandstone and basement (codes ICP-MS1 and ICP-MS2 respectively). This analytical package consists of three separate analyses of inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) on the partial and total digestions of an aliquot of sample pulp material. Partial digestion is completed via nitric and hydrochloric acids and total digestion is completed via hydrofluoric, nitric, and perchloric acids. The SRC implements several instrumental and analytical quality control procedures for this analytical package. Instrumental checks comprise two calibration checks and two calibration standards. Analytical quality control consists of one blank, two reference materials, and one pulp replicate (duplicate) in each group of 40 samples. Samples with radioactivity over 500 CPS and indicated as assay samples were analysed using the ICP-MS Exploration Package (ICP-MS), ICP-OES (ICP1), and U 3 O 8 Assay (U 3 O 8 wt% Assay). The sample preparation procedures for ICP-MS and ICP1 are the same, and the U 3 O 8 wt% assay uses an aliquot of sample pulp digested in hydrochloric and nitric acid followed by ICP-OES finish. This method is capable of detecting as low as 0.001 weight percent (wt%) U 3 O 8 . All Assay samples were also analysed for gold by fire assay using aqua regia with ICP-OES finish. Boron analysis was conducted on all sample types and is completed by fusing an aliquot of sample pulp in a mixture of Na 2 O 2 and NaCO 3 , followed by ICP-OES. The SRC inserts a blank, an in-house reference material, and a replicate sample with each batch for analytical quality control and uses a 1000 ppm B commercial certified solution for equipment calibration. DOWNHOLE RADIOMETRIC PROBING METHOD Of the 30 holes completed in 2024,18 were successfully radiometrically logged using a 2GHF-1000 Triple Gamma downhole probe sourced from Terraplus in Ontario, Canada. The probe measures natural gamma radiation every 10 cm along the length of the drill hole. The total count NaI, which reports in count per second, may not be directly or uniformly related to uranium grades and are only an indication of the presence of radioactive minerals. *Source: The Kiggavik deposit is held by Orano (66.2%), Denison (16.9%) and Uranium Energy Corp. (16.9%). Kiggavik mineral resources are 127.3 million pounds Indicated mineral resource grading 0.55% U3O8 and 5.4 million pounds Inferred mineral resource grading 0.33% U3O8 as reported on the Denison Mines Ltd.

Brown's sideline read skyrockets to No. 1 hottest seller on Amazon 1 / 4 Packers Eagles Football Philadelphia Eagle wide receiver A.J. Brown (11) looks on after talking with his son before an NFL wild-card playoff football game against the Green Bay Packers, Sunday, Jan. 12, 2025, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Chris Szagola) DAN GELSTON Updated Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 9:18 PM 3 min read PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 Step aside, Oprah . Philadelphia Eagles star receiver A.J. Brown could launch a book club of his own after a little sideline reading skyrocketed self-help author Jim Murphy to the hottest seller on Amazon overnight. The Eagles wide receiver passed on the playbook and checked out an inspirational title \u2014 Brown casually ignored the action in Philadelphia's playoff game and flipped through the pages of Murphy's book, \u201cInner Excellence.\u201d The little-known book by the mental skills coach was listed No. 1 on Amazon\u2019s best-sellers list as of Monday morning. \u201cI was not expecting that. A real gift,\u201d Murphy said by phone Monday. \u201cI just looked at Amazon last night and it got to No. 1, so that was a surprise. It had probably never been higher than probably 8 or 9,000. In the thousands, somewhere.\u201d Nine thousand? Keep going. Down. Way down. The book took the top spot on the trending list after previously being ranked 523,497th. That jump earned it another top spot on the marketplace\u2019s movers & shakers list . It had yet to crack the top 100 for sales in 2025, however. Mel Robbins , Rebecca Yarros , Kristin Hannah and the likes still reigned supreme there. Undoubtedly fueled by Eagles fans , \u201cInner Excellence\u201d was reviewed 375 times and rated 4.7 out of 5 on Amazon. For comparison, Freida McFadden's critically acclaimed book \u201cThe Housemaid\u201d had 431,491 reviews with a 4.5 rating yet was ranked nine spots behind it on the best-sellers list. \u201cAJ Brown recommended this book, so I\u2019m looking forward to reading this. Fly Eagles Fly,\u201d one reviewer wrote on the site. Murphy, a former minor league outfielder in the Chicago Cubs organization, told the AP in an interview Sunday night that his phone started blowing up with texts once his book was spotted. After his career ended, Murphy became intrigued by the idea of learning how to teach baseball players how to have confidence under pressure. \u201cI spent five years full-time writing and researching the answer to that question,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThat became the book \u2018Inner Excellence.\u2019\" Brown, who had 67 catches for 1,079 yards and seven touchdown this season, described the lessons in the book as useful because football is \u201c90% mental and 10% physical for me.\u201d Brown later shared a photo of the book on social media with several passages highlighted and underlined in yellow. Brown said he was surprised his moment went viral because he says he often reads on the sideline, but added: \u201cY\u2019all caught me that time.\u201d \u201cIf I score a touchdown or drop a pass, it\u2019s something how I refocus,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI always revert back to the beginning of the book. It states if you can just have a clear mind and remember that nothing else matters, clear conscience, nothing matters negative or positive. You\u2019re willing to take risks. It also says if you\u2019re humble, you can\u2019t be embarrassed.\u201d Story Continues It must have worked. The Eagles beat the Green Bay Packers and advanced in the NFL playoffs. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard Recommended Stories", "symbol":

Potential New Zone 300 Metres North of the Tatiggaq Deposit Newsfile Corp. Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 2:30 PM 11 min read In This Article: FDCFF -2.68% Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - January 13, 2025) - Forum Energy Metals Corp. (TSXV: FMC) (OTCQB: FDCFF) (\"Forum\" or the \"Company\") announces assay results from the remaining eight drill holes for the Tatiggaq anomaly completed as part of the 2024 exploration program on its 100% owned Aberdeen property in Nunavut, Canada. These drill holes were designed to test sub-parallel structures within the Tatiggaq gravity anomaly at significant step out intervals, demonstrating the large- scale potential of the project with the identification of a potential new zone 300 metres north of the Main Tatiggaq deposit. Drillhole TAT24-021 intersected 0.79% U3O8 over 0.1 m in a strong alteration zone with significant geochemical pathfinder elements at a depth of 221 metres. Rick Mazur, CEO said, \"Forum has the most advanced exploration property in the Thelon Basin right next door to an economically viable uranium deposit. This year's drill program successfully expanded the footprint of our two basement-hosted discoveries, Tatiggaq and Qavvik and initiated our search for large unconformity contact-type deposits with drilling at the Ned, Ayra and Loki targets. With continued drilling of our numerous blue sky target areas and further resource delineation on the Aberdeen Project, we believe that a generational uranium mining district is unfolding.\" Dr. Rebecca Hunter, Forum's VP, Exploration stated, \"The objectives we had for the 2024 drilling at Tatiggaq were to expand within the proximal footprint but also to step out at significant intervals to identify potential new uranium zones. With this last series of holes, we intersected uranium mineralization outside of the current Tatiggaq deposit area. While the uranium intercept is small, this is significant as results from the other holes in the series included elevated levels of uranium and boron, an important pathfinder element for uranium mineralization in the Thelon Basin. We are encouraged for the potential of the area to host more zones of uranium mineralization to build the scale of the Tatiggaq deposit given half of the anomaly remains untested.\" ABERDEEN PROJECT - THELON BASIN - NUNAVUT The Aberdeen Project consists of 950 square kilometres (2,460 square miles) of mineral claims in the Thelon Basin, located approximately 100 km west of Baker Lake, adjacent to the 127 million pound Kiggavik Project held by Orano/Denison/UEC*. The property was staked in 2021 by Forum and includes two preliminary discoveries: Tatiggaq and Qavvik which were made by Cameco, the previous operator. The previous operator drilled 135 holes totalling 36,100 metres, including 38 that were drilled into the Tatiggaq anomaly. Forum's 2024 exploration program consisted of 30 diamond drill holes covering 6,962 meters. Figure 1 shows the 2024 drill hole locations and the main east-northeast structures (Thelon and Judge Sissons faults) as well as the numerous, sub-parallel subsidiary faults. Story Continues TATIGGAQ PROGRAM - TESTING SUB-PARALLEL STRUCTURES Forum completed eight drill holes testing along the Tatiggaq Fault and subsidiary ENE-trending faults (A-F) to determine if there are additional mineralized zones or evidence of potential zones (Drill holes: TAT24-016 to TAT24-023). All eight drill holes intersected clay alteration and fault structures as well as elevated Boron, which is an important pathfinder element for uranium mineralization in the Thelon Basin. Maximum boron total digestion values of 967 ppm (TAT24-021), 792 ppm (TAT24-022), and 1,160 ppm (TAT24-023) were intersected. TAT24-021 also intersected elevated partial digestion values for Ag (23 ppm); As (151 ppm), Mo (4,200 ppm), and Zn (1,400 ppm), which are elements largely found very proximal to uranium mineralization in this area. Uranium mineralization was intersected in TAT24-021 and the intercept is as follows: TAT24-021 intersected 0.38% U3O8 over 0.3 m from 220.8 to 221.1 m including: 0.79% U3O8 over 0.1 m (221.0 - 221.1 m) TAT24-021 intersected strong clay alteration, as well as numerous fractures and breccias with abundant sooty sulphide and elevated radioactivity indicative of being potentially proximal to a mineralized zone. Elevated uranium was intersected in TAT24-017 (74 ppm); TAT24-019 (76 ppm); TAT24-020 (112 ppm) and TAT24-023 (87 ppm). These intersections coincided with increased fracturing, bleaching, sooty sulphide and clay alteration. TAT24-023 was attempting to follow-up on uranium mineralization intersected at TAT24-021 but was lost in strong clay alteration and will need to be retested. The northern part of the Tatiggaq anomaly has shown that it is highly anomalous in both uranium and boron and the entire northeast part of the anomaly was not tested in 2024. Future testing along of these fertile structures to the northeast, in particular the Tatiggaq Fault and the D Fault, could be prospective for additional zones. Figure 2 is a plan map showing the 2024 step out drill hole locations and the fault zones. TATIGGAQ 2024 DRILL PROGRAM SUMMARY Cameco drilled 38 holes on the Tatiggaq Main and West zones prior to Forum's acquisition of the project by staking in 2021. Forum's 2023 and 2024 drill programs were formulated to infill and extend areas within the inferred mineralization to commence development of a preliminary maiden resource. In total, Forum's 2024 Tatiggaq exploration program consisted of 19 drill holes of which 11 were focused on the Main and West deposits and were designed to expand, infill and understand the resource within the proximal footprint of the existing discoveries. Eight drillholes tested sub-parallel structures at significant step out intervals and successfully identified a potential new zone 300 metres north of the Tatiggaq Main and West deposits. Highlights of the program were: Tatiggaq Main - Another parallel lense of high-grade uranium was intersected extending the width to 35 metres and remains open to a greater thickness. Tatiggaq West - Drilling demonstrated lateral continuity and thickness to the west and remains open along strike and at depth. Tatiggaq North - A potential new zone 300 metres north of the Main Tatiggaq deposit with an intersection of 0.79% U3O8 over 0.1 m at 221 m depth. The northern part of the Tatiggaq anomaly has shown that it is highly anomalous in both uranium and boron. The entire northeast part of the anomaly is prospective along the fertile structures to the northeast, in particular the Tatiggaq Fault and the D Fault. Tatiggaq West Resampling - Forum resampled six historical uranium mineralized drill holes from the Tatiggaq West zone as these drill results were not filed publicly by the previous operator. These results now provide Forum with a complete mineralized assay database of the Tatiggaq West zone, and in concert with the public historical drill data and the drilling data from Forum's 2023 and 2024 exploration programs, form the foundation for the development of an in-house resource at Tatiggaq.

This sampling program was used in the resampling program as well. The 2024 QA/QC program utilized control samples comprising certified reference materials (CRMs), duplicates, and blank samples. CRMs were used to monitor laboratory accuracy in the analysis of mineralized and non-mineralized samples, duplicate samples were used to monitor analytical precision and repeatability at the preparation and analytical stages, and blank samples were used to monitor for cross contamination during preparation and analytical stages. Control samples were inserted every 10 th sample, alternating between blank, duplicate, and uranium CRM. Duplicate samples alternated between field, coarse, and pulp duplicates. Three low grade uranium CRMs were alternated between: BL-4a (0.1248% U), DH-1a (0.2629% U), and BL-2a (0.426% U). A high-grade uranium CRM (BL-5; 7.09% U) was inserted into the sample sequence when counts exceeded 10,000 cps. Blanks and duplicates were inserted at a rate of 1-in-20 in non-mineralized holes. For mineralized holes, blanks, duplicates, and uranium CRMs were inserted at a rate of 1-in-30. In addition to Forum's QA/QC program, SRC Geoanalytical Laboratories (SRC) conducted an independent QA/QC program, and its laboratory repeats, non-radioactive laboratory standards (BSL18, BSM, BSH, DCB01), and radioactive lab standards (BL2A, BL4A, BL5, and SRCU02) were monitored and tracked by Forum staff. For the resampling program the original sample intervals were identified from markers that still were present on the core boxes and quarter split samples were obtained from the remaining half split core that remained in the core boxes. The core was weathered and broken down in places due to the strong clay content in much of the mineralized intervals but it did not appear that any core was missing and it was in otherwise good condition. ASSAYING AND ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES Composite, Spot, and Assay samples were shipped to the ISO/IEC 17025: 2005 accredited SRC Geoanalytical Laboratories in Saskatoon for sample preparation and analysis. Non-mineralized systematic and spot samples are dried, crushed, and pulverized for analysis by the ICP-MS Exploration Package for sandstone and basement (codes ICP-MS1 and ICP-MS2 respectively). This analytical package consists of three separate analyses of inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) on the partial and total digestions of an aliquot of sample pulp material. Partial digestion is completed via nitric and hydrochloric acids and total digestion is completed via hydrofluoric, nitric, and perchloric acids. The SRC implements several instrumental and analytical quality control procedures for this analytical package. Instrumental checks comprise two calibration checks and two calibration standards. Analytical quality control consists of one blank, two reference materials, and one pulp replicate (duplicate) in each group of 40 samples. Samples with radioactivity over 500 CPS and indicated as assay samples were analysed using the ICP-MS Exploration Package (ICP-MS), ICP-OES (ICP1), and U 3 O 8 Assay (U 3 O 8 wt% Assay). The sample preparation procedures for ICP-MS and ICP1 are the same, and the U 3 O 8 wt% assay uses an aliquot of sample pulp digested in hydrochloric and nitric acid followed by ICP-OES finish. This method is capable of detecting as low as 0.001 weight percent (wt%) U 3 O 8 . All Assay samples were also analysed for gold by fire assay using aqua regia with ICP-OES finish. Boron analysis was conducted on all sample types and is completed by fusing an aliquot of sample pulp in a mixture of Na 2 O 2 and NaCO 3 , followed by ICP-OES. The SRC inserts a blank, an in-house reference material, and a replicate sample with each batch for analytical quality control and uses a 1000 ppm B commercial certified solution for equipment calibration. Downhole Radiometric Probing Method Of the 30 holes completed in 2024,18 were successfully radiometrically logged using a 2GHF-1000 Triple Gamma downhole probe sourced from Terraplus in Ontario, Canada. The probe measures natural gamma radiation every 10 cm along the length of the drill hole. The total count NaI, which reports in count per second, may not be directly or uniformly related to uranium grades and are only an indication of the presence of radioactive minerals. *Source: The Kiggavik deposit is held by Orano (66.2%), Denison (16.9%) and Uranium Energy Corp.

Market Predicting a Spike in Black Stone Minerals (BSM) Stock? Zacks Equity Research Mon, Dec 30, 2024, 4:40 PM 2 min read In This Article: BSM +1.31% Investors in Black Stone Minerals, L.P. BSM need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 17, 2025 $2.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. What is Implied Volatility? Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy. What do the Analysts Think? Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Black Stone Minerals shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Black Stone Minerals is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Energy and Pipeline - Master Limited Partnerships industry that ranks in the Bottom 10% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from earnings of 37 cents per share to 38 cents in that period. Given the way analysts feel about Black Stone Minerals right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected. Looking to Trade Options?

{"text": "ARAY Stock Falls Despite Positive Data of CyberKnife in Treating BSM Zacks Equity Research Thu, Dec 19, 2024, 5:19 PM 5 min read In This Article: ARAY -1.79% Accuray Incorporated ARAY recently revealed findings from an international multicenter analysis, showing that the CyberKnife System delivers effective and time-efficient treatment for brainstem metastases (\u201cBSM\u201d). The study highlights stereotactic radiosurgery (\u201cSRS\u201d) and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (\u201cFSRT\u201d) as achievers of long-term local control with a strong safety profile, even in sensitive brain regions. The brainstem is an integral part of the central nervous system and metastatic spread to this part of the brain is a potentially life-threatening situation. Since surgical resection is rarely an option, SRS and FSRT are both effective and safe treatment alternatives when thoroughly planned and executed. SRS administers a single high-dose treatment, while FSRT breaks the total dose into smaller portions spread over several days. Both approaches enable medical teams to deliver highly precise and targeted radiation, typically to small, specific areas in the brain. In the analysis, 136 patients, who were treated in one to five sessions, were reviewed with 69.4% receiving their treatment in just one session. Likely Trend of ARAY Stock Following the News Following the announcement, shares of the company moved south 6.3% to $1.79 on yesterday\u2019s closing. In the past six months, ARAY\u2019s shares have lost 36.8% against the industry\u2019s growth of 5.6%. The S&P 500 has gained 27.7% in the same time frame. However, positive study data for CyberKnife in treating BSM is a clear win for ARAY. It not only strengthens the product\u2019s value proposition but also aligns with broader trends in precision oncology and non-invasive therapies. Investors tend to reward companies that successfully address critical healthcare challenges. So this news could serve as a meaningful catalyst for the price growth of ARAY stock. Meanwhile, ARAY currently has a market capitalization of $192.1 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $468.6 million, which indicates 4.9% growth from fiscal 2024 reported number. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research More on the Study Data for ARAY\u2019s CyberKnifeSystem The study aimed to provide more evidence supporting the use of radiosurgery for treating BSM. Researchers conducted a retrospective study comparing the safety and effectiveness of single-session (SRS) and multi-session (FSRT) radiotherapy treatments with the CyberKnife System. Data from nine institutions, covering 136 patients with 144 BSM treated between 2005 and 2022, were analyzed. Of these, 100 BSM were treated with SRS, while 44 received FSRT. Story Continues The study found local BSM control rates of 82.9% at one year, 71.4% at two years and 61.2% at three years, demonstrating long-term control even for tumors in sensitive areas. Both SRS and FSRT were well-tolerated, with few treatment-related side effects reported. These findings highlight the safety and effectiveness of these advanced treatments in managing BSM. CyberKnife System expands treatment options for patients with brain tumors and neurological conditions. It offers highly precise and targeted radiation therapy, which can treat delicate areas in the brain without the need for a metal frame. This allows it to be suitable for a wider range of patients, including those with recurrent tumors or young patients who may not be able to undergo traditional treatments. Additionally, it can be used at different stages of treatment, from first-line therapy to palliative care, offering more flexible treatment options. Likely Benefits of the Positive Data for ARAY The positive study data showcasing CyberKnife System\u2019s effectiveness and safety in treating BSM positions ARAY as a leader in precision radiation therapy. By addressing a critical need in treating delicate brain areas with minimal side effects, the company reinforces its reputation for innovation and reliability in the healthcare market. This could drive increased adoption of the CyberKnife System among healthcare providers, particularly as the data highlights its capability to deliver effective treatment with sub-millimeter precision and fewer patient burdens, such as eliminating the need for a fixed head frame. This appeal is likely to expand the company\u2019s customer base, translating into higher revenues and market share. Additionally, the study's publication in a respected journal like the International Journal of Cancer enhances the credibility of the CyberKnife System. This positive attention may encourage more oncologists and neurologists to consider CyberKnife for first-line, adjuvant or palliative care. The flexibility of its application across various treatment stages further broadens the therapy\u2019s market potential. As awareness grows, ARAY could see increased orders from both new and existing clients, strengthening its financial performance and paving the way for long-term growth. Favorable Industry Prospects for ARAY Per a report\u00a0by Grand View Research, the global brain tumor diagnosis and therapeutics market size was valued at $3.11 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.1% from 2024 to 2030. The growing launches of brain tumor therapeutics products and the rise in cancer awareness for brain tumor medications drive the market over the forecast period.

https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/warby-parker-price-target-raised-to-23-from-17-at-morgan-stanley Accuray ( ARAY ) announced international retrospective multicenter analysis found that radiosurgery, or SRS, and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy, or FSRT, delivered with the CyberKnife System, can provide an effective and time-saving treatment option for brainstem metastases, or BSM. The nine institution study results, published in the International Journal of Cancer, \u201cunderscore the long-term benefits in local control and the robust safety profile despite the delicate location of the treated metastases.\u201d SRS and FSRT \u2013 also referred to as fractionated radiosurgery \u2013 are advanced forms of radiation therapy. SRS delivers a high dose of radiation in one session, while FSRT divides the total treatment dose into multiple, smaller doses given over several days. Both techniques provide medical care teams with the ability to deliver extremely precise, very targeted doses of radiotherapy, typically to small, specific areas within the body, usually in the brain. In the reported analysis, 136 patients who received treatment in one to five sessions were analyzed; 69.4 percent received radiotherapy in just one treatment dose.

Extremely Challenging Location to Treat PR Newswire Wed, Dec 18, 2024, 3:35 PM 6 min read In This Article: ARAY -1.79% Study Builds on Extensive Published Literature Highlighting the Benefits of the CyberKnife System in the Treatment of a Wide Range of Neurological Indications MADISON,\u00a0Wis. , Dec. 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Accuray Incorporated (NASDAQ: ARAY) announced\u00a0today an international retrospective multicenter analysis found that radiosurgery (SRS) and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT), delivered with the CyberKnife \u00ae System , can provide an effective and time-saving treatment option for brainstem metastases (BSM). The nine institution study results, published in the International Journal of Cancer , \"underscore the long-term benefits in local control and the robust safety profile despite the delicate location of the treated metastases 1 .\" Accuray Incorporated (PRNewsFoto/Accuray Incorporated) (PRNewsFoto/Accuray Incorporated) \"The brainstem is an integral part of the central nervous system, and metastatic spread to this part of the brain is a potentially life-threatening situation. Since surgical resection is rarely an option, stereotactic radiosurgery and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy are both effective and safe treatment options when thoroughly planned and executed. The available literature, along with our multicenter study, clearly underscores the central role of radiosurgery for affected patients,\" said Felix Ehret , M.D., Department of Radiation Oncology, Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin and European Radiosurgery Center Munich, Munich, Germany . SRS and FSRT \u2013 also referred to as fractionated radiosurgery \u2013 are advanced forms of radiation therapy. SRS delivers a high dose of radiation in one session, while FSRT divides the total treatment dose into multiple, smaller doses given over several days. Both techniques provide medical care teams with the ability to deliver extremely precise, very targeted doses of radiotherapy, typically to small, specific areas within the body, usually in the brain. In the reported analysis, 136 patients who received treatment in one to five sessions were analyzed; 69.4 percent received radiotherapy in just one treatment dose 1 . \"The brain's tissues and structures are incredibly delicate and are essential to everything from basic functions to the very essence of who we are as individuals. That's why we developed the CyberKnife System to deliver radiation with the utmost accuracy and precision, and why we remain committed to innovating for better clinical outcomes for people with brain tumors, lesions, and benign neurological conditions,\" said Seth Blacksburg, M.D., MBA, Chief Medical Officer at Accuray. CyberKnife System Expands Treatment Options for People with Brain Tumors and Neurological Conditions The CyberKnife System can be used to treat brain tumors and neurological conditions with sub-millimeter accuracy and precision in just one to five sessions over one to two weeks. With the CyberKnife System, patients aren't required to have a metal frame attached to their head to undergo treatment, enabling a wide range of people, including those with recurrent tumors and young patients who can't be treated with a fixed head frame, to benefit from a shorter overall course of care that may positively impact their quality of life. The CyberKnife System can also be used at various stages in the treatment journey \u2013 from first line to adjuvant therapy and palliation \u2013 reinforcing its benefits in daily practice. Story Continues About the Study The objective of this analysis was to provide further evidence for the use of radiosurgery in the treatment of patients with BSM. The retrospective evaluation compared the safety and efficacy results achieved by nine institutions delivering radiotherapy in single (SRS) and up to five sessions (FSRT) with the CyberKnife \u00ae System to available published literature on these techniques. The multicenter study assessed 136 patients with 144 BSM who received treatment from 2005 to 2022. One hundred BSM were treated with SRS, and the remaining 44 received FSRT. The results showed one-year, two-year, and three-year local BSM control rates were 82.9 percent, 71.4 percent, and 61.2 percent. This study helps to underscore the long-term benefits in local control despite the delicate position of the treated metastases. SRS and FSRT treatments were well tolerated and the incidence of treatment-related side effects was low.
