[{"text": "Fortress doses first subject in Phase II CMV vaccine trial Triplex is a cytomegalovirus vaccine \u00b7 Clinical Trials Arena GlobalData Tue, Jan 28, 2025, 3:21 PM 2 min read In This Article: FBIO +0.27% FBIOP +0.53% Fortress Biotech and its subsidiary Helocyte have announced the dosing of the first subject in a multi-centre Phase II trial of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine, Triplex, for individuals who are undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). This trial focuses on administering the vaccine to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched related stem cell donors, to minimise CMV events in subjects undergoing HSCT. Funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) grant, the trial is set to demonstrate the vaccine's safety and effectiveness. Triplex is expected to trigger a CMV-specific immune response in the donor, which is then transferred to the transplant recipient. The initial Phase II trial builds on the findings from the Phase I pilot study that explored Triplex's immunological response and safety. It is being carried out across three US transplant centres, including the Brigham & Women\u2019s Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Northside Medical Center in suburban Atlanta, and City of Hope in Duarte, California. In addition, a subsequent NCI-funded trial will assess the same vaccine concept in higher-risk transplant recipients who are only partially HLA-matched to their donors. This follows a preliminary study in this transplant population. Fortress Biotech chairman and CEO and Helocyte executive chairman Lindsay Rosenwald said: \u201cThis new vaccination paradigm carries the advantage of potentially conveying earlier and more robust CMV immunity to a stem cell transplant recipient, versus vaccinating an HSCT recipient after engraftment has occurred around four weeks following transplant. \u201cWe are very pleased that this trial is underway and believe that this novel treatment approach could play a significant role in the prevention and treatment of CMV in the future. Triplex is the subject of multiple ongoing, planned clinical trials in the transplant setting and for HIV-1.\u201d Developed originally by the US cancer research and treatment organisation City of Hope, and exclusively licensed to Helocyte, Triplex is a universal recombinant Modified Vaccinia Ankara viral vector vaccine. \"Fortress doses first subject in Phase II CMV vaccine trial\" was originally created and published by Clinical Trials Arena , a GlobalData owned brand.

Dosed in Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Triplex Vaccination in Stem Cell Donors to Reduce CMV Events in Recipients of HSCT Fortress Biotech, Inc. Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 4:30 PM 8 min read In This Article: FBIO +0.27% FBIOP +0.53% Fortress Biotech, Inc. Study is the first randomized, controlled trial examining a vaccine\u2019s effectiveness in controlling CMV in recipients of HSCT from vaccinated donors Encouraging pilot study results demonstrated the benefit of vaccinating donors with Triplex to convey protective CMV-specific T cell immunity to allogeneic HSCT recipients at risk for CMV reactivation MIAMI, Jan. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fortress Biotech, Inc. (Nasdaq: FBIO) (\u201cFortress\u201d), and its majority-owned subsidiary, Helocyte, Inc. (\u201cHelocyte\u201d), today announced that the first patient was dosed in a multicenter, placebo-controlled and randomized Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate Triplex, a cytomegalovirus (\u201cCMV\u201d) vaccine, when administered to human leukocyte antigen (\u201cHLA\u201d) matched related stem cell donors to reduce CMV events in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (\u201cHSCT\u201d). The Phase 2 clinical trial is funded by a grant from the National Cancer Institute (\u201cNCI\u201d). Triplex is anticipated to induce a CMV-specific immune response in the donor\u2019s body who then conveys that virus-specific immunity to the intended recipient of the stem cell transplant through the concept of adoptive immunity. Vaccination of donors with Triplex prior to stem cell harvest and transplant is believed to introduce virus-specific immunity sooner, and in turn, reduce CMV events in patients undergoing stem cell transplantation. The objective of the trial is to determine whether Triplex is safe and effective in reducing CMV events in recipients of HSCT from vaccinated donors. CMV reactivation is one of the most common and life-threatening complications following allogeneic HSCT. The virus reactivates in an estimated 60-70% of CMV-seropositive recipients of HSCT with primary CMV infection occurring in 20-30% of CMV-seronegative recipients of HSCT from CMV-seropositive donors. \u201cCMV frequently affects patients undergoing transplants, posing significant risks to their recovery and survival. In this Phase 2 clinical trial, we are testing a new treatment approach, offering promise for better CMV management in HSCT recipients. This approach transfers CMV immunity from donors to transplant recipients, thereby potentially reducing the need for antiviral medications that can delay reconstitution of virus-specific immunity,\u201d said Don J. Diamond, Ph.D., Professor, Hematology & Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope\u2019s Los Angeles campus and the grants\u2019 principal investigator. Dr. Diamond and his team developed Triplex in cooperation with the NCI \u201cNExT\u201d program. Dr. Diamond also serves as a paid consultant to Helocyte and holds equity in the company. Story Continues The initial Phase 2 clinical trial ( NCT03560752 ) builds upon Phase 1 pilot trial data that evaluated the potential safety and immunological response of Triplex presented at the 2023 Tandem Meetings: Transplantation & Cellular Therapy Meetings of ASTCT and CIBMTR and published in the American Journal of Hematology . The study is being conducted across three nationally recognized transplant centers in the United States (City of Hope in Duarte, California; Brigham & Women\u2019s Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston; and Northside Medical Center in suburban Atlanta). A second trial, also funded by the NCI award, will formally test the same concept and will include higher risk transplant recipients, who are only partially HLA-matched to their donors. A preliminary study of that transplant population was also recently completed ( NCT04060277 ) . Lindsay A. Rosenwald, M.D., Fortress\u2019 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Helocyte, Inc., said, \u201cThis new vaccination paradigm carries the advantage of potentially conveying earlier and more robust CMV immunity to a stem cell transplant recipient, versus vaccinating a HSCT recipient after engraftment has occurred around four weeks following transplant. We are very pleased that this trial is underway and believe that this novel treatment approach could play a significant role in the prevention and treatment of CMV in the future. Triplex is the subject of multiple ongoing, planned clinical trials in the transplant setting and for HIV-1.\u201d Triplex was originally developed by City of Hope, one of the largest and most advanced cancer research and treatment organizations in the United States, and exclusively licensed to Helocyte. About Triplex Triplex is a universal (non-HLA-restricted) recombinant Modified Vaccinia Ankara viral vector vaccine engineered to induce a robust and durable virus-specific T cell response to three immuno-dominant proteins [UL83 (pp65), UL123 (IE1), UL122 (IE2)] linked to CMV complications in the post-transplant setting. In completed Phase 1 (see NCT01941056 ) and Phase 2 (see NCT02506933 , NCT03383055 ) studies, Triplex was found to be well-tolerated and highly immunogenic. Triplex is currently the subject of multiple ongoing clinical trials, including: a Phase 2 evaluation for CMV control in recipients of liver transplant (see NCT06075745 ); a Phase 1/2 trial for CMV control in pediatric recipients of HSCT (see NCT03354728 ); a Phase 2 trial for safety and immunogenicity in adults living with HIV and CMV (see NCT05099965 ); a Phase 2 trial for CMV control in recipients of stem cell transplant in which the stem cell donor is vaccinated with Triplex (see NCT06059391 ) and a Phase 1 trial of Triplex in combination with a bi-specific CMV/CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (see NCT05432635 ). Triplex is also the subject of several planned studies, including a Phase 2 trial for CMV control in recipients of kidney transplants. Helocyte additionally entered into an option agreement with City of Hope for exclusive worldwide rights to a novel bispecific CMV/HIV CAR T cell therapy (optionally for use in combination with Triplex), which is currently the subject of a Phase 1 trial in adults living with HIV-1 (see NCT06252402 ). About Helocyte Helocyte is a clinical-stage company developing novel immunotherapies for the prevention and treatment of cancer and infectious diseases, including cytomegalovirus (\u201cCMV\u201d) and human immunodeficiency virus (\u201cHIV\u201d). The Centers for Disease Control estimate that 50 to 80 percent of Americans are living with CMV by the age of 40. While the virus is asymptomatic in healthy individuals, it can cause severe and life-threatening disease in those with weakened or uneducated immune systems. Patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell and solid organ transplantation are at particularly high risk of experiencing complications associated with CMV. According to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, there were approximately 9,000 allogeneic (unrelated and related) bone marrow and cord blood transplants performed in the United States in 2023. According to preliminary data from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, there were over 46,000 organ transplants performed in the United States in 2023, comprised primarily of kidney and liver transplant procedures. Helocyte\u2019s Triplex vaccine is engineered to induce a robust and durable virus-specific T cell response to control CMV in transplant recipients. While current antiviral therapies have reduced the rate of CMV disease-related mortality in transplant recipients, such treatments have been linked to increased toxicity, delayed immune reconstitution and late onset of CMV. The Helocyte vaccines may also educate the body\u2019s innate immune system to fight CMV. For more information, please visit www.helocyte.com . About Fortress Biotech Fortress Biotech, Inc.

Important Safety Information Indication: EMROSI\u2122 is indicated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) of rosacea in adults. Adverse Events: The most common adverse reaction reported by \u22651% of subjects treated with EMROSI and more frequently than in subjects receiving placebo was dyspepsia. Contraindications: EMROSI should not be taken by patients who have a history of hypersensitivity to any of the tetracyclines. Warnings/Precautions: Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. If DRESS syndrome is recognized, discontinue EMROSI immediately. Use during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, infancy and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth and reversible inhibition of bone growth. Discontinue EMROSI use if Antibiotic-Associated Colitis occurs. Discontinue EMROSI if liver injury is suspected. Patients experiencing light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo should be cautioned about driving vehicles or operating heavy machinery. Clinical manifestations include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss. Discontinue EMROSI immediately if symptoms occur. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. Discontinue EMROSI immediately if symptoms occur. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight while using EMROSI. Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. EMROSI may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity, sclerae and heart valves. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of EMROSI, use EMROSI only as indicated. If superinfection occurs, discontinue EMROSI and institute appropriate therapy. Perform periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

Mustang expects its common stock to begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on The Nasdaq Stock Market as of the commencement of trading on January 16, 2025. The reverse stock split was approved on June 27, 2024 by Mustang\u2019s Board of Directors and stockholders representing approximately 56% of the voting power of Mustang\u2019s outstanding capital stock, with the authorization to determine the final ratio having been granted to the Company\u2019s Board of Directors.

No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the reverse stock split, and stockholders who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share will receive a proportional cash payment.

Priority review granted for CUTX-101 with PDUFA target action date set for June 30, 2025 Cyprium is eligible to receive royalties and up to $129 million in aggregate development and sales milestones Cyprium also retains ownership over any Priority Review Voucher that may be issued at NDA approval MIAMI, Jan. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fortress Biotech, Inc. (Nasdaq: FBIO) (\u201cFortress\u201d) and its majority-owned subsidiary, Cyprium Therapeutics, Inc. (\u201cCyprium\u201d), today announced the acceptance for review of the New Drug Application (\u201cNDA\u201d) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) for CUTX-101 (Copper Histidinate) for the treatment of Menkes disease, a rare X-linked recessive pediatric disease caused by gene mutations of the copper transporter ATP7A . The NDA has been granted Priority Review and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of June 30, 2025. In December 2023, Sentynl Therapeutics, Inc. (\u201cSentynl\u201d), a U.S.-based biopharmaceutical company wholly-owned by Zydus Lifesciences, Ltd. (\u201cZydus Group\u201d), assumed full responsibility for the development and commercialization of CUTX-101 from Cyprium. The NDA submission was completed by Sentynl who will be responsible for commercialization upon approval. As described below, Cyprium is eligible to receive royalties and retains ownership of any Priority Review Voucher that may be issued. The CUTX-101 NDA submission is supported by positive topline clinical efficacy results for CUTX-101, demonstrating statistically significant improvement in overall survival for Menkes disease subjects who received early treatment with CUTX-101, with a nearly 80% reduction in the risk of death compared to an untreated historical control cohort. Median overall survival was 177.1 months for CUTX-101 early treatment cohort compared to 16.1 months for the untreated historical control cohort. CUTX-101 was previously granted FDA Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track, Rare Pediatric Disease and Orphan Drug Designations. Additionally, the European Medicines Agency previously granted Orphan Drug Designation for CUTX-101. \u201cWe are thrilled that the NDA for CUTX-101 for the treatment of Menkes disease was accepted for review by the FDA and look forward to working with our partner, Sentynl, and the FDA during its review period. CUTX-101 could be the first FDA-approved treatment for Menkes disease, making this submission an important milestone for our company and for the patients suffering from this rare, often fatal, pediatric disease,\u201d said Lindsay A. Rosenwald, M.D., Fortress\u2019 Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Cyprium\u2019s Chairman. \u201cOur late-stage portfolio continues to advance with two recent FDA approvals received in Q4 of 2024 for Emrosi\u2122 and Unloxcyt\u2122 and this acceptance and Priority Review for the CUTX-101 NDA. We look forward to the potential achievement of additional upcoming milestones across our extensive portfolio of commercial and clinical-stage assets.\u201d Story Continues \u201cMenkes disease presents a difficult journey for patients and their caregivers, as ATP7A mutations impact the transport of copper to a range of organs and systems, such as the lungs, brain and heart. With no known cure or current FDA-approved treatments, death typically occurs between 2 to 3 years of age,\u201d said Matt Heck, President & Chief Executive Officer of Sentynl. \u201cWe are eager for the FDA to review our application for CUTX-101, which has the potential to be the first FDA-approved therapy for this devastating condition.\u201d If the CUTX-101 NDA is approved, the product may be eligible for a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV), for which Cyprium would retain ownership, and which can be redeemed for a subsequent marketing application or sold or transferred to a third party. Cyprium is also eligible to receive royalties and up to $129 million in aggregate development and sales milestones from Sentynl. About CUTX-101 (Copper Histidinate) CUTX-101 is an investigational drug currently under NDA review by the FDA to treat patients with Menkes disease. CUTX-101 is a subcutaneous injectable formulation of copper histidinate manufactured under current good manufacturing practice (\u201ccGMP\u201d) that is intended to improve tolerability due to its physiological pH. In a Phase 1/2 clinical trial conducted by Stephen G. Kaler, M.D., M.P.H., at the National Institutes of Health (\u201cNIH\u201d), early treatment of patients with Menkes disease with CUTX-101 led to an improvement in neurodevelopmental outcomes and survival. CUTX-101 has been granted FDA Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track, Rare Pediatric Disease and FDA Orphan Drug Designations. Additionally, the European Medicines Agency granted Orphan Designation for CUTX-101. An expanded access protocol for patients with Menkes disease is ongoing at multiple U.S. medical centers. About Menkes Disease Menkes disease is a rare X-linked recessive pediatric disease caused by gene mutations of the copper transporter ATP7A . The minimum birth prevalence for Menkes disease is believed to be 1 in 34,810 live male births, and potentially as high as 1 in 8,664 live male births, based on recent genome-based ascertainment (Kaler SG, Ferreira CR, Yam LS. Estimated birth prevalence of Menkes disease and ATP7A -related disorders based on the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). Molecular Genetics and Metabolism Reports 2020 June 5;24:100602). The condition is characterized by distinctive clinical features, including sparse and depigmented hair (\u201ckinky hair\u201d), connective tissue problems, and severe neurological symptoms such as seizures, hypotonia, failure to thrive, and neurodevelopmental delays. Mortality is high in untreated Menkes disease, with many patients dying between 2-3 years of age. Milder versions of ATP7A mutations are associated with other conditions, including Occipital Horn Syndrome and ATP7A -related Distal Motor Neuropathy. Currently, there is no FDA-approved treatment for Menkes disease and its variants. About Cyprium Therapeutics Cyprium Therapeutics, Inc. (\u201cCyprium\u201d) is focused on the development of novel therapies for the treatment of Menkes disease and related copper metabolism disorders. In March 2017, Cyprium entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (\u201cNICHD\u201d), part of the NIH, to advance the clinical development of CUTX-101 (Copper Histidinate injection) for the treatment of Menkes disease. CUTX-101 is an investigational drug currently under NDA review by the FDA to treat patients with Menkes disease. In 2023, Cyprium completed the transfer of its proprietary rights and assigned its FDA documents pertaining to CUTX-101 to Sentynl Therapeutics, Inc. Cyprium and NICHD also have an ongoing worldwide, exclusive license agreement to develop and commercialize adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy, called AAV-ATP7A, to deliver working copies of the copper transporter that is defective in patients with Menkes disease, and to be used in combination with CUTX-101; AAV-ATP7A gene therapy is currently in pre-clinical development and has received FDA Orphan Drug Designation.

CUTX-101 copper histidinate with PDUFA target action date set for June 30, 2025 CUTX-101 has potential to be the first FDA-approved treatment for Menkes disease, a rare and fatal pediatric disease SOLANA BEACH, Calif. and AHMEDABAD, India and MIAMI , Jan. 6, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Sentynl Therapeutics, Inc. (\"Sentynl\"), a U.S.-based biopharmaceutical company wholly-owned by Zydus Lifesciences, Ltd. (\"Zydus Group\"), and Fortress Biotech, Inc. (Nasdaq: FBIO) (\"Fortress\") announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for filing and Priority review Sentynl's New Drug Application (NDA) for CUTX-101, the product candidate for the treatment of Menkes disease. Menkes disease is a rare X-linked recessive pediatric disease caused by gene mutations of the copper transporter ATP7A.\u00a0Recent estimates suggest a prevalence of 1 in 34,810\u00a0to as high as 1 in 8,664\u00a0live male births. Sentynl Therapeutics, Inc. (PRNewsfoto/Sentynl Therapeutics) Sentynl's NDA is supported by positive topline clinical efficacy results for CUTX-101, demonstrating statistically significant improvement in overall survival for Menkes disease subjects who received early treatment with CUTX-101, with a nearly 80% reduction in the risk of death compared to an untreated historical control cohort. Median overall survival was 177.1 months for CUTX-101 early treatment cohort compared to 16.1 months for the untreated historical control cohort. \"The NDA acceptance of CUTX-101 marks an important step towards our vision to transform lives and meaningfully impact patients, caregivers, and the rare disease community at large,\" said Punit Patel , President and CEO, Zydus Americas. \"We remain committed to providing access to path-breaking discoveries that can address unmet needs globally, as evident in the potential impact of CUTX-101 on Menkes disease patients and their families.\" \"Menkes disease presents\u00a0a difficult journey for patients and their caregivers, as ATP7A mutations impact the transport of copper to a range of organs and systems, such as the lungs, brain and heart. With no known cure or current FDA-approved treatments, death typically occurs between 2 to 3 years of age,\" said Matt Heck , President & Chief Executive Officer of Sentynl. \"We are eager for the FDA to review our application for CUTX-101, which has the potential to be the first FDA-approved therapy for this devastating condition.\" CUTX-101 was granted Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track, Rare Pediatric Disease and Orphan Drug Designations by the FDA and Orphan Designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the FDA set a six-month period with a target action date of June 30, 2025 . Story Continues In December 2023 , Sentynl assumed full responsibility for the development and commercialization of CUTX-101 from Cyprium Therapeutics (\"Cyprium\"), a Fortress subsidiary company focused on the development of novel therapies for the treatment of Menkes disease and related copper metabolism disorders. \"We congratulate Sentynl on the NDA acceptance for filing and review of CUTX-101, a program that Cyprium advanced and proudly supports,\" said Lindsay A. Rosenwald , M.D., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Fortress and Chairman of Cyprium. \"The drug has a demonstrated safety and efficacy profile for the treatment of Menkes disease and, if approved, CUTX-101 will fill a significant unmet need for children suffering from this rare, fatal pediatric disease.\" About CUTX-101 (Copper Histidinate) CUTX-101 is an investigational drug currently under NDA review with the U.S. FDA to treat patients with Menkes disease. CUTX-101 is a subcutaneous injectable formulation of copper histidinate manufactured under current good manufacturing practice (\"cGMP\") that is intended to improve tolerability due to its physiological pH. In a Phase 1/2 clinical trial conducted by Stephen G. Kaler , M.D., M.P.H., at the National Institutes of Health (\"NIH\"), early treatment of patients with Menkes disease with CUTX-101 led to an improvement in neurodevelopmental outcomes and survival. Cyprium previously reported positive topline clinical efficacy results for CUTX-101, demonstrating statistically significant improvement in overall survival for Menkes disease subjects who received early treatment (ET) with CUTX-101, compared to an untreated historical control cohort, with a nearly 80% reduction in the risk of death. Median overall survival (OS) was 177.1 months for CUTX- 101 ET cohort compared to 16.1 months for the untreated historical control cohort. CUTX-101 has been granted FDA Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track, Rare Pediatric Disease and FDA Orphan Drug Designations. Additionally, the European Medicines Agency granted Orphan Designation for CUTX-101. An expanded access protocol for patients with Menkes disease is ongoing at multiple U.S. medical centers. About Menkes Disease Menkes disease is a rare X-linked recessive pediatric disease caused by gene mutations of the copper transporter ATP7A. The minimum birth prevalence for Menkes disease is believed to be 1 in 34,810 live male births, and potentially as high as 1 in 8,664 live male births, based on recent genome-based ascertainment (Kaler SG, Ferreira CR, Yam LS. Estimated birth prevalence of Menkes disease and ATP7A-related disorders based on the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). Molecular Genetics and Metabolism Reports 2020 June 5 ;24:100602). The condition is characterized by distinctive clinical features, including sparse and depigmented hair (\"kinky hair\"), connective tissue problems, and severe neurological symptoms such as seizures, hypotonia, failure to thrive, and neurodevelopmental delays. Mortality is high in untreated Menkes disease, with many patients dying between 2-3 years of age. Milder versions of ATP7A mutations are associated with other conditions, including Occipital Horn Syndrome and ATP7A -related Distal Motor Neuropathy. Currently, there is no FDA-approved treatment for Menkes disease and its variants. About Sentynl Therapeutics Sentynl Therapeutics, Inc.

GlobalData Tue, Jan 7, 2025, 2:59 PM 2 min read In This Article: FBIO +0.27% The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for filing and priority review of the new drug application (NDA) for Sentynl Therapeutics' CUTX-101 (copper histidinate) for the treatment of Menkes disease. Sentynl announced the acceptance with Fortress Biotech, with the former taking over complete responsibility for the therapy\u2019s development and commercialisation from Fortress Biotech subsidiary Cyprium Therapeutics as of December 2023. The therapy may be eligible for a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher (PRV) if approved. Cyprium would retain ownership of this voucher, which could be used for a subsequent marketing application or sold or transferred to a third party. Additionally, Cyprium is positioned to obtain royalties and aggregate development and sales milestones of up to $129m from Sentynl. Fortress Biotech chairman, president and CEO and Cyprium Therapeutics chairman Lindsay Rosenwald said: \"We congratulate Sentynl on the NDA acceptance for filing and review of CUTX-101, a programme that Cyprium advanced and proudly supports. \"The drug has a demonstrated safety and efficacy profile for the treatment of Menkes disease and, if approved, CUTX-101 will fill a significant unmet need for children suffering from this rare, fatal paediatric disease.\" The NDA submission for the therapy is backed by positive topline clinical efficacy outcomes, which have shown a statistically \u2018significant improvement\u2019 in overall survival (OS) among patients when treated early with the therapy. According to the data, a nearly 80% decrease is observed in the mortality risk when compared to an untreated historical control group. CUTX-101 has received the FDA fast track, rare pediatric disease, orphan drug, and breakthrough designations. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also granted it orphan designation. The FDA, under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), has set a six-month review period with a target action date of 30 June this year. A rare genetic disorder affecting copper levels in the body, Menkes disease is caused by mutations in the ATPase Copper Transporting Alpha (ATP7A) gene. \"FDA accepts Sentynl\u2019s Menkes disease therapy NDA for priority review\" was originally created and published by Pharmaceutical Technology , a GlobalData owned brand.

Recent Corporate Highlights Fortress Biotech, Inc. Fri, Nov 15, 2024, 12:10 AM 14 min read In This Article: FBIO +0.27% FBIOP +0.53% Fortress Biotech, Inc. Emrosi approved by FDA on November 4 for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in adults Cosibelimab PDUFA goal date of December 28 for potential approval to treat metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma MIAMI, Nov. 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fortress Biotech, Inc. (Nasdaq: FBIO) (\u201cFortress\u201d), an innovative biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring and advancing assets to enhance long-term value for shareholders through product revenue, equity holdings and dividend and royalty revenue, today announced financial results and recent corporate highlights for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. Lindsay A. Rosenwald, M.D., Fortress\u2019 Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, \u201cWe are thrilled to have received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) approval for Emrosi\u2122, a potential best-in-class treatment for inflammatory lesions of rosacea in adults, which is a tremendous milestone for Fortress and our partner company, Journey Medical Corporation (\u201cJourney Medical\u201d). This marks the first FDA approval across the Fortress portfolio, and demonstrates our ability to successfully in-license a clinical stage program and develop it through commercialization. We could achieve up to two more U.S. FDA approvals in the next nine months, and our next anticipated PDUFA goal date is December 28, 2024, for cosibelimab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, for the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (\u201ccSCC\u201d). We have an exciting late-stage pipeline with many upcoming value creation opportunities, and we are focused on attaining our long-term strategy of building shareholder value, while bringing innovative treatment options to patients with unmet medical needs.\u201d Recent Corporate Highlights 1 : Regulatory Updates In November 2024, the FDA approved Emrosi (Minocycline Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, 40mg), also known as DFD-29.\u00a0Emrosi has the potential to be the new treatment paradigm for the millions of patients suffering from inflammatory lesions of rosacea. The treatment is expected to launch late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2025 by our partner company, Journey Medical (Nasdaq: DERM). In July 2024, the FDA accepted the Biologics License Application (\u201cBLA\u201d) resubmission for cosibelimab, our investigational anti-PD-L1 antibody, as a treatment for patients with metastatic or locally advanced cSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation and set a PDUFA goal date of December 28, 2024. Cosibelimab is currently in development at our partner company, Checkpoint Therapeutics (Nasdaq: CKPT) (\u201cCheckpoint\u201d). In December 2023, we completed the asset transfer of CUTX-101 (copper histidinate for Menkes disease) to Sentynl Therapeutics (\u201cSentynl\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of Zydus Lifesciences Ltd. Sentynl completed the rolling submission of the New Drug Application for CUTX-101 in the fourth quarter of 2024. Cyprium Therapeutics (\u201cCyprium\u201d), our subsidiary company that developed CUTX-101, will retain 100% ownership over any FDA priority review voucher that may be issued at NDA approval for CUTX-101. Story Continues Clinical Updates In October 2024, clinical data were presented at the 44th Fall Clinical Dermatology Conference assessing the dermal and systemic pharmacokinetics of Emrosi versus oral doxycycline 40 mg capsules (Oracea\u00ae) in healthy subjects. With its extended-release formulation, Emrosi provides higher dermal concentration than doxycycline from day 1 onward at a similar dose, expected to translate into a clinically meaningful impact for treating patients with rosacea, and as demonstrated in Emrosi\u2019s Phase 3 clinical trials. In September 2024, we presented longer-term data from our pivotal trial of cosibelimab in locally advanced and metastatic cSCC during the European Society for Medical Oncology (\u201cESMO\u201d) Congress 2024. The longer-term results for cosibelimab demonstrate a deepening of response over time, with higher objective response and complete response rates than initially observed at the primary analyses. Other Updates In July 2024, we announced a collaboration to explore the combined therapeutic potential of cosibelimab with GC Cell\u2019s Immuncell-LC, an innovative autologous Cytokine Induced Killer (\u201cCIK\u201d) T cell therapy composed of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer T cells. Also in July 2024, our majority owned and controlled subsidiary company, Urica Therapeutics (\u201cUrica\u201d), entered into an asset purchase agreement, royalty agreement and related agreements with Crystalys Therapeutics (\u201cCrystalys\u201d). Urica transferred rights to dotinurad, its URAT1 inhibitor product candidate in development for the treatment of gout, and related intellectual property, licenses and agreements to Crystalys. In return, Crystalys issued to Urica shares of its common stock equal to 35% of Crystalys\u2019 outstanding equity and granted Urica a securitized 3% royalty on future net sales of dotinurad. Commercial Product Updates Journey Medical\u2019s net product revenues for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $14.6 million, compared to net product revenues of $14.9 million for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024. General Corporate: In July 2024, Checkpoint raised $12 million in a registered direct offering priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules. In July 2024, Fortress\u2019 Board of Directors paused the payment of dividends on the Company\u2019s 9.375% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d) until further notice. The Company believes pausing the dividend is in the best interest of the Company and its stakeholders to maintain financial flexibility ahead of potentially significant inflection points. Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock accrue in accordance with their terms; the pausing of these dividends will defer approximately $0.7 million in cash dividend payments each month. The Board intends to revisit its decision regarding the monthly dividend regularly and will assess the profitability and cash flow of the Company to determine whether and when the suspension should be lifted. Also in July 2024, Fortress reduced its total debt by entering into a new loan agreement maturing in July 2027 with funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (\u201cOaktree\u201d), a leading global investment firm. The Company received an initial tranche of $35 million and is eligible to draw an additional $15 million with Oaktree\u2019s consent. In connection with the new loan agreement, the Company repaid its prior term loan with Oaktree of $50 million resulting in an outstanding debt reduction of approximately $15 million of debt excluding accrued interest and prepayment fees. In September 2024, Fortress raised $8 million in a registered direct offering and concurrent private placements. In October 2024, Mustang Bio raised $4 million in gross proceeds from the exercise of existing warrants. In November 2024, Checkpoint received $9.2 million in gross proceeds through the exercise of existing warrants. Financial Results: As of September 30, 2024, Fortress\u2019 consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled $58.9 million, compared to $76.2 million as of June 30, 2024, and compared to $80.9 million as of December 31, 2023, a decrease of $17.3 million during the quarter and a decrease of $22.0 million year-to-date. Fortress\u2019 consolidated cash and cash equivalents, totaling $58.9 million as of September 30, 2024, includes $25.6 million attributable to Fortress and the private subsidiaries, $2.6 million attributable to Avenue, $4.7 million attributable to Checkpoint, $3.5 million attributable to Mustang Bio and $22.5 million attributable to Journey Medical. Fortress\u2019 consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled $80.9 million as of December 31, 2023, which included $40.6 million attributable to Fortress and private subsidiaries, $1.8 million attributable to Avenue, $4.9 million attributable to Checkpoint, $6.2 million attributable to Mustang Bio and $27.4 million attributable to Journey Medical. Fortress\u2019 consolidated net revenue totaled $14.6 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, all of which was generated from our marketed dermatology products. This compares to consolidated revenue totaling $34.8 million for the third quarter of 2023, which included $15.3 million in revenue generated from our marketed dermatology products and an upfront license agreement payment of $19 million. Consolidated research and development expenses including license acquisitions totaled $9.4 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $20.3 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023. Consolidated selling, general and administrative costs were $22.0 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $21.7 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023. Consolidated net loss attributable to common stockholders was $(15.0) million, or $(0.76) per share, for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to net loss attributable to common stockholders of $(7.1) million, or $(0.94) per share for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023.

Announces FDA Approval of UNLOXCYT\u2122 (cosibelimab-ipdl) Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc Sat, Dec 14, 2024, 2:15 AM 13 min read In This Article: FBIO +0.27% FBIOP +0.53% CKPT +11.62% Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc UNLOXCYT is the first and only FDA-approved anti-PD-L1 treatment for advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma WALTHAM, Mass., Dec. 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc. (\u201cCheckpoint\u201d) (Nasdaq: CKPT), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) has approved UNLOXCYT\u2122\u00a0(cosibelimab-ipdl) for the treatment of adults with metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (\u201ccSCC\u201d) or locally advanced cSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation. UNLOXCYT is the first and only programmed death ligand-1 (\u201cPD-L1\u201d) blocking antibody to receive FDA marketing approval for this indication. The recommended commercial dosage of UNLOXCYT is 1,200 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every three weeks. \u201cToday\u2019s FDA approval of UNLOXCYT \u2013 the first marketing approval for our company \u2013 is a significant milestone both for Checkpoint and for patients with advanced cSCC,\u201d said James Oliviero, President and Chief Executive Officer of Checkpoint. \u201cThis approval marks Checkpoint\u2019s transformation to a commercial-stage company, with the opportunity to compete in a U.S. market estimated to exceed $1 billion annually, where we believe UNLOXCYT offers a differentiated treatment option versus available therapies by binding to PD-L1, rather than programmed death receptor-1 (\u201cPD-1\u201d), to release the inhibitory effects of PD-L1 on the anti-tumor immune response. Additionally, UNLOXCYT has demonstrated the ability to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (\u201cADCC\u201d), another potential differentiating feature of the drug compared to existing marketed therapies for patients with cSCC.\u201d \u201ccSCC is the second most common form of skin cancer, and those diagnosed with advanced disease that has recurred or metastasized face a poor prognosis. cSCC remains a disease with a significant need for more effective and tolerable treatment options, particularly for patients with concomitant hematological malignancies, solid organ transplant recipients, or a history of autoimmune disorders,\u201d stated Emily Ruiz, M.D., M.P.H., Academic Director of the Mohs and Dermatologic Surgery Center at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Director of the High-Risk Skin Cancer Clinic at Dana Farber Cancer Center, and Associate Professor of Dermatology at Harvard Medical School. \u201cUNLOXCYT is the first FDA-approved PD-L1\u2013blocking antibody to demonstrate clinically meaningful objective response rates with durable responses in advanced cSCC. With its dual mechanisms of action and compelling safety profile, this promising drug will provide U.S. oncologists with an important new immunotherapy option for the treatment of cSCC.\u201d Story Continues FDA approval for UNLOXCYT was granted based on clinically meaningful objective response rates and duration of response data, as assessed by an independent central review committee, from Study CK-301-101 (NCT03212404), a multicenter, multicohort, open-label study of UNLOXCYT in adults with advanced solid tumor cancers, including cSCC. \u201cWe are excited about the approval of UNLOXCYT and are currently developing a commercial launch plan. We want to thank the patients, physicians, nurses, and clinical coordinators for their support and participation in our clinical program, and the FDA for their collaboration throughout this process,\u201d concluded Mr. Oliviero. About Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (\u201ccSCC\u201d) is the second most common type of skin cancer in the United States, with an estimated annual incidence of approximately 1.8 million cases according to the Skin Cancer Foundation. Important risk factors for cSCC include chronic ultraviolet exposure and immunosuppressive conditions. While most cases are localized tumors amenable to curative resection, each year approximately 40,000 cases become advanced and an estimated 15,000 people in the United States die from this disease. In addition to being a life-threatening disease, cSCC causes significant functional morbidities and cosmetic deformities based on tumors commonly arising in the head and neck region and invading blood vessels, nerves and vital organs such as the eye or ear. The immune-suppressed population in particular represents a challenging target in the treatment of advanced cSCC, as patients present with a more aggressive disease and with a higher risk of developing immune-related toxicities from checkpoint inhibitor treatment. About UNLOXCYT\u2122 (cosibelimab-ipdl) UNLOXCYT is a human immunoglobulin G1 (\u201cIgG1\u201d) monoclonal antibody that binds PD-L1 and blocks the interaction between PD-L1 and its T cell receptors, PD-1 and B7.1. This interaction releases the inhibitory effects of PD-L1 on the anti-tumor immune response. UNLOXCYT has also been shown to induce ADCC. INDICATION and IMPORANT SAFETY INFORMATION INDICATION UNLOXCYT (cosibelimab-ipdl) is indicated for the treatment of adults with metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (\u201ccSCC\u201d) or locally advanced cSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions Immune-mediated adverse reactions listed herein may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which can be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, and occur at any time after starting a PD-1/PD-L1\u2013blocking antibody, including UNLOXCYT. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment, they can also manifest after discontinuation of PD-1/PD-L1\u2013blocking antibodies. Immune-mediated adverse reactions affecting more than one body system can occur simultaneously. Monitor closely for signs and symptoms of immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function tests at baseline and periodically during treatment. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue UNLOXCYT depending on the severity of the adverse reaction (see Dosage and Administration in Prescribing Information ). In general, if UNLOXCYT requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroids (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reaction is not controlled with corticosteroids. Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis UNLOXCYT can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. In patients treated with other PD-1/PD-L1\u2013blocking antibodies, the incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 1% (3/223, Grade 2) of patients receiving UNLOXCYT. Immune-Mediated Colitis UNLOXCYT can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea, abdominal pain, and lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has occurred in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis treated with PD-1/PD-L1\u2013blocking antibodies. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 0.4% (1/223, Grade 1) of patients receiving UNLOXCYT. Immune-Mediated Hepatitis UNLOXCYT can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies Adrenal Insufficiency UNLOXCYT can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment per institutional guidelines, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue UNLOXCYT depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.9% (2/223) of patients receiving UNLOXCYT, including Grade 2 in 0.4% (1/223) of patients. Hypophysitis UNLOXCYT can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field cuts. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue UNLOXCYT depending on severity. Thyroid Disorders UNLOXCYT can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement or medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue UNLOXCYT depending on severity. Hypothyroidism occurred in 10% (22/223) of patients receiving UNLOXCYT, including Grade 2 in 5% (10/223) of patients. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 5% (12/223) of patients receiving UNLOXCYT, including Grade 2 in 0.4% (1/223) of patients. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, Which Can Present with Diabetic Ketoacidosis UNLOXCYT can cause type 1 diabetes mellitus, which can present with diabetic ketoacidosis. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue UNLOXCYT depending on severity. Immune-Mediated Nephritis with Renal Dysfunction UNLOXCYT can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse Reactions UNLOXCYT can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), have occurred with PD-1/PD-L1\u2013blocking antibodies. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate non-bullous/exfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue UNLOXCYT depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 7% (15/223) of patients receiving UNLOXCYT, including Grade 3 in 0.9% (2/223) of patients and Grade 2 in 4% (9/223) of patients. Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in <1% of the 223 patients who received UNLOXCYT or were reported with the use of other PD-1/PD-L1\u2013blocking antibodies. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis. Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barre syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy. Ocular: Uveitis, iritis, other ocular inflammatory toxicities. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment to include blindness can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada\u2013like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss. Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, including increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis. Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis and associated sequelae including renal failure, arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica. Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism. Other (Hematologic/Immune): Autoimmune hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenia, solid organ transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection. Infusion-Related Reactions UNLOXCYT can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Infusion-related infusion reactions were reported in 11% (24/223) of patients, including Grade 2 in 5.8% (13/223) of patients receiving UNLOXCYT. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion or permanently discontinue UNLOXCYT based on severity of reaction. Consider premedication with an antipyretic and/or an antihistamine for patients who have had previous systemic reactions to infusions of therapeutic proteins. Complications of Allogeneic HSCT Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-1/PD-L1\u2013blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1\u2013blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, UNLOXCYT can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway can lead to increased risk of immune-mediated rejection of the developing fetus, resulting in fetal death. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with UNLOXCYT and for 4 months after the last dose. Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions (\u226510%) were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, rash, diarrhea, hypothyroidism, constipation, nausea, headache, pruritus, edema, localized infection, and urinary tract infection.

In addition to the risk factors identified from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially include the following: our ability to establish and maintain a commercial infrastructure or to partner or license UNLOXCYT to a third-party with a commercial infrastructure; our, or our partner or licensee\u2019s, ability to successfully launch, market and sell UNLOXCYT or future products, if approved; failure to obtain and maintain requisite regulatory approvals; the potential for variation from our projections and estimates about the potential market for UNLOXCYT; the risk that UNLOXCYT will not be commercially successful; our ability to meet post-approval compliance obligations (on topics including but not limited to product quality, product distribution and supply chain, pharmacovigilance, and sales and marketing); potential regulatory challenges to our plans to seek marketing approval for UNLOXCYT in additional geographies, outside of the U.S.; risks related to our chemistry, manufacturing and controls and contract manufacturing relationships; risks related to our ability to obtain, perform under and maintain financing and strategic agreements and relationships; risks related to our need for substantial additional funds; other uncertainties inherent in research and development; our dependence on third-party suppliers; government regulation; patent and intellectual property matters; competition; unfavorable market or other economic conditions; and our ability to achieve the milestones we project. Further discussion about these and other risks and uncertainties can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

inflammatory lesions of rosacea in adults; launch expected in late Q1 or early Q2 of 2025 Total revenues for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $14.6 million SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Nov. 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Journey Medical Corporation (Nasdaq: DERM) (\u201cJourney Medical\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, or \u201cour\u201d), a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company that primarily focuses on the selling and marketing of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d)-approved prescription pharmaceutical products for the treatment of dermatological conditions, today announced financial results and recent corporate highlights for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. Claude Maraoui, Journey Medical\u2019s Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, \u201cGiven the recent FDA approval of Emrosi\u2122, (Minocycline Hydrochloride Extended Release Capsules, 40 mg), formerly referred to as DFD-29, for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in adults, we are completing manufacturing activities and deploying our experienced dermatology sales force to quickly enable patient access to this unique therapeutic solution. This approval is a transformational milestone for both Journey Medical and the dermatology community, as Emrosi has the potential to become the best-in-class oral medication and standard of care to address inflammatory lesions of rosacea.\u201d Mr. Maraoui continued, \u201cWe also continued to commercialize our core dermatology products and experienced a solid third quarter of 2024, with $14.6 million in revenues. We look forward to continued growth with the anticipated launch of Emrosi in late first quarter or early second quarter of 2025.\u201d Financial Results: Total net product revenues were $14.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, a 4% decrease compared to the third quarter of 2023. Qbrexza net product sales increased by $1.7 million, or 29%, from the same period in 2023, due to our focused marketing efforts and the expansion of our access and coverage platforms for the product offset by decreases in sales volume for the remainder of our products. Cost of goods sold decreased by $1.1 million, or 18%, compared to the third quarter of 2023, driving a 6.0% increase in our gross product margin from 57.9% in the prior year quarter, to 63.9% for the third quarter of 2024. The gross margin increase was mainly due to inventory charges recorded in the prior year period and a decrease in product royalties from the same period in 2023. Research and development costs decreased by $1.4 million compared to the prior year quarter due to lower clinical trial expenses to develop Emrosi. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $2.8 million from the same period in 2023 mainly due to increases in non-cash share-based compensation expenses and overall selling and marketing expenses, including our pre-launch expenses for Emrosi. Net income for the third quarter of 2023 includes the one-time $19.0 million upfront payment received pursuant to our license agreement with Maruho Co., Ltd. Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $2.4 million, or $(0.12) per share basic and diluted, compared to net income of $16.8 million, or $0.91 per share basic and $0.80 per share diluted, for the third quarter of 2023. Our non-GAAP results in the table below reflect Adjusted EBITDA of $0.3 million, or $0.01 per share basic and diluted, for the third quarter of 2024 compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $20.8 million, or $1.13 per share basic and $0.99 per share diluted, for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2023 includes the one-time $19.0 million upfront payment received pursuant to our license agreement with Maruho Co., Ltd. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA per share basic and Adjusted EBITDA per share diluted are non-GAAP financial measures, each of which is reconciled to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP below under \u201c Use of Non-GAAP Measures .\u201d At September 30, 2024, the Company had $22.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, as compared to $23.9 million at June 30, 2024. Story Continues Recent Corporate Highlights: In November 2024, the U.S. FDA approved Emrosi (Minocycline Hydrochloride Extended Release Capsules, 40 mg) for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in adults. In October 2024, clinical data was presented at the 44th Fall Clinical Dermatology Conference assessing the dermal and systemic pharmacokinetics of Emrosi versus oral Doxycycline 40 mg capsules (Oracea \u00ae ) in healthy subjects. With its extended-release formulation, Emrosi provides higher dermal concentration than doxycycline from Day 1 onward at a similar dose, expected to translate into a clinically meaningful impact for treating patients with rosacea, and as demonstrated in Emrosi\u2019s Phase 3 clinical trials. In July 2024, Journey Medical appointed Michael C. Pearce to its Board of Directors. Mr. Pearce is an accomplished executive, with substantial strategic, business and financial experience across many industries, including healthcare.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) excluding interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization, less certain other non-cash and infrequent items not considered to be normal, recurring operating expenses, including, share-based compensation expense, amortization and impairments of acquired intangible assets, severance, short-term research and development expense and foreign exchange transaction losses. In particular, we exclude the following matters for the reasons more fully described below: Share-Based Compensation Expense : We exclude share-based compensation from our adjusted financial results because share-based compensation expense, which is non-cash, fluctuates from period to period based on factors that are not within our control, such as our stock price on the dates share-based grants are issued. Non-core and Short-term Research and Development Expense :\u00a0We exclude research and development costs incurred in connection with Emrosi, formerly referred to as DFD-29, including the filing fee payment made to the FDA and contractual milestone payments, which was the only product in our portfolio not approved for marketing and sale during the reporting period, because we do not consider such costs to be normal, recurring operating expenses that are core to our long-term strategy. Instead, our long-term strategy is focused on the marketing and sale of our core FDA-approved dermatological products and out licensing our intellectual property and related technologies. Amortization and impairments of Acquired Intangible Assets : We exclude the impact of certain amounts recorded in connection with the acquisitions of intangible assets that are either non-cash or not normal, recurring operating expenses due to their nature, variability of amounts, and lack of predictability as to occurrence and/or timing. These amounts may include non-cash items such as the amortization impairments of acquired intangible assets. Adjusted EBITDA per share basic and Adjusted EBITDA per share diluted are determined by dividing the resulting Adjusted EBITDA by the number of shares outstanding on an actual and fully diluted basis. Management believes the use of these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company\u2019s performance because (i) it allows for greater transparency with respect to key measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, (ii) it excludes the impact of non-cash or, when specified, non-recurring items that are not directly attributable to the Company\u2019s core operating performance and that may obscure trends in the Company\u2019s core operating performance and (iii) it is used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help analyze the Company's results. However, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA per share basic, Adjusted EBITDA per share diluted and any other non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Further, non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company and the manner in which they are calculated may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures or the calculations of the same non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, including the Company\u2019s competitors.

read In This Article: FBIO +0.27% FBIOP +0.53% CKPT +11.62% Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc Biologics License Application for cosibelimab under review by U.S. FDA PDUFA goal date of December 28, 2024 WALTHAM, Mass., Nov. 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc. (\u201cCheckpoint\u201d) (Nasdaq: CKPT), a clinical-stage immunotherapy and targeted oncology company, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and recent corporate updates. \u201cWith the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (\u201cPDUFA\u201d) goal date set for next month, we await the decision by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) on our Biologics License Application (\u201cBLA\u201d) resubmission for cosibelimab, our anti-programmed death ligand-1 (\u201cPD-L1\u201d) antibody,\u201d said James Oliviero, President and Chief Executive Officer of Checkpoint. \u201cThe $9.2 million in cash proceeds received this month from the exercise of existing warrants has strengthened our balance sheet to extend beyond our PDUFA date and into 2025. We are now fully focused on preparing for the potential approval of cosibelimab and look forward to potentially offering oncologists a new, differentiated treatment option for patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (\u201ccSCC\u201d).\u201d Recent Corporate Updates: In July 2024, Checkpoint announced that the FDA accepted for review the resubmission of its BLA for cosibelimab as a complete response to the complete response letter (\u201cCRL\u201d) issued in December 2023 and set a PDUFA goal date of December 28, 2024. Also in July 2024, Checkpoint announced a collaboration to explore the combined therapeutic potential of cosibelimab, its anti-PD-L1 antibody with dual mechanism of action, with GC Cell\u2019s Immuncell-LC, an innovative autologous Cytokine Induced Killer T cell therapy composed of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer T cells. Also in July 2024, Checkpoint completed a registered direct offering priced At-the-Market under Nasdaq rules and a concurrent private placement of warrants to purchase Checkpoint common stock, for total gross proceeds of approximately $12.0 million. In September 2024, Checkpoint presented longer-term data from its pivotal trial of cosibelimab in locally advanced and metastatic cSCC during the European Society for Medical Oncology (\u201cESMO\u201d) Congress 2024. Longer-term results for cosibelimab presented at the ESMO Congress demonstrate a deepening of response over time, with higher objective response and complete response rates than initially observed at the primary analyses. A copy of the ESMO poster can be found on the Publications page of Checkpoint\u2019s website. In November 2024, Checkpoint received $9.2 million in cash proceeds through the exercise of existing warrants. Story Continues Financial Results: Cash Position : As of September 30, 2024, Checkpoint\u2019s cash and cash equivalents totaled $4.7 million, compared to $5.0 million at June 30, 2024 and $4.9 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $0.3 million for the quarter and a decrease of $0.2 million, year-to-date. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, in November 2024, Checkpoint received $9.2 million in cash proceeds through the exercise of existing warrants. R&D Expenses : Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $6.4 million, compared to $5.5 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $0.9 million.

Net Loss : Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the third quarter of 2024 was $9.7 million, or $0.23 per share, compared to a net loss of $5.7 million, or $0.29 per share, in the third quarter of 2023.

Forward\u2010Looking Statements This press release contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended, that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our resubmission of our BLA for cosibelimab and review thereof, our belief that the BLA resubmission potentially addresses all the issues in the CRL, our belief about the comprehensive nature of our BLA resubmission and reaching alignment with the FDA on our cosibelimab BLA resubmission strategy, our ability to work with our third-party contract manufacturing organization (\u201cCMO\u201d) and the FDA to adequately address the issues raised in the CRL and execute on a pathway forward for the potential marketing approval of cosibelimab, the adequacy of the responses to the inspection issues submitted to FDA by our third-party CMO, our projections of regulatory review timelines, the commercial potential of cosibelimab, if approved, and the potential differentiation of cosibelimab, including a potentially favorable safety profile as compared to the currently available anti-programmed death receptor-1 therapies and the dual mechanism of action of cosibelimab translating into potential enhanced efficacy. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially include the following: the risks and uncertainties associated with the regulatory review process; uncertainties regarding the timeline of FDA review of the resubmitted BLA; any inability to successfully work with the FDA to find a satisfactory solution to address any concerns in a timely manner or at all during the review process for the BLA, including any inability to provide the FDA with data, analysis or other information sufficient to support an approval of the BLA; our, and our third party CMO\u2019s, ability to adequately address the issues raised in the CRL; issues associated with any facility inspection or re-inspection of our third party CMO or otherwise during the review process for the BLA; the risk that our third-party CMO will not meet deadlines, and/or comply with applicable regulations; whether the FDA accepts the data and results as included in the BLA resubmission at levels consistent with the published results, or at all; our ability to execute a partnering or other relationship to enable the commercialization of cosibelimab, if approved, on acceptable terms, if at all; the risk that topline and interim data remains subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the topline or interim data we previously published; the risk that safety issues or trends will be observed in the clinical trial when the full safety dataset is available and analyzed; the risk that a positive primary endpoint does not translate to all, or any, secondary endpoints being met; risks that regulatory authorities will not accept an application for approval of cosibelimab based on data from the Phase 1 clinical trial; the risk that the clinical results from the Phase 1 clinical trial will not support regulatory approval of cosibelimab to treat cSCC or, if approved, that cosibelimab will not be commercially successful; risks related to our chemistry, manufacturing and controls and contract manufacturing relationships; risks related to our ability to obtain, perform under and maintain financing and strategic agreements and relationships; risks related to our need for substantial additional funds; other uncertainties inherent in research and development; our dependence on third-party suppliers; government regulation; patent and intellectual property matters; competition; unfavorable market or other economic conditions; and our ability to achieve the milestones we project, including the risk that the evolving and unpredictable Russia/Ukraine conflict and COVID-19 pandemic delay achievement of those milestones. Further discussion about these and other risks and uncertainties can be found in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024, and in our subsequent other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Quarter 2024 Financial Results and Recent Corporate Highlights Avenue Therapeutics Fri, Nov 15, 2024, 12:05 AM 10 min read In This Article: ATXI -5.15% FBIO +0.27% FBIOP +0.53% Avenue Therapeutics - Topline data in Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of AJ201 for spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy anticipated around year-end 2024 MIAMI, Nov. 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Avenue Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATXI) (\u201cAvenue\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapies for the treatment of neurologic diseases, today reported financial results and recent corporate highlights for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \u201cWe have generated considerable momentum this past quarter in advancing our pipeline of innovative treatments for neurologic diseases,\u201d said Alexandra MacLean, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Avenue. \u201cAJ201 is a potential best-in-class asset that would bring a disease-modifying therapeutic option to patients with significant unmet medical need in Kennedy\u2019s Disease. Since dosing the last patient in the study in May, we continue to work diligently to move the study forward. We are looking forward to sharing topline clinical data in the coming months and building upon our progress of delivering impactful therapies to patients suffering from neurologic diseases.\u201d Recent Corporate Highlights: AJ201 (Nrf1 and Nrf2 activator, androgen receptor degradation enhancer for SBMA) In May 2024, Avenue announced the last patient visit was complete in the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of AJ201 for the treatment of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), marking the final clinical milestone ahead of the anticipated topline data announcement around year-end 2024. The 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of AJ201 enrolled 25 patients randomly assigned to AJ201 (600 mg/day) or placebo. The primary endpoint of the study is to assess safety and tolerability of AJ201 in subjects with clinically and genetically defined SBMA. Secondary endpoints include pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data measuring change from baseline in mutant AR protein levels in skeletal muscle and changes from baseline in expression of Nrf2-activated genes in skeletal muscle. Exploratory objectives of the study include changes in the fat and muscle composition as seen on MRI scans. These endpoints are believed to be biomarkers indicating likelihood for longer term clinical improvement. Further details about this study can be found at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT05517603). BAER-101 (GABA A \u03b12/3 positive allosteric modulator) Subject to the receipt of additional financing, Avenue plans to initiate a Phase 2a clinical trial of BAER-101 in patients with focal epilepsy and other seizure disorders. Preclinical mouse models have demonstrated BAER-101 as a therapeutic option with the ability to fully suppress seizure activity, with the effect being fast in onset and stable throughout the duration of testing. Story Continues IV Tramadol Avenue has reached final agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) on the safety study protocol and statistical analysis approach for the Phase 3 study of intravenous (\u201cIV\u201d) tramadol, which is being developed for the treatment of acute post-operative pain in a medically supervised setting. The proposed study will randomize approximately 300 post bunionectomy patients to IV tramadol or IV morphine for pain relief administered during a 48-hour post-operative period. Patients will have access to IV hydromorphone, a Schedule II opioid, for rescue of breakthrough pain. Avenue aims to initiate the Phase 3 safety study pending additional financing or a partnership. The Company believes that the study can be completed and submitted to the FDA within 12 months of the study\u2019s initiation. Financial Results: Cash Position: As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.6 million, compared to $4.9 million at June 30, 2024 and $1.8 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $2.3 million compared to the prior quarter and an increase of $0.8 million year-to-date. R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $2.3 million, compared to $0.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $0.8 million, compared to $1.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. Net Loss: Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the third quarter of 2024 was $(3.1) million, or $(1.92) per share, compared to net income of $0.5 million, or $4.86 per share, for the third quarter of 2023.

Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 4:30 PM 7 min read In This Article: MBIO -7.41% FBIO +0.27% FBIOP +0.53% Mustang Bio, Inc. MB-108 (HSV-1 oncolytic virus) is active and well tolerated in patients with recurrent glioblastoma in ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial Preclinical data support a novel combination of MB-108 (HSV-1 oncolytic virus) and MB-101 (IL13R\u03b12\u2010targeted CAR-T cell therapy) to optimize clinical results WORCESTER, Mass., Nov. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mustang Bio, Inc. (\u201cMustang\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (Nasdaq: MBIO), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on translating today\u2019s medical breakthroughs in cell therapies into potential cures for difficult-to-treat cancers, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) has granted Orphan Drug Designation to Mustang for MB-108, a herpes simplex virus type 1 (\u201cHSV-1\u201d) oncolytic virus, for the treatment of malignant glioma. The FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation to drugs and biologics that are intended for safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. Orphan Drug Designation provides certain incentives, such as tax credits toward the cost of clinical trials upon approval and prescription drug user fee waivers. If a product receives Orphan Drug Status from the FDA, that product is entitled to seven years of market exclusivity for the disease in which it has Orphan Drug designation, which is independent from intellectual property protection. Manuel Litchman, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Mustang, said, \u201cThe Orphan Drug Designation for MB-108 is significant for Mustang, as it could provide additional market exclusivity and we hope to advance MB-108, in combination with MB-101, as a potential treatment option for patients living with malignant glioma, including patients with recurrent glioblastoma (\u201cGBM\u201d) and high-grade astrocytomas, where there is historically a median overall survival of six months. Our novel therapeutic strategy, combining our MB-108 oncolytic virus with MB-101 CAR-T cell therapy, could be the first-ever industry-sponsored trial of its kind for the treatment of malignant glioma. As such, Mustang plans to also request Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for MB-101 (IL13R\u03b12\u2010targeted CAR-T cell therapy) in malignant gliomas. These advancements highlight our dedication to potentially improving outcomes for patients battling difficult-to-treat cancers.\u201d As previously reported, preclinical data presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (\u201cAACR\u201d) Annual Meeting in 2022 supported a combination therapy to potentially optimize results to treat recurrent GBM. The combination leverages MB-108 to reshape the tumor microenvironment (\u201cTME\u201d) and make cold tumors \u201chot,\u201d thereby potentially improving the efficacy of MB-101 CAR-T cell therapy. Data presented separately on MB-101 and MB-108 showed that administration of these therapies was well tolerated in recurrent GBM patients. Two patients treated solely with MB-101 who had high levels of intratumoral CD3+ T cells pre-therapy (i.e., \u201chot\u201d tumors) achieved complete responses lasting 7.5 and 31+ months, respectively. Importantly, of the 53 City of Hope Phase 1 patients disclosed at AACR in 2022, these 2 complete responses were observed in the 2 patients with the \u201chottest\u201d tumors prior to treatment with MB-101. Phase 1 clinical trials of MB-101 at City of Hope and of MB-108 at The University of Alabama at Birmingham continue to enroll patients. Story Continues The Company\u2019s ability to further develop the MB-109 program for recurrent GBM and high-grade astrocytomas is contingent upon raising additional funding and / or consummating a strategic partnership. About MB-109 (MB-101\u00a0(IL13R\u03b12 targeted CAR-T cells)\u00a0+ MB-108 oncolytic virus) MB-109 is Mustang\u2019s designation for the treatment regimen combining MB-101 (IL13R\u03b12\u2010targeted CAR-T cell therapy licensed from City of Hope) with MB-108 (HSV-1 oncolytic virus licensed from Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital). The combination is designed to leverage MB-108 to make cold tumors \u201chot\u201d and potentially improve the efficacy of MB-101 CAR-T cell therapy. MB-108 oncolytic virus is first injected to infect tumor cells which, in turn, leads to reshaping of the TME through recruitment of endogenous CD8- and CD3-positive effector T-cells. This inflamed TME potentially permits MB-101 CAR-T cells injected into and around the tumor to better infiltrate into and throughout the tumor mass, undergo activation and, ideally, effect tumor cell killing.
