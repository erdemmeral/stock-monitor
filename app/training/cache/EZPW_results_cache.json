(EZPW): Analysts Recommend This 52-Week High Stocks Now Neha Gupta Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 9:44 PM 5 min read In This Article: EZPW -0.67% We recently compiled a list of the 14 Best 52-Week High Stocks To Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where EZCORP, Inc. (NASDAQ:EZPW) stands against the other stocks. After two years of substantial gains to record highs, exhaustion in the US equity markets is slowly kicking in. Pullbacks in various sectors have come into play amid growing concerns about overstretched valuations. Likewise, the pullbacks have come on bond yields surging to levels not seen in two months, triggering a selloff in growth-oriented stocks. The 10-year yield touching highs of 4.79% has once again triggered demand for bonds at the expense of stocks, given the yields on offer. Additionally, the surge in bond yields comes on stronger-than-expected jobs reports that cast doubt on further interest rate cuts. The stock market rallied to record highs last year amid expectations that the Fed will embark on an aggressive easing push that involves interest rate cuts. A spike in inflation levels amid a resilient US job market has once again averted the prospects of the Fed aggressively cutting interest rates. Consequently, the global rise in bond yields around the globe is being driven by expectations of fewer than expected interest rate cuts.

The sentiments echo serious concerns about stocks trading at 52-week highs after blockbuster moves last year. Given that valuations at 52-week highs often appear overstretched, there are growing concerns that some of the stocks could be the subject of significant pullbacks. Amid the concerns, Turnquist does not see the prospect of the market edging into bear territory even though the market appears to be in a correction phase. Analysts at Goldman Sachs are also bullish about the equity market's outlook and believe there is not enough reason to back away from investing. Additionally, the analysts don\u2019t expect 2025 to be a problematic year for equity investments. \u201cValuations are not a good timing signal. ... There\u2019s no clear relationship between your starting valuation and the returns one year later,\u201d Brett Nelson, head of tactical asset allocation for the group, said Story Continues Goldman Sachs analysts expect the US economy to grow faster than Europe in 2025. A resilient US economy amid high interest rates should fuel stellar financial results characterized by revenue and earnings growth. \u201cWe do think that the earnings advantage that the U.S. has will continue,\u201d said Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, chief investment officer for the Goldman unit. The prospect of the US economy staying clear of recession even with the Fed leaving interest rates at current levels should offer much-needed support to stocks trading at all-time highs. Analysts also expect friendly regulations and deregulation from the upcoming Republican administration to act as a tailwind to fuel further gains in the equity markets.

Zacks Equity Research Mon, Jan 6, 2025, 5:40 PM 2 min read In This Article: EZPW -0.67% While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks, we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies. With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies. Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large. On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the \"Value\" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and \"A\" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today. EZCORP (EZPW) is a stock many investors are watching right now. EZPW is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. We should also highlight that EZPW has a P/B ratio of 0.82. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 1.02. Within the past 52 weeks, EZPW's P/B has been as high as 0.87 and as low as 0.60, with a median of 0.75. Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. EZPW has a P/S ratio of 0.57. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.32. Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that EZCORP is likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, EZPW sticks out at as one of the market's strongest value stocks. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why Zacks Equity Research Fri, Dec 20, 2024, 8:45 PM 3 min read In This Article: EZPW -0.67% Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task. In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end. However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects. Ezcorp (EZPW) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank. Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better. While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this consumer financial services company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below: Earnings Growth Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration. While the historical EPS growth rate for Ezcorp is 23.1%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 12.5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 4.7%. Cash Flow Growth While cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds. Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Ezcorp is 15.4%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -8.2%. While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 3.8% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 0.2%.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $270.48 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.

{"text": "Does Ezcorp (EZPW) Have the Potential to Rally 26.54% as Wall Street Analysts Expect? Zacks Equity Research Fri, Dec 6, 2024, 5:55 PM 4 min read In This Article: EZPW -0.67% Shares of Ezcorp (EZPW) have gained 6.9% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $12.51, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $15.83 indicates a potential upside of 26.5%. The mean estimate comprises three short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $2.84. While the lowest estimate of $13.50 indicates a 7.9% increase from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 51.9% to reach $19. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts. While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in EZPW. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside. Here's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price Targets According to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading. While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why? They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts. However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces. Story Continues That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism. Why EZPW Could Witness a Solid Upside Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. For the current year, one estimate has moved higher over the last 30 days compared to no negative revision. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 2.4%. Moreover, EZPW currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term.

{"text": "Tap These 5 Bargain Stocks With Impressive EV-to-EBITDA Ratio Anindya Barman Fri, Dec 20, 2024, 3:31 PM 6 min read In This Article: AGR 0.00% EZPW -0.67% AAT -0.66% ADT -0.13% Price-to-earnings (P/E), given its inherent simplicity, is the most commonly used metric in the value-investing world. It is preferred by many investors while handpicking stocks trading at a bargain. However, even this straightforward, broadly used valuation metric has a few downsides. Although P/E enjoys great popularity among value investors, a less-used and more complicated metric called EV-to-EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better alternative. EV-to-EBITDA gives the true picture of a company\u2019s valuation and earnings potential. It has a more comprehensive approach to valuation. ADT Inc. ADT, EZCORP, Inc. EZPW, OppFi Inc. OPFI, American Assets Trust, Inc. AAT and Avangrid, Inc. AGR are some stocks with attractive EV-to-EBITDA ratios. Here\u2019s Why EV-to-EBITDA is a Better Option Also referred to as enterprise multiple, EV-to-EBITDA is the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company\u2019s market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents. In essence, it is the entire value of a company. EBITDA, the other element, gives a clearer picture of a company\u2019s profitability by removing the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dampen net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy to cash flows. Typically, the lower the EV-to-EBITDA ratio, the more enticing it is. A low EV-to-EBITDA ratio could indicate that a stock is undervalued. Unlike the P/E ratio, EV-to-EBITDA takes debt on a company\u2019s balance sheet into account. For this reason, it is typically used to value acquisition targets. The ratio shows the amount of debt that the acquirer has to bear. Stocks flaunting a low EV-to-EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates. P/E can\u2019t be used to value a loss-making firm. A firm\u2019s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. In contrast, EV-to-EBITDA is harder to manipulate and can be used to value companies that have negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA front. EV-to-EBITDA is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. It can also be used to compare companies with different levels of debt. EV-to-EBITDA is not devoid of limitations and alone cannot conclusively determine a stock\u2019s inherent potential and future performance. The multiple varies across industries and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries, given their diverse capital expenditure requirements. Thus, instead of just relying on EV-to-EBITDA, you can club it with the other major ratios, such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to achieve the desired results. Story Continues Screening Criteria Here are the parameters to screen for bargain stocks: EV-to-EBITDA 12 Months-Most Recent less than X-Industry Median: A lower EV-to-EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation. P/E using (F1) less than X-Industry Median: This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers. P/B less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued. P/S less than X-Industry Median: The lower the P/S ratio, the more attractive the stock is, as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company. Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median. Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily. Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of $5 or higher.

Zacks Equity Research Fri, Dec 20, 2024, 5:40 PM 2 min read In This Article: EZPW -0.67% Here at Zacks, we focus on our proven ranking system, which places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, to find winning stocks. But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers. Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels. Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's \"Value\" category. Stocks with both \"A\" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now. One company to watch right now is EZCORP (EZPW) . EZPW is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. Another notable valuation metric for EZPW is its P/B ratio of 0.79. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 0.99. Over the past year, EZPW's P/B has been as high as 0.87 and as low as 0.60, with a median of 0.74. Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales.

Zacks Equity Research Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 5:55 PM 4 min read In This Article: EZPW -0.67% Ezcorp (EZPW) closed the last trading session at $11.92, gaining 2.8% over the past four weeks, but there could be plenty of upside left in the stock if short-term price targets set by Wall Street analysts are any guide. The mean price target of $15.67 indicates a 31.5% upside potential. The average comprises three short-term price targets ranging from a low of $13 to a high of $19, with a standard deviation of $3.06. While the lowest estimate indicates an increase of 9.1% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 59.4% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts. While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice. However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in EZPW. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside. Here's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price Targets According to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading. While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why? They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts. However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces. Story Continues That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism. Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in EZPW Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. For the current year, one estimate has moved higher over the last 30 days compared to no negative revision. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 1.6%. Moreover, EZPW currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term.

Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock. That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss. However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks. Ezcorp (EZPW) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank. Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better. Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this consumer financial services company a great growth pick right now. Earnings Growth Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration. While the historical EPS growth rate for Ezcorp is 23.1%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 11.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 4.6%. Cash Flow Growth While cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds. Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Ezcorp is 15.4%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -8.2%. While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 3.8% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 0.2%. Story Continues Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Ezcorp. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.6% over the past month. Bottom Line Ezcorp has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. This combination positions Ezcorp well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.

(EZPW): A Bull Case Theory Ricardo Pillai Wed, Nov 6, 2024, 7:34 PM 4 min read In This Article: EZPW -0.67% We came across a bullish thesis on EZCORP, Inc. (EZPW) on Value Degen\u2019s Substack by Unemployed Value Degen. In this article, we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on EZPW. EZCORP, Inc. (EZPW)'s share was trading at $11.53 as of Nov 4 th . EZPW\u2019s trailing and forward P/E were 9.61 and 9.15 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A loan officer discussing the terms of a loan with a customer in a pawn store office. EZCORP (EZPW) presents a compelling investment opportunity\u00a0and it is well-positioned to benefit from the economic divergence in a K-shaped recovery and the rapid growth in Latin America. In a K-shaped economy, wealthier individuals continue to thrive while the middle class faces mounting financial pressures, which drives sustained demand for pawnbroking services. This trend is particularly strong in Latin America, where economic growth has accelerated since the Covid-19 pandemic. EZCORP's pawnbroking model thrives on high-interest, short-term loans backed by valuable assets like jewelry. Jewelry makes up 60-65% of the company\u2019s U.S. inventory and roughly 30% of its inventory in Latin America. By focusing on larger loans against jewelry, EZCORP is gaining competitive traction in a fragmented market. With rising precious metal prices\u2014up by 30% over the past year\u2014EZCORP's significant jewelry inventory, valued at $171 million, stands to appreciate, creating a favorable financial boost when these assets are sold. The company also benefits from Latin America's economic momentum, especially in Mexico, where GDP per capita has grown at an impressive 7% annual rate since 2020. Mexico\u2019s lower labor costs, at around one-third of China\u2019s, and its access to Texas energy resources support EZCORP's expansion in the region. With 1,258 locations as of Q3 2024, EZCORP operates 541 stores in the U.S., accounting for 40% of its locations but generating 80% of its EBITDA. This is due to the company\u2019s recent turnaround focus in the U.S., while improvements in Latin America, where it also operates in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, are still gaining traction. Activist investor Kanen Wealth Management, which holds a 4% stake, has driven a strategy emphasizing U.S. profitability, leading to increased stability and growth. Over the past four years, EZCORP has expanded its store count by 5.5% annually, with revenues growing 8.5% per year and gross profit bouncing back significantly from pandemic lows. EZCORP\u2019s historical issues, however, remain relevant, particularly regarding governance. Phillip Cohen, the executive chairman, has held control since 1989, and the board\u2019s stability has enabled questionable capital allocation decisions, including failed acquisitions outside of the core business. EZCORP\u2019s underperformance compared to FirstCash (FCFS), which has almost identical margins but a far better return record, underscores these challenges. The recent activist-driven turnaround has improved financial discipline, but the company\u2019s convertible debt of $300 million\u2014restructured multiple times\u2014continues to weigh on the balance sheet. Although management has authorized buybacks, only $3 million was used last quarter, even with a stock valuation significantly below tangible book value. Story Continues EZCORP\u2019s valuation highlights its potential: it trades at a substantial discount to peers, with a price-to-book ratio of 0.79 compared to FCFS\u2019s 2.37, a price-to-sales ratio of 0.86 versus FCFS\u2019s 1.43. If management remains disciplined, reducing debt and avoiding poor acquisitions, a re-rating of EZCORP\u2019s stock could yield significant upside, potentially tripling in value. Although governance concerns persist, the company\u2019s exposure to Latin America, rising precious metal prices, and demand from lower-income segments provides a unique growth story. Despite some caution around management, EZCORP is a promising investment candidate for those looking to capitalize on a growing business with deep-value potential. EZCORP, Inc.

Shouldn't Overlook Ezcorp (EZPW) Zacks Equity Research Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 8:45 PM 3 min read In This Article: EZPW -0.67% Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all. By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss. However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects. Our proprietary system currently recommends Ezcorp (EZPW) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank. Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this consumer financial services company a great growth pick right now. Earnings Growth Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration. While the historical EPS growth rate for Ezcorp is 23.1%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 11.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 4.6%. Cash Flow Growth While cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds. Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Ezcorp is 15.4%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -8.2%. While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 3.1% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 0.2%. Story Continues Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions Beyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. The current-year earnings estimates for Ezcorp have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.6% over the past month. Bottom Line Ezcorp has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. This combination positions Ezcorp well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.

This exceptional performance is a testament to our 8,000+ team members, whose dedication to delivering market-leading customer service has driven these outstanding operating and financial results.

Story Continues \u201cDuring the quarter, we grew our footprint by adding 21 stores, including one acquired store in the U.S. and 20 de novo stores in Latin America. We continue to focus on strategic expansion and our fiscal 2024 results reflect the resurgence of our Latin American business, with adjusted segment contribution increasing 41% to $38.2 million. We now operate 1,279 stores across five countries.

We will continue to invest in our people, technology, and store network to drive sustainable growth and enhance operational efficiency, and we are well-positioned to build upon our momentum and capitalize on new growth opportunities as we deliver long-term value for our shareholders,\u201d concluded Given. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Three Months Ended September 30 As Reported Adjusted 1 in millions, except per share amounts 2024 2023 2024 2023 Total revenues $ 294.6 $ 270.5 $ 300.9 $ 270.5 Gross profit $ 175.4 $ 159.4 $ 178.9 $ 159.4 Income before tax $ 26.3 $ 13.1 $ 27.4 $ 22.6 Net income $ 15.2 $ 10.3 $ 18.9 $ 17.3 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.21 $ 0.15 $ 0.26 $ 0.23 EBITDA (non-GAAP measure) $ 35.5 $ 22.4 $ 36.7 $ 31.9 Twelve Months Ended September 30 As Reported Adjusted 1 in millions, except per share amounts 2024 2023 2024 2023 Total revenues $ 1,161.6 $ 1,049.0 $ 1,153.8 $ 1,049.0 Gross profit $ 682.3 $ 609.8 $ 678.0 $ 609.8 Income before tax $ 115.6 $ 51.6 $ 114.9 $ 93.9 Net income $ 83.1 $ 38.5 $ 84.7 $ 70.9 Diluted earnings per share $ 1.10 $ 0.53 $ 1.12 $ 0.93 EBITDA $ 151.7 $ 92.8 $ 150.8 $ 131.5 PLO increased 12% to $274.1 million, up $28.3\u00a0million. On a same-store basis, PLO increased 11% due to improved operational performance and continued strong pawn demand. In the fourth quarter, total revenues increased 9%, and gross profit increased 10%, reflecting improved pawn service charge (PSC) revenues and merchandise sales as a result of higher average PLO. Similarly for the full year, total revenues increased 11% and gross profit increased 12%. PSC increased 10% in the fourth quarter and 14% for the full year as a result of higher average PLO. For the fourth quarter, merchandise sales gross margin remains within our target range at 35%, down from 36%. Aged general merchandise was 1.7% of total general merchandise inventory, a 150 bps improvement over the third quarter. For the full year, merchandise sales gross profit margin was flat at 36%. Net\u00a0inventory increased 15%, as expected with the growth in PLO. Inventory turnover decreased to 2.6x for the quarter, from 2.7x and was flat at 2.8x for the year. For the fourth quarter, store expenses increased 7% and 5% on a same-store basis. For the full year, store expenses increased 10% and 9% on a same-store basis, primarily due to increased labor driven by inflationary and minimum wage increases, and, to a lesser extent, expenses related to rent. General and administrative expenses increased 11% in the fourth quarter and increased 12% for the full year, primarily due to labor including incentive compensation and, to a lesser extent, costs related to the implementation and ongoing support of Workday. For the fourth quarter, income before taxes was $26.3 million, up 100% from $13.1 million, and adjusted EBITDA increased 15% to $36.7 million. For the full year, income before taxes increased by 124% to $115.6 million from $51.6 million and adjusted EBITDA increased 15% to $150.8 million. Diluted\u00a0earnings per share was $0.21 for the fourth quarter, up from $0.15. On an adjusted basis, diluted\u00a0earnings\u00a0per share was $0.26, up from $0.23. For the full year, diluted earnings per share was $1.10, compared to $0.53. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share for the year was $1.12, compared to $0.93. The primary difference between GAAP and adjusted financial results for the prior year is attributable to our share of the one-time, non-cash goodwill impairment recognized by Cash Converters International. Cash\u00a0and cash equivalents\u00a0at the end of the quarter was $170.5 million, down 23% year-over-year. The decrease was due to the 2024 convertible debt maturity and payoff, an increase in PLO and inventory, strategic investments and acquisitions, and share repurchases, partially offset by cash from operating activities. SEGMENT RESULTS U.S. Pawn PLO ended the year at $214.3 million, up 12% on a total and same-store basis. In the fourth quarter, total revenues increased 9% and gross profit increased 10%, reflecting higher PSC and merchandise sales. Similarly for the full year, total revenues increased 10% and gross profit increased 10%. PSC increased\u00a010% in the fourth quarter and increased 13% for the full year as a result of\u00a0higher average PLO. During the fourth quarter, merchandise sales increased 7%, and gross margin decreased to 37% from 38%. For the full year, merchandise sales increased 6% and merchandise sales gross profit margin decreased 100 bps to 37%. Net\u00a0inventory increased 8%, as expected with the growth in PLO. Inventory turnover increased to 2.5x for the quarter, from 2.4x and was flat at 2.6x for the full year. Aged general merchandise increased to 2.6%, or $1.2 million of total general merchandise inventory. Compared to the third quarter, this has decreased by 240 bps. Excluding luxury handbags in our three Max Pawn stores in Las Vegas, aged general merchandise remains under 1%. In the fourth quarter, store expenses increased 10% (7% on a same-store basis), primarily due to labor costs driven by inflation. Similarly for the full year, store expenses increased 9% (8% on a same store basis). Segment\u00a0contribution increased 10% to $41.0 million in the fourth quarter and increased 13% to $165.3 million for the full year. Segment store count increased by 13 to 542 due to the acquisition of 13 stores, the addition of one de novo store and the consolidation of one store during the full year. Latin America Pawn PLO\u00a0improved to $59.8 million, up 8% (18% on constant currency basis). On a same-store basis, PLO increased 7% (16% on a constant currency basis) due to improved operational performance and increased loan demand. In the fourth quarter, total revenues were up 9% (17% on constant currency basis), and gross profit increased 11% (20% on a constant currency basis), reflecting increased PSC, higher merchandise sales and improved merchandise sales gross profit. Similarly for the full year, total revenues were up 13% (11% on a constant currency basis), while gross profit increased by 18% (15% on a constant currency basis). PSC increased in the fourth quarter to $29.2 million, up 11% (19% on a constant currency basis)\u00a0as a result of\u00a0higher average PLO. Similarly for the full year, PSC increased 17% (14% on a constant currency basis). During the fourth quarter merchandise sales increased 6% and merchandise sales gross margin increased to 32% from 30%. For the full year merchandise sales increased 12% and merchandise gross margin increased 100 bps to 32%. Net\u00a0inventory increased 42% (56% on a constant currency basis) due to increase in PLO, increase in store count and lower inventory turnover. Inventory turnover decreased to 2.8x, from 3.6x for the quarter. For the full year inventory turnover was 3.3x, down from 3.4x. Aged general merchandise remains less than 1% of total general merchandise inventory. In the fourth quarter, store expenses increased 1% (10% on a constant currency basis) and on a same-store basis decreased 1% (7% increase on a constant currency basis). Full year store expenses increased 13% (11% on a constant currency basis) and 12% (9% on a constant currency basis) on a same-store basis primarily due to increased labor headcount, in line with store activity and minimum wage increases and, to a lesser extent, rent associated with lease renewals. For the fourth quarter, segment contribution increased 59% (68% on a constant currency basis). For the full year, segment contribution was up 23% to $38.8 million (21% on a constant currency basis). On an adjusted basis, segment contribution for the fourth quarter was up 63% to $10.7 million and for the full year was up 41% to $38.2 million, with the primary prior year adjustment being the reversal of contingent consideration liability in connection with a previously completed acquisition. Segment store count increased by 35 to 737 due to the addition of 40 de novo stores and the consolidation of five stores during the full year.

We use constant currency results to evaluate our Latin America Pawn operations, which are denominated primarily in Mexican pesos, Guatemalan quetzales and other Latin American currencies. We believe that presentation of constant currency and adjusted results is meaningful and useful in understanding the activities and business metrics of our operations and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our business that, when viewed with GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. We provide non-GAAP financial information for informational purposes and to enhance understanding of our GAAP consolidated financial statements. We use this non-GAAP financial information primarily to evaluate and compare operating results across accounting periods. Readers should consider the information in addition to, but not instead of or superior to, our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. Constant currency results reported herein are calculated by translating consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations items denominated in local currency to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate from the prior-year comparable period, as opposed to the current period, in order to exclude the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations. In addition, we have an equity method investment that is denominated in Australian dollars and is translated into U.S. dollars. We used the end-of-period rate for balance sheet items and the average closing daily exchange rate on a monthly basis during the appropriate period for statement of operations items. The end-of-period and approximate average exchange rates for each applicable currency as compared to U.S. dollars as of and for the three and twelve months ended\u00a0September\u00a030, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: September 30, Three Months Ended September 30, Twelve Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 Mexican peso 19.7 17.4 18.9 17.1 17.7 18.3 Guatemalan quetzal 7.6 7.7 7.6 7.7 7.6 7.6 Honduran lempira 24.6 24.5 24.4 24.3 24.4 24.3 Australian dollar 1.4 1.6 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 Our statement of operations constant currency results reflect the monthly exchange rate fluctuations and so are not directly calculable from the above rates. Constant currency results, where presented, also exclude the foreign currency gain or loss.

Positive Points EZCORP Inc ( NASDAQ:EZPW ) reported record-breaking fiscal Q4 and full-year 2024 results, with total revenue for Q4 reaching $300.9 million, up 11% year over year. The company achieved a record PLO of $279.2 million, a 14% increase year over year, demonstrating strong demand for pawn broking services. EBITDA increased by 15% to $36.7 million, and diluted EPS climbed 13% to $0.26 per share, indicating strong profitability. EZCORP Inc ( NASDAQ:EZPW ) expanded its store footprint by adding 21 new stores, including 20 in Latin America, supporting its growth strategy. The company saw a 44% growth in EZ+ Rewards members, reaching 5.4 million globally, reflecting strong customer engagement and loyalty. Negative Points The company's cash balance declined to $171 million due to paying off a convertible note, increased PLO and inventory, and share repurchases. There was a 10% increase in expenses, which partially offset the higher PSC revenue and EBITDA growth. The tax rate was higher due to one-off items, including moving money out of Guatemala, which may affect future tax rates as Latin America becomes a larger part of net income. The company faced temporary store closures in Florida due to hurricanes, impacting short-term operations. Despite strong growth, the company anticipates gross margins to remain at the lower end of the target range due to a focus on inventory turnover. Q & A Highlights Q : The tax rate was higher this quarter. Was this a one-time occurrence, or should we expect this to continue? A : Timothy Jugmans, CFO: The higher tax rate was due to some one-off items, including moving money out of Guatemala, which incurred a withholding tax. Going forward, as Latin America becomes a larger part of our net income, there might be slight increases, but it should revert to a more consistent rate. Story Continues Q : Can you provide insights on the adoption and future potential of EZ Rewards and EZ payments? A : Lachlan Given, CEO: We have 5.4 million EZ+ members, and while growth is slowing, the focus is now on engaging this customer base. Online payments are improving store efficiency by allowing staff to focus more on customer service. The program is expanding in Mexico and other countries, offering further growth potential. Q : How have the hurricanes in Florida affected your operations? A : Timothy Jugmans, CFO: We experienced temporary store closures, but our team efficiently reopened them. While there was a short-term slowdown, we expect no long-term impact. Q : With inflation steadying in the US, are you seeing changes in customer behavior? A : Lachlan Given, CEO: Customer demand remains robust across all regions, with strong growth in loans and sales. Jewelry has been a significant driver, and we remain optimistic about future growth. Q : Can you discuss the recent acquisition of an auto pawn business in Mexico? A : Lachlan Given, CEO: We are finalizing the acquisition of 53 stores in Mexico. This strategic move addresses the growing importance of auto pawn in the region, where competitors have been successful. We aim to close the deal soon.

AAT. 5 Value Stocks with Exciting EV-to-EBITDA Ratios to Snap Up The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is broadly considered the yardstick for evaluating the fair market value of a stock. It is preferred by many investors while handpicking stocks trading at attractive prices. However, even this universally used valuation multiple is not without its limitations. While P/E is the most popular valuation metric, a more complicated multiple called EV-to-EBITDA works even better. Often considered a better alternative to P/E, it gives the true picture of a company\u2019s valuation and earnings potential, and has a more complete approach to valuation. While P/E considers a firm\u2019s equity portion, EV-to-EBITDA determines its total value. El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. , EZCORP, Inc. , OppFi Inc. , Lincoln National Corp. and American Assets Trust, Inc. are some stocks with attractive EV-to-EBITDA ratios. Is EV-to-EBITDA a Better Substitute to P/E? EV-to-EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company\u2019s market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents. EBITDA, the other component of the multiple, gives a better idea of a company\u2019s profitability as it removes the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows. Just like P/E, the lower the EV-to-EBITDA ratio, the more attractive it is. A low EV-to-EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued. EV-to-EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company\u2019s balance sheet, which the P/E ratio does not. Due to this reason, EV-to-EBITDA is generally used to value the potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume. Stocks boasting a low EV-to-EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates. Another shortcoming of P/E is that it can\u2019t be used to value a loss-making firm. A company\u2019s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. On the other hand, EV-to-EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value loss-making but EBITDA-positive companies. EV-to-EBITDA is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. It can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt. Story Continues But EV-to-EBITDA has its limitations, too. The ratio varies across industries (a high-growth industry typically has a higher multiple and vice versa) and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries, given their diverse capital requirements. A strategy solely based on EV-to-EBITDA might not yield the desired results. However, you can club it with the other major ratios in your stock-investing toolbox, such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to screen value stocks.

{"text": "5 Value Stocks With Exciting EV-to-EBITDA Ratios to Snap Up Now Anindya Barman Fri, Dec 6, 2024, 3:21 PM 6 min read In This Article: LOCO +1.52% AAT -0.66% LNC -3.56% The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is broadly considered the yardstick for evaluating the fair market value of a stock. It is preferred by many investors while handpicking stocks trading at attractive prices. However, even this universally used valuation multiple is not without its limitations. While P/E is the most popular valuation metric, a more complicated multiple called EV-to-EBITDA works even better. Often considered a better alternative to P/E, it gives the true picture of a company\u2019s valuation and earnings potential, and has a more complete approach to valuation. While P/E considers a firm\u2019s equity portion, EV-to-EBITDA determines its total value. El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. LOCO, EZCORP, Inc. EZPW, OppFi Inc. OPFI, Lincoln National Corporation LNC and American Assets Trust, Inc. AAT are some stocks with attractive EV-to-EBITDA ratios. Is EV-to-EBITDA a Better Substitute to P/E? EV-to-EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company\u2019s market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents. EBITDA, the other component of the multiple, gives a better idea of a company\u2019s profitability as it removes the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows. Just like P/E, the lower the EV-to-EBITDA ratio, the more attractive it is. A low EV-to-EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued. EV-to-EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company\u2019s balance sheet, which the P/E ratio does not. Due to this reason, EV-to-EBITDA is generally used to value the potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume. Stocks boasting a low EV-to-EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates. Another shortcoming of P/E is that it can\u2019t be used to value a loss-making firm. A company\u2019s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. On the other hand, EV-to-EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value loss-making but EBITDA-positive companies. EV-to-EBITDA is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. It can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt. But EV-to-EBITDA has its limitations, too. The ratio varies across industries (a high-growth industry typically has a higher multiple and vice versa) and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries, given their diverse capital requirements. A strategy solely based on EV-to-EBITDA might not yield the desired results. However, you can club it with the other major ratios in your stock-investing toolbox, such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to screen value stocks. Story Continues Screening Criteria Here are the parameters to screen for value stocks: EV-to-EBITDA 12 Months-Most Recent less than X-Industry Median: A lower EV-to-EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation. P/E using (F1) less than X-Industry Median: This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers. P/B less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued. P/S less than X-Industry Median: The lower the P/S ratio, the more attractive the stock is, as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company.

events can spark as much market excitement as new analyst coverage. Whether it\u2019s a small-cap stock gaining visibility or a well-known name receiving a fresh perspective, analyst reports have the power to shift sentiment, boost liquidity, and validate an investor\u2019s thesis. But why does new coverage matter, and how can you use it to your advantage? For perceptive investors, recognizing the impact of new analyst attention can reveal opportunities to profit from price fluctuations or harness long-term growth potential. Let\u2019s dive deeper into why this market development deserves your focus. Limbach Holdings, Inc. LMB, EZCORP, Inc. EZPW and Laureate Education, Inc. LAUR are three stocks that have witnessed new analyst coverage lately. These are, therefore, expected to attract investor attention. Why Analyst Coverage Commands Attention When analysts at leading firms initiate coverage on a stock, they bring with them a network of institutional clients and comprehensive financial analysis. They are often experts in specific industries or sectors, leveraging their specialized knowledge to conduct in-depth research and analysis. Analysts provide investors with crucial insights into a company\u2019s financial performance, growth prospects, competitive position, and industry dynamics\u2014information that can be challenging for individual investors to obtain on their own. Do analysts add value to companies by initiating coverage? Absolutely. Their role as intermediaries grants them access to a wealth of relevant data, which they refine into actionable insights. Many investors rely heavily on analysts\u2019 research, recognizing that a lack of information could lead to market inefficiencies. Stocks selected for coverage are not chosen arbitrarily. New coverage generally reflects the analyst\u2019s confidence in the company\u2019s prospects. Sometimes, heightened investor interest in a particular stock prompts analysts to focus on it, aligning their efforts with market demand. Consequently, ratings for newly covered stocks often tend to be more favorable compared to those of stocks that are already under continuous coverage. Furthermore, a shift in the average broker recommendation holds more significance than an isolated recommendation change. When an analyst issues a recommendation for a company with minimal or no existing coverage, it often captures investors' attention. This, in turn, can attract portfolio managers to take positions in the stock, as additional information surfaces. Story Continues How Analyst Coverage Impacts Stock Performance Analyst coverage can significantly impact stock performance by triggering various market reactions. The announcement of new coverage can cause immediate fluctuations in stock price. Positive ratings can attract bullish investors, while neutral or negative ratings may spark sell-offs. Meanwhile, consistent, positive coverage from multiple analysts can contribute to sustained investor confidence, potentially leading to higher valuations. Conversely, if the coverage reveals previously unrecognized risks, it can hinder long-term performance. Overall, new analyst coverage can act as a spotlight, illuminating stocks that might otherwise go unnoticed. Whether you\u2019re discovering a hidden gem or gaining a fresh perspective on a well-known company, these reports can be a powerful addition to your investment toolkit. Are there newly covered stocks on your radar? Now might be the perfect time to dig deeper and uncover your next winning investment. So, it\u2019s a good strategy to bet on stocks that have seen increased analyst coverage over the last few weeks. Screening Criteria The Number of Broker Ratings is greater than the Number of Broker Ratings four weeks ago (this will shortlist stocks that have recent new coverage). Average Broker Rating less than Average Broker Rating four weeks ago (\u201cless than\u201d means \u201cbetter than\u201d four weeks ago). Increased analyst coverage and improving average rating are the primary criteria of this strategy, but one should also consider other relevant parameters to make it foolproof. Here are the other screening parameters: Price greater than or equal to $5 (as a stock below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors). Average Daily Volume greater than or equal to 100,000 shares (if the volume isn\u2019t enough, it will not attract individual investors).
