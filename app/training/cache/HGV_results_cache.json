[{"text": "BSI sets standards for HGV charging infrastructure The code of practice is designed to ensure the safe implementation of charging infrastructure \u00b7 Motor Finance GlobalData Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 6:20 PM 2 min read The British Standards Institution (BSI) has published a new set of guidelines, BSI Flex 2071 2.0, to standardise the development and operation of public heavy goods vehicle (HGV) charging sites. The code of practice is designed to ensure the safe implementation of charging infrastructure, particularly at motorway service areas and truck stops. The BSI Flex 2071 2.0 provides a comprehensive framework covering various aspects of charging site development. It includes a standardised vocabulary and units of measurement, recommendations for charging site layouts, and guidelines on public access. The document also addresses the segregation of different vehicle types, such as HGVs, public service vehicles (PSVs), and vans, as well as the interaction between vehicles and pedestrians. RHA Net Zero policy lead Chris Ashley said: \u201cI strongly welcome these standards from the British Standards Institute. We know that hauliers and coach operators will want to charge their vehicles en route at truck stops and motorway service areas. \"With the publication of these standards, another important piece of the Net Zero jigsaw puzzle falls into place to allow operators and charge point providers to plan for this provision.\u201d Safety and design implications are a key focus of the BSI Flex standards. These considerations are crucial for logistics providers, electrical grid suppliers, consumer groups, and any other stakeholders involved with charging sites or battery-electric HGVs. The standards aim to facilitate the deployment of battery-electric HGVs and the necessary charging infrastructure by addressing operational planning, access, layouts, safety, welfare, and security. A harmonised approach, as outlined in the BSI Flex, is expected to assist designers and operators in ensuring better interoperability and accessibility of charging sites. It could also provide additional risk management and safety considerations, especially important for sites offering multiple fuel options. \"BSI sets standards for HGV charging infrastructure\" was originally created and published by Motor Finance Online , a GlobalData owned brand.

In October 2024, Network Rail Group Property, the commercial division accountable for the management of all of Network Rail's land and property assets, had its first independent planning submission unanimously approved by the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) \u2013 the Bow Goods Yard Project. Located in East London, Bow Goods Yard is the last major parcel of land to be regenerated as part of the London Olympics legacy, with the approved masterplan set to revamp over 30 acres of brownfield land into a rail freight campus and last-mile logistics hub. In its current form, Bow Goods Yard is a major supply point to the city\u2019s construction industry, supplying over one million tonnes of concrete and aggregates each year, and removing an equivalent amount of construction spoil. An isolated spot, large parts of Bow Goods Yard aren\u2019t accessible to the local community, and many residents overlooking the site consider it a dusty eyesore. Becoming a better neighbour Those involved in the design of the masterplan have ensured Network Rail\u2019s new centralised rail and freight operations will \"be a better neighbour\" to surrounding communities, while also expanding its light and heavy industrial capacity. It aims to achieve this by reducing the impact of freight operations on the local community, in part by moving it to the far part of the site nearer the rail head and covering over aggregate storage. It will also provide the surrounding community with up to 21,000m 2 of office space, 36,000m 2 for leisure use and up to 7,000m 2 of new public green open spaces alongside the Olympic Park. Furthermore, the new and updated facilities are anticipated to create approximately 5,000 jobs (including construction-related roles) and add between \u00a390m-\u00a3150m a year to the local economy. Network Rail says that the greenway will be a central feature of the redevelopment. Credit: Network Rail \u201cPrevious applications have been very inward-looking and the site has been under considerable pressure for some years to redevelop as a better neighbour,\u201d notes Ushma Samani, real estate development manager, Network Rail. \u201cAs a strategic industrial freight site, it was important to safeguard these operations in propensity, but lessons learnt from previous applications really helped shape how we\u2019re working with our tenants and neighbours. We\u2019re not just looking at sustainability from an environmental perspective, we\u2019re also looking at constructability and the socio-economic benefits we want to bring to our site.\u201d Community engagement The team behind this project worked closely with local communities and businesses to ensure they understood their needs and concerns. This involved extensive early-stage community engagement in the form of attending existing community events and visiting local schools to ask what people liked and didn\u2019t like about the area and whether there were things Network Rail could proactively do to improve it. Story Continues \u201cWe had a local specialist engagement company out doing young designer programmes; even walks around the perimeter of the site to really capture local voices. We went to our Greenway partners\u2026 we met with everyone on our key boundaries. It\u2019s the most extensive engagement exercise I\u2019ve ever been part of,\u201d says Samani. In total the engagement team participated in 45 in-person events, receiving input from 700 people, as well as consulting with the surrounding boroughs of Tower Hamlets and Newham. This information was then used to develop a community charter and inform how the site\u2019s space would be best utilised, resulting in near-unanimous support for the proposed designs. Maximising freight capacity Network Rail approached the Bow Goods Yard project as a way of demonstrating corporate responsibility and showcasing what is possible when sustainability is embedded into design. One of the key strategic objectives was to maximise the freight capacity of the existing railhead, whilst minimising the impact on local residents, making the most of what has historically been an underutilised site. This included consolidating industrial heavy freight, introducing lighter industrial freight and then opening up the rest of the site to softer, public-facing uses closer to the Greenway footpath and cycleway, Olympic Park and transport nodes. \u201cWe\u2019ve reconfigured the heavy freight area to maximise capacity, through which we\u2019ve been able to achieve a 30% increase,\u201d says David Clarke, freight estate development lead at Network Rail Group Properties. \u201cThis includes replacing a road-fed concrete plant with a rail-fed one and expanding aggregate storage \u2013 but upwards rather than outwards, which enables us to introduce a second concrete plant. This optimisation will double the potential for concrete in East London to come through this site. Proposals for the project include the introduction of an integrated last-mile logistics hub. Credit: Network Rail \u201cThe masterplan also includes a new express freight platform for lighter parcel and/or retail goods last-mile delivery, which will be market-led,\" Clarke continues. \"It\u2019s estimated this could take up to 50,000 HGVs off the road \u2013 while the heavy freight could reduce HGV numbers by an additional 40,000. That\u2019s pretty powerful stuff.\u201d In terms of green public spaces, Bow Goods Yard\u2019s new public realm will enhance the Greenway bank and Old Ford Wood, adding 150 trees and new pedestrian and cycle routes. Samani is particularly proud of the fact the masterplan offers a minimum 10% biodiversity net gain without any offsetting. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at green roofs and walls, renewable energy through PV panels , and street-side planting as part of a sustainable urban drainage system (SUDS), which will also enable us to harvest and recycle water,\u201d she gives as examples. Flexibility for futureproofing It\u2019s also worth noting that flexibility has been written into the masterplan to ensure the site is futureproofed. \u201cThis is a 30-50-year facility, hence we\u2019re looking ahead at multi-modal and last mile,\u201d Clarke notes. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a whole team at Network Rail trying to encourage that. It\u2019s all about safeguarding for the future. We\u2019ve also built in flexibility in terms of changing construction techniques in the future, or new market opportunities.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s been massive capacity assessment around electric vehicles and what might be needed,\u201d Samani explains. \u201cWe envisage electric vans and smaller vehicles rather than big diesel HGVs doing that last mile piece, so we\u2019ve made sure to futureproof for on-site parking that will be suitable for electric vehicles.\u201d Looking forward, the next step for Bow Goods Yard is to get Phase One of the project detailed consent worked up and submitted, which Clarke hopes to achieve by the end of 2025. \u201cIt\u2019s quite an ambitious bill, but it feels doable, given how much work we\u2019ve already done,\u201d he says. \u201cThis will probably entail the freight aspect of the site and some commercial development. The wider work could easily be a 10-year programme.\" \"Bow Goods Yard: London\u2019s Olympic legacy continues\" was originally created and published by Railway Technology , a GlobalData owned brand.

Why Zacks Equity Research Tue, Jan 7, 2025, 5:47 PM 5 min read In This Article: HGV +0.27% NCLH +1.32% Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. HGV is focusing on diversifying its product portfolio and expanding global market reach through accretive buyouts and partnerships. The adequate mix of product offerings and favorable pricing benefits the company by ensuring cost synergies and enhancing its business growth. Furthermore, a balanced capital allocation approach, prioritizing shareholder value, is aiding it. This Florida-based company\u2019s shares have gained 6.2% in the past three months underperforming the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector while outperforming the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry and the S&P 500 Index. Notably, from the chart given below it can be observed that the median share price performance of HGV is better than its peers. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The Zacks Consensus Estimate of the company\u2019s 2025 earnings per share (EPS) has moved south to $3.55 from $3.63 in the past 60 days. However, the estimated value indicates 3.4% year-over-year growth. Its growth prospects are further solidified by a VGM Score of B, backed by Value and Momentum Scores of A. The positive trend signifies bullish analysts\u2019 sentiments, robust fundamentals and the prospects of an outperformance in the near term. Although Hilton Grand effectively ensures cost synergies and maintains operational efficiencies, the increasing cost and expense structure is somewhat marring its bottom line. Let us discuss the factors why investors must retain this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock for now. HGV\u2019s Growth Driving Factors Incremental Buyouts & Partnerships: Hilton Grand engages in exploring new business opportunities for product diversification and in new or existing markets through accretive acquisitions and strategic collaborations. On Jan. 17, 2024, the company acquired the Bluegreen Vacations Holding Corporation for approximately $1.6 billion. This buyout intends to broaden HGV\u2019s offerings, customer reach and sales locations, adding nearly 200 properties in 14 new regions and eight new states. Furthermore, on Dec. 1, 2023, the company acquired BRE Grand Islander Parent LLC for $117 million. Apart from acquisitions, HGV\u2019s partnerships with Bass Pro Shops and Great Wolf Lodge add notable value to its business enhancement initiatives. In November 2023, the company entered into a 10-year exclusive marketing agreement with Bass Pro to market and sell vacation packages at kiosks in Bass Pro\u2019s and Cabela\u2019s retail locations and through other means. As of Sept. 30, 2024, Hilton Grand had sales and marketing operations at 132 Bass Pro Shops and Cabela\u2019s Stores, including nine virtual kiosks. Moreover, in the third quarter of 2024, the company opened four new retail outlets in Great Wolf locations and is expected to have opened four additional outlets by the end of 2024. Rebranding Efforts: Hilton Grand is undergoing several rebranding initiatives to realize cost synergies and enhance its business portfolio. These efforts position the company to explore several opportunities and expand its growth momentum in the competitive industry. The company is currently undergoing a rebranding of many of the Diamond properties and expects to rebrand the majority of Bluegreen properties, which is expected to be done by 2026. In 2024, about 80% of Diamond properties were rebranded. The majority of the rebranded assets will operate under Hilton Vacation Club properties, with a handful of unique properties becoming part of the Hilton Grand Vacations brand. The company is also optimistic about introducing HGV Max to the Bluegreen system, providing Bluegreen members access to the top-tier Hilton ecosystem. It believes that this revolutionary launch will attract new buyers and motivate existing owners to upgrade their memberships. Rewarding Shareholders: Through a balanced capital allocation strategy, HGV has been ensuring shareholder value and investing free cash flow for business enhancement activities. The primary priorities include supporting business growth through reinvestment, returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases or dividends and exploring opportunities for high-ROI strategic mergers and acquisitions. During the first nine months of 2024, Hilton Grand repurchased 7.4 million shares for $307 million. Furthermore, the company\u2019s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) reflects its growth potential and focus on maintaining shareholder value. Its ROE of 16.4% compares favorably with the industry\u2019s 5.4%, indicating more efficiency in using shareholders\u2019 funds than peers. Story Continues What\u2019s Hindering Hilton Grand\u2019s Momentum? The company has been witnessing high operating expenses due to increased expenses across sales and marketing, resort and club management, rental and ancillary services, and financing. Also, acquisition and integration-related expenses, mainly due to the Bluegreen Vacations acquisition, are headwinds. During the first nine months of 2024, HGV\u2019s total operating expenses increased year over year to $3.37 billion from $2.50 billion.

shareholders have endured a 27% loss from investing in the stock three years ago editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Thu, Jan 9, 2025, 3:24 PM 3 min read In This Article: HGV +0.27% Many investors define successful investing as beating the market average over the long term. But in any portfolio, there are likely to be some stocks that fall short of that benchmark. We regret to report that long term Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. ( NYSE:HGV ) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 27% in three years, versus a market return of about 24%. So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Hilton Grand Vacations To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement. Hilton Grand Vacations became profitable within the last five years. That would generally be considered a positive, so we are surprised to see the share price is down. So given the share price is down it's worth checking some other metrics too. Revenue is actually up 21% over the three years, so the share price drop doesn't seem to hinge on revenue, either. It's probably worth investigating Hilton Grand Vacations further; while we may be missing something on this analysis, there might also be an opportunity. You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). NYSE:HGV Earnings and Revenue Growth January 9th 2025 We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecasts A Different Perspective While the broader market gained around 25% in the last year, Hilton Grand Vacations shareholders lost 7.4%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 2% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should learn about the 4 warning signs we've spotted with Hilton Grand Vacations (including 1 which is a bit unpleasant) . Story Continues There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of undervalued small cap companies that insiders are buying.

challenges Investing.com Mon, Jan 6, 2025, 11:20 PM 1 min read In This Article: TNL +0.64% HGV +0.27% VAC -2.17% Investing.com -- Morgan Stanley initiated coverage on timeshare companies with a mixed outlook, upgrading Travel + Leisure Co (NYSE:TNL) and Hilton Grand Vacations Inc (NYSE:HGV) to \"overweight\" while assigning an \"underweight\" rating to Marriot Vacations Worldwide (NYSE:VAC). Brokerage highlighted the sector's robust pre-pandemic returns but flagged headwinds from higher interest rates. TNL, trading at an 8x forward P/E and 14% free cash flow yield has pivot to high-credit-quality customers, which Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) believes could drive beats and re-rating potential, setting a $67 price target, implying 32% upside. HGV, supported by synergies from recent acquisitions, is expected to achieve a 20% EPS CAGR through 2026, with a price target of $47, reflecting 20% upside. Whereas VAC faces risks from declining owner credit quality and a potential need to rebuild inventory, with a $87 price target indicating 3% downside. Morgan Stanley sees VAC as constrained by higher loan loss provisions and elevated costs. While timeshare stocks have underperformed over the past three years, MS noted their \"misunderstood\" potential, emphasizing that strategic shifts and stable growth prospects could drive outperformance in the sector.

TipRanks Wed, Jan 8, 2025, 1:57 PM 7 min read In This Article: TNL +0.64% HGV +0.27% This first half of the 2020s has been difficult for timeshare stocks. The shutdowns of the COVID-19 pandemic were followed by rising inflation and rising interest rates, which all pushed down hard on consumer demand. But the pandemic is well behind us now; inflation, while still slightly above the Fed\u2019s target rate, appears to be stabilizing; and the central bank is back to cutting rates. Stay Ahead of the Market: Discover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using Tipranks' Stock Screener So, while it\u2019s not surprising that timeshares have underperformed in recent years, consumers are starting to move back into them \u2013 and that opens an opportunity for investors. Analyst Stephen Grambling, covering the timeshare leisure sector for Morgan Stanley, notes that timeshare stocks are frequently underappreciated by investors \u2013 but that the industry is on the cusp of a bullish cycle. \u201cBoth consumers and investors alike often view timeshare skeptically, but the more stable-than-feared nature of the business and potential for attractive returns relative to rates can facilitate periods of outsized share price performance,\u201d Grambling opined. \u201cCurrently, the stocks are coming off an unprecedented three years of underperformance amid rising rates and normalizing leisure demand. We see potential for a return to stable growth from here vs. consensus flat, leading us to skew net positive on the stocks in 2025 but structural concerns and idiosyncratic changes to businesses warrant being tactical.\u201d Putting these sentiments into concrete terms, Grambling has picked two specific timeshare stocks as particularly attractive right now \u2013 and he\u2019s not shy about recommending both as Buys. Let\u2019s open up the TipRanks database and see how the Morgan Stanley view on these stocks stacks up against the broader Wall Street view. Travel + Leisure Company ( TNL ) The first stock we\u2019ll look at here is Travel + Leisure Company, an Orlando-based timeshare company founded in 2006 and conducting operations at resort destinations worldwide. Travel + Leisure\u2019s primary focus is on developing, selling, and managing timeshare properties, mainly located in prime vacation spots. The company\u2019s operations are conducted through a range of brand names, including such well-known ones as Wyndham, Margaritaville, and Worldmark. This vacation company\u2019s ops are split into two main categories, vacation ownership and travel & membership. The vacation ownership portfolio serves more than 800,000 timeshare owners, with properties at more than 270 resorts and vacation spots around the world. The travel & membership portfolio is based on a vacation exchange platform with 3.5 million members. Through the exchange, these members have access to over 4,000 resorts in 100 countries. Story Continues Turning to the company\u2019s financial results, we find that TNL\u2019s last reported quarter, 3Q24, had a top line of $993 million in total revenues. This was relatively flat year-over-year, and missed the forecast by $17 million. At the bottom line, the company realized a non-GAAP EPS of $1.57. This company has, in recent months, shown strong cash generation . In the nine months ending with September 30, 2024, the company\u2019s $266 million adj. free cash flow was more than triple the FCF from the first nine months of 2023 \u2013 and in Q3, the company generated $154 million of that free cash flow. Of particular interest to investors, Travel + Leisure continued its policy of returning capital to shareholders. In Q3, the company returned $105 million, through $70 million worth of share repurchases and $35 million in dividend payments. The last dividend declaration was made on November 6 and was paid out on December 13. The 50-cent common share dividend annualizes to $2 per share, and gives a forward yield of 3.9%. For Morgan Stanley\u2019s Grambling, there are several important points to keep in mind on this stock. \u201cTNL\u2019s strategic pivot to focusing on higher FICO customers\u00a0even at the expense of growth near term is finally paying off with an improvement in owner growth and potential for structurally lower defaults/ provision,\u201d the analyst said. \u201cMoreover, despite apparent stabilization in the membership segment, the stock still trades at a compelling 8.0x NTM P/E and 14% FCF yield. Look for the return to growth to catalyze both upside to estimates (we are 6%/17% above 2025 EBITDA/EPS) and a re-rating from 5.5x our 2026 to 7.5x 2026 EPS\u2026 Just as important, depressed valuation and history of steady capital return create a favorable risk adjusted reward.\u201d These comments back up Grambling\u2019s Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on TNL shares, while his $67 price target implies a 12-month upside potential of 31%. (To watch Grambling\u2019s track record, click here ) Overall, there are 8 recent analyst reviews on record for TNL shares, and their breakdown of 5 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell gives the stock its Moderate Buy consensus rating. The stock is selling for $51.23, and its $55.17 average target price indicates an 8% upside for the coming year. (See TNL stock forecast ) Hilton Grand Vacations ( HGV ) The next stock on our list, Hilton Grand Vacations, may sound familiar \u2013 because it shares a name with the famous Hilton Hotel company. Since 2017, Hilton Grand Vacations has been acting as an independent company, working as the manager and operator of Hilton\u2019s timeshare and vacation ownership brands. This gives HGV a network of resorts \u2013 approximately 168 of them \u2013 spread across 16 states plus DC in the US, with an international presence in Canada, the Caribbean, Mexico, the UK and mainland Europe, and Japan. These vacation properties are at the disposal of HGV\u2019s 722,000 members. Timeshare owners with HGV don\u2019t just have access to properties, they also have access to amenities on the properties, including such attractions as golf resorts, beachfronts, casino floors, and even ski slopes. Vacationers can find attractions keyed to adults or to families, with a wide range of activities to focus on, including shopping, spas, movies, sports, and restaurants. HGV has a history of expansion-through-acquisition, and has made two major moves in this direction in recent years. In 2021, the company acquired the upscale luxury hotel operator Diamond Resorts, in a transaction valued at $1.4 billion. More recently, HGV completed its acquisition-by-purchase of Bluegreen Vacations, in an all-cash transaction of $1.5 billion. Each of these acquisitions brings the target company\u2019s assets \u2013 resorts, destinations, attractions \u2013 into HGV\u2019s network, available for timeshare members. Based on its timeshare operations, Hilton Grand Vacations generated $1.3 billion in total revenues during 3Q24, its last reported financial period. While only $10 million better than the estimates, this revenue figure was up 27.5% year-over-year. At the bottom line, HGV\u2019s non-GAAP earnings were down year-over-year, from 98 cents per share to 67 cents per share \u2013 and missed the forecast by 5 cents. Checking in again with the Morgan Stanley view, we find that analyst Grambling is upbeat here, finding reason for optimism in this company\u2019s potential to bring improved returns going forward. He writes of the stock, \u201cHGV\u2019s acquisitions of Diamond & Bluegreen will continue to drive outsized EPS growth (20% CAGR 2024-26) through synergies and steady top-line growth. While both deals likely raise concerns about the quality of the owner base, especially on the heels of recent increases to the company\u2019s loan loss provision, the average FICO score of owners has actually held relatively stable. As a result, we see room for the company\u2019s provision to move lower over time. In addition, we expect HGV to deliver best in-class capital returns relative to its market cap (10% 2025 TSR / current market cap).\u201d Grambling puts an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on this timeshare company, along with a $47 price target that indicates room for a 23.5% upside potential on the one-year horizon. The Moderate Buy consensus rating on this stock is based on 6 recent reviews that include 4 to Buy and 1 each to Hold and Sell. The shares are priced at $38.06 and have an average price target of $47.17, practically the same as Grambling\u2019s objective.

Story Continues Aggregate materials enhance road durability, load-bearing capacity, and infrastructure quality, enabling the development of larger and more efficient road networks. For instance, in May 2024, the UK Department for Transport reported that between 2022 and 2023, car traffic on Great Britain's 'A' roads rose by 3.3% to 111.6 billion vehicle miles, and van traffic increased by 1% to 24.3 billion vehicle miles. Consequently, the surge in road transportation is fueling the growth of the aggregate in road construction market. Leading companies in the aggregate in road construction market are focusing on the development of innovative products such as carbon-neutral asphalt materials to align with Aggregate Industries' commitment to reducing emissions and achieving net-zero construction. Carbon-neutral asphalt is designed to either eliminate or offset carbon emissions, resulting in a net-zero environmental impact in terms of carbon dioxide. For example, in March 2024, AGGREGATE Industries, a UK-based construction materials company, introduced Foamix Eco, a carbon-neutral, cold-lay asphalt containing a high percentage of recycled materials. This innovation reduces reliance on virgin resources and minimizes energy consumption during production, while also promoting on-site recycling, lowering HGV movements, and decreasing the carbon footprint, offering a cost-effective, eco-friendly solution that supports net-zero construction objectives. In June 2024, Aggregate Industries, a UK-based construction and building materials company, acquired Land Recovery Ltd. for an undisclosed amount. This acquisition positions Aggregate Industries to strengthen its role as a leader in the construction and building materials sector by offering high-quality products and sustainable solutions. Land Recovery Ltd. is a UK-based provider of primary and recycled materials, including aggregates for road construction.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 5 Quality Compounder Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. (NYSE:HGV) Now? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Fri, Dec 13, 2024, 2:37 PM 3 min read In This Article: HGV +0.27% While Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. ( NYSE:HGV ) might not have the largest market cap around , it saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. Shareholders may appreciate the recent price jump, but the company still has a way to go before reaching its yearly highs again. With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Hilton Grand Vacations\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Hilton Grand Vacations What's The Opportunity In Hilton Grand Vacations? According to our price multiple model, where we compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. We\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there\u2019s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock\u2019s ratio of 42.05x is currently well-above the industry average of 24.21x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Hilton Grand Vacations\u2019s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market. What does the future of Hilton Grand Vacations look like? NYSE:HGV Earnings and Revenue Growth December 13th 2024 Future outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double in the upcoming, the future appears to be extremely bright for Hilton Grand Vacations. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation. What This Means For You Are you a shareholder? HGV\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question \u2013 is now the right time to sell? If you believe HGV should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed. Story Continues Are you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on HGV for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for HGV, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop. With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

to Avoid HGV and One Stock to Buy Instead Petr Hu\u0159\u0165\u00e1k Fri, Dec 13, 2024, 3:21 PM 3 min read In This Article: HGV +0.27% Three Reasons to Avoid HGV and One Stock to Buy Instead Since June 2024, Hilton Grand Vacations has been in a holding pattern, posting a small loss of 1.9% while floating around $40.28. The stock also fell short of the S&P 500\u2019s 11.9% gain during that period. Is there a buying opportunity in Hilton Grand Vacations, or does it present a risk to your portfolio? Get the full stock story straight from our expert analysts, it\u2019s free . We don't have much confidence in Hilton Grand Vacations. Here are three reasons why there are better opportunities than HGV and a stock we'd rather own. Why Is Hilton Grand Vacations Not Exciting? Spun off from Hilton Worldwide in 2017, Hilton Grand Vacations (NYSE:HGV) is a global timeshare company that provides travel experiences for its customers through its timeshare resorts and club membership programs. 1. Lackluster Revenue Growth We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within consumer discretionary, a stretched historical view may miss a company riding a successful new property or trend. Hilton Grand Vacations\u2019s recent history shows its demand slowed as its annualized revenue growth of 12.7% over the last two years is below its five-year trend. Hilton Grand Vacations Year-On-Year Revenue Growth 2. EPS Trending Down Analyzing the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) shows whether a company's incremental sales were profitable \u2013 for example, revenue could be inflated through excessive spending on advertising and promotions. Sadly for Hilton Grand Vacations, its EPS declined by 20.6% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 20.3%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded. Hilton Grand Vacations Trailing 12-Month EPS (GAAP) 3. High Debt Levels Increase Risk As long-term investors, the risk we care about most is the permanent loss of capital, which can happen when a company goes bankrupt or raises money from a disadvantaged position. This is separate from short-term stock price volatility, something we are much less bothered by. Hilton Grand Vacations\u2019s $13.31 billion of debt exceeds the $297 million of cash on its balance sheet. Furthermore, its 12\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio (based on its EBITDA of $1.11 billion over the last 12 months) shows the company is overleveraged. Hilton Grand Vacations Net Cash Position At this level of debt, incremental borrowing becomes increasingly expensive and credit agencies could downgrade the company\u2019s rating if profitability falls. Hilton Grand Vacations could also be backed into a corner if the market turns unexpectedly \u2013 a situation we seek to avoid as investors in high-quality companies. We hope Hilton Grand Vacations can improve its balance sheet and remain cautious until it increases its profitability or pays down its debt. Story Continues Final Judgment Hilton Grand Vacations isn\u2019t a terrible business, but it doesn\u2019t pass our quality test. With its shares underperforming the market lately, the stock trades at 13.3\u00d7 forward EV-to-EBITDA (or $40.28 per share). While this valuation is reasonable, we don\u2019t really see a big opportunity at the moment. We're pretty confident there are superior stocks to buy right now. We\u2019d suggest looking at Cloudflare, one of our top software picks that could be a home run with edge computing . Stocks We Would Buy Instead of Hilton Grand Vacations The elections are now behind us.

Vacation Providers Stocks Q3 Highlights: Hilton Grand Vacations (NYSE:HGV) Max Juang Thu, Nov 21, 2024, 12:12 PM 5 min read In This Article: HGV +0.27% THWWW 0.00% PLYA +0.83% SABR +0.15% Travel and

Market Update As a result of the Fed's rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has come down from frothy levels post-pandemic. The general rise in the price of goods and services is trending towards the Fed's 2% goal as of late, which is good news. The higher rates that fought inflation also didn't slow economic activity enough to catalyze a recession. So far, soft landing. This, combined with recent rate cuts (half a percent in September 2024 and a quarter percent in November 2024) have led to strong stock market performance in 2024. The icing on the cake for 2024 returns was Donald Trump's victory in the US Presidential Election in early November, sending major indices to all-time highs in the week following the election. Still, debates around the health of the economy and the impact of potential tariffs and corporate tax cuts remain. Said differently, there's still much uncertainty around 2025.

Q3 Earnings Estimates Zacks Equity Research Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 4:50 PM 3 min read In This Article: HGV +0.27% Hilton Grand Vacations (HGV) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.67 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.70 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.98 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -4.29%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $0.89 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.62, delivering a surprise of -30.34%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. Hilton Grand Vacations , which belongs to the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry, posted revenues of $1.31 billion for the quarter ended September 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.48%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.02 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Hilton Grand Vacations shares have not added anything since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 24.3%. What's Next for Hilton Grand Vacations? While Hilton Grand Vacations has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Hilton Grand Vacations: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for the stock.

Timeshare vacation company Hilton Grand Vacations (NYSE:HGV) beat Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q3 CY2024, with sales up 28.3% year on year to $1.31 billion. Its GAAP profit of $0.28 per share was 60.2% below analysts\u2019 consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Hilton Grand Vacations? Find out in our full research report . Hilton Grand Vacations (HGV) Q3 CY2024 Highlights: Revenue: $1.31 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.29 billion (1.1% beat) EPS: $0.28 vs analyst estimates of $0.70 (-$0.42 miss) EBITDA: $307 million vs analyst estimates of $283.2 million (8.4% beat) Gross Margin (GAAP): 41%, up from 37.5% in the same quarter last year Operating Margin: 37.7%, up from 17.7% in the same quarter last year EBITDA Margin: 23.5%, down from 26.4% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 4.5%, down from 25.2% in the same quarter last year Members: 722,000, up 196,085 year on year Market Capitalization: $4.08 billion \u201cWe\u2019re pleased with our third quarter results, which were in line with our expectations,\u201d said Mark Wang, CEO of Hilton Grand Vacations. Company Overview Spun off from Hilton Worldwide in 2017, Hilton Grand Vacations (NYSE:HGV) is a global timeshare company that provides travel experiences for its customers through its timeshare resorts and club membership programs. Travel and Vacation Providers Airlines, hotels, resorts, and cruise line companies often sell experiences rather than tangible products, and in the last decade-plus, consumers have slowly shifted from buying \"things\" (wasteful) to buying \"experiences\" (memorable). In addition, the internet has introduced new ways of approaching leisure and lodging such as booking homes and longer-term accommodations. Traditional airlines, hotel, resorts, and cruise line companies must innovate to stay relevant in a market rife with innovation. Sales Growth Reviewing a company\u2019s long-term performance can reveal insights into its business quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one sustains growth for years. Thankfully, Hilton Grand Vacations\u2019s 20.3% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was solid. This is a useful starting point for our analysis. Hilton Grand Vacations Total Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within consumer discretionary, a stretched historical view may miss a company riding a successful new property or emerging trend. Hilton Grand Vacations\u2019s recent history shows its demand slowed as its annualized revenue growth of 12.7% over the last two years is below its five-year trend. Hilton Grand Vacations Year-On-Year Revenue Growth We can better understand the company\u2019s revenue dynamics by analyzing its number of members, which reached 722,000 in the latest quarter. Over the last two years, Hilton Grand Vacations\u2019s members averaged 16% year-on-year growth. Because this number is higher than its revenue growth during the same period, we can see the company\u2019s monetization has fallen. Story Continues Hilton Grand Vacations Members This quarter, Hilton Grand Vacations reported robust year-on-year revenue growth of 28.3%, and its $1.31 billion of revenue topped Wall Street estimates by 1.1%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 10.1% over the next 12 months, a slight deceleration versus the last two years. This projection doesn't excite us and indicates the market believes its products and services will face some demand challenges. Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

Cash Is King Although earnings are undoubtedly valuable for assessing company performance, we believe cash is king because you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills. Hilton Grand Vacations has shown weak cash profitability over the last two years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin averaged 5.7%, subpar for a consumer discretionary business. The divergence from its good operating margin stems from its capital-intensive business model, which requires Hilton Grand Vacations to make large cash investments in working capital and capital expenditures. Hilton Grand Vacations Free Cash Flow Margin Hilton Grand Vacations\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $59 million in Q3, equivalent to a 4.5% margin. The company\u2019s cash profitability regressed as it was 20.7 percentage points lower than in the same quarter last year, prompting us to pay closer attention. Short-term fluctuations typically aren\u2019t a big deal because investment needs can be seasonal, but we\u2019ll be watching to see if the trend extrapolates into future quarters. Key Takeaways from Hilton Grand Vacations\u2019s Q3 Results It was good to see Hilton Grand Vacations beat analysts\u2019 EBITDA expectations this quarter. We were also happy its revenue narrowly outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates. On the other hand, its EPS missed. Overall, this quarter could have been better. The stock traded down 2.9% to $39 immediately following the results. Hilton Grand Vacations may have had a tough quarter, but does that actually create an opportunity to invest right now? If you\u2019re making that decision, you should consider the bigger picture of valuation, business qualities, as well as the latest earnings.
