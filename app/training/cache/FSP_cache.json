Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 8:05 AM 19 min read Many Americans have long struggled to build savings. However, high inflation and interest rates since the COVID-19 pandemic have made it even more difficult for people to save for emergencies. Only around 2 in 5 (41 percent) Americans would use their savings to pay for a major unexpected expense, such as $1,000 for an emergency room visit or car repair, according to a new Bankrate poll. That\u2019s down from 44 percent a year ago. Instead of reaching for their savings, other people would pay for a $1,000 unexpected expense by financing it with a credit card they\u2019d pay off over time, reducing their spending on other things, taking out a personal loan, borrowing from family or friends or other methods. This data comes from Bankrate\u2019s yearly Emergency Savings Report, an exclusive survey-based report conducted by Bankrate and polling partner SSRS. Since 2014, the survey has annually polled 1,000+ U.S. adults about their levels of debt and emergency savings. The most recent data, polled in December 2024, specifically examines what\u2019s causing people to save less and how people would feel about affording their living expenses in case of a loss of income. In the last several years, Americans have reckoned with a number of economic headwinds, from high inflation to a slowing job market. Now, 73 percent of Americans say they\u2019re saving less for unexpected expenses due to inflation/rising prices, elevated interest rates or a change in income or employment status. It\u2019s unclear how the economy will continue to affect Americans\u2019 savings in 2025. On the positive side, inflation has slowed significantly since peaking in 2022. But the inflation rate is still above the Federal Reserve\u2019s target, leading the Federal Reserve to continue slowing the economy by keeping its federal funds rate higher for longer. What\u2019s more, economists expect the unemployment rate to reach 4.4 percent by December 2025. Bankrate\u2019s insights on emergency funds and personal savings Fewer Americans year-over-year would pay for emergencies out of savings 41% of U.S. adults would use their savings to pay for an unexpected emergency expense (such as $1,000 for an emergency room visit or car repair). This is down from 44% in 2024. Even more Americans would borrow money to pay for an emergency 43% of U.S. adults would pay for an unexpected emergency expense (such as $1,000 for an emergency room visit or car repair) by borrowing money in some form. That includes 25% of people who would use a credit card and pay it off over time, up from 21% in 2024. Americans increasingly have no savings at all 27% of U.S. adults have no emergency savings, as of May 2024 polling \u2014 the highest percentage since 2020.

This is down from 44 percent in 2024, and after three years of progress, this is the lowest the percentage has been since 2021, when it was 39 percent: Source: Bankrate Emergency Savings Surveys Note: Not all percentages total 100 due to rounding. Another 25 percent of people would use a credit card to pay for an unexpected $1,000 emergency expense and pay it off over time, up from 21 percent in 2024, and the same percentage seen in 2023. \u201cThe cost of living continues to rise, prompting more individuals and households to turn to credit cards when in a bind,\u201d Bankrate Senior Economic Analyst Mark Hamrick says. \u201cThey are a terrific tool when used wisely and effectively. But with interest rates still high, we need to avoid a deepening debt burden which could make it more challenging to save.\u201d Additionally, 13 percent of people would reduce their spending on other things to afford an unexpected $1,000 emergency expense, 13 percent would borrow from family or friends, 5 percent would take out a personal loan and 4 percent would do something else. Learn more: How to start (and build) an emergency fund Payment methods for emergency expenses, by generation Generally, the older someone is, the more likely they are to use their savings in case of an emergency. Baby boomers are the likeliest generation (59 percent) to pay for an unexpected $1,000 emergency expense from their savings, followed by Gen Xers: Baby boomers (ages 61-79): 59 percent Gen Xers (ages 45-60): 42 percent Millennials (ages 29-44): 32 percent Gen Zers (ages 18-28) : 28 percent The economy is hurting Americans\u2019 savings Though inflation is no longer rising as quickly as it did in recent years, more people this year feel the economy has affected their savings . Nearly 3 in 4 Americans (73 percent) are saving less for emergency expenses due to inflation/rising prices, elevated interest rates or a change in income or employment. This percentage is up from 68 percent in 2024. Source: Bankrate Emergency Savings Surveys Note: Not all percentages total 100 due to rounding. More than 2 in 3 Americans worry they wouldn\u2019t be able to cover their living expenses if they lost their job With unemployment expected to hit 4.4 percent by the end of 2025, the majority of Americans feel unprepared. More than 2 in 3 people (69 percent) would be very or somewhat worried they wouldn\u2019t be able to cover their immediate living expenses over the next month if they were to lose a primary source of household income tomorrow (e.g., a job loss). That includes 46 percent who would be very worried \u2014 up from 42 percent in 2024. Source: Bankrate Emergency Savings Survey, Dec. 6-9, 2024 Note: Percentages don\u2019t total 100 due to rounding. By year: We asked: If you were to lose a primary source of household income tomorrow (for example, a job loss), how worried are you that you would not have enough emergency savings to cover your immediate living expenses over the next month? Year Very/somewhat worried Not too/not at all worried 2025 69% 31% 2024 66% 34% 2023 68% 32% Source: Bankrate Emergency Savings Surveys Only 31 percent of people say they are not too worried or not at all worried. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the future of the economy might bring, but an increasing share of people are anxious about potential job loss or interruption in income,\u201d Hamrick says. \u201cBy prioritizing saving, we can be better prepared for the unexpected and attain greater financial confidence and capability.\u201d Gen Zers are likelier than other generations to say they would be very or somewhat worried about having enough emergency savings to cover their immediate living expenses if they were to lose a primary source of income tomorrow: Gen Zers: 80 percent Millennials: 72 percent Gen Xers: 72 percent Baby boomers: 58 percent The results of this data are only a few months after many Americans said their emergency savings weren\u2019t where they wanted them to be. As of September 2024 polling in a separate Bankrate Emergency Savings Survey , 62 percent of people said they felt behind where they should be on saving for emergencies, including 37 percent who felt significantly behind and 26 percent who felt slightly behind. Only around a quarter (23 percent) of people said their emergency savings are on the right track. Also, at the time, 33 percent of people said they had less emergency savings than they did at the beginning of 2024. Additionally, 17 percent of people said they had no emergency savings at the beginning of 2024 and still had none in September. As of May 2024, over 1 in 4 people have no emergency savings Keeping at least three months of expenses saved can help you weather a job loss, major unexpected bill or other sudden expense . However, as of May 2024 polling, 27 percent of U.S. adults have no emergency savings at all, the highest percentage since Bankrate asked the question in 2020. Generationally, Americans vary widely in their emergency savings levels. Over 1 in 3 (34 percent) millennials have no emergency savings, the highest percentage of any generation: Gen Zers: 29 percent Millennials: 34 percent Gen Xers: 31 percent Baby boomers: 16 percent Source: Bankrate survey, May 17-20, 2024 Note: Percentages don\u2019t total 100 due to rounding. Almost 3 in 10 (29 percent) of people have some savings, but not enough to cover three months\u2019 expenses. That percentage hasn\u2019t changed much since 2022 and 2023, when 28 percent and 30 percent of people said the same, respectively. In 2024, that percentage is far higher for some generations, specifically Gen Zers. More than 2 in 5 (44 percent) Gen Zers have some savings, but less than would cover three months of expenses, the most of any generation. Lastly, only 28 percent of people have at least six months\u2019 expenses saved, down from 30 percent in 2023. Another 16 percent of people have between three and five months\u2019 expenses saved, the lowest percentage since 2018. How to start saving now If you\u2019re one of the 27 percent of Americans with no emergency savings, know it\u2019s not too late to start. Bankrate\u2019s savings guides can show you how to begin today, even if you\u2019ve never opened a savings account before. How to start saving Nearly half (46 percent) of baby boomers have at least six months of expenses saved. Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride points out that building an emergency savings cushion doesn\u2019t happen overnight, so the years baby boomers have had to save puts them ahead compared to other generations. But even if you haven\u2019t had decades to save, it\u2019s not too late to start saving more today. \u201cTo establish an emergency savings cushion, or add to what you have, set up a direct deposit from your paycheck or an automatic transfer from your checking account into a dedicated savings account,\u201d McBride says. \u201cAutomating the savings is the key to making it happen, particularly with household budgets so tight.\u201d Level of emergency savings, by income level Without the income to funnel into savings, lower-income households are more likely to have no emergency savings than higher-income households. Nearly half (46 percent) of households with an income under $50,000 per year have no emergency savings, compared to only 7 percent of those making $100,000 per year or more: We asked: How much do you have in emergency savings \u2013 that is, money that is readily available in either a checking account, savings account, or money market? Annual income of less than $50,000 Annual income of $50,000-$74,999 Annual income of $75,000-$99.999 Annual income of $100,000 or more No emergency savings 46% 19% 7% 7% Some, but less than would cover 3 months\u2019 expenses 32% 33% 31% 22% 3 to 5 months\u2019 expenses 11% 18% 24% 21% Enough to cover 6 months\u2019 expenses or more 11% 30% 38% 50% Over half of Americans are uncomfortable with their level of emergency savings Just under 6 in 10 (59 percent) U.S. adults are uncomfortable with their emergency savings, including 32 percent who are very uncomfortable and 27 percent who are somewhat uncomfortable. On the other hand, 41 percent are comfortable with their emergency savings, including 14 percent who are very comfortable and 28 percent who are somewhat comfortable. Two-thirds (66 percent) of Gen Xers are uncomfortable with their emergency savings, the highest percentage of any generation (compared to 63 percent of Gen Zers, 60 percent of millennials and 51 percent of baby boomers: Source: Bankrate survey, May 17-20, 2024 The high percentage of people uncomfortable with their emergency savings can be attributed, in part, to rising inflation. In 2021, 48 percent of people said they were uncomfortable with their level of emergency savings. The next year, as inflation rose, the percentage jumped to 58 percent. Inflation has remained stubbornly high, and the percentage of people uncomfortable with their savings has since plateaued: 2020: 44 percent 2021: 48 percent 2022: 58 percent 2023: 57 percent 2024: 59 percent Comfort with emergency savings, by income level Higher-income households tend to be more comfortable with their emergency savings than lower-income households. More than half (56 percent) of households with an income of $100,000 per year or higher say they\u2019re comfortable: $100,000 per year or more: 56 percent $75,000-$99,999: 48 percent $50,000-$74,999: 45 percent Less than $50,000 per year: 30 percent Majority needs at least 3 months of expenses saved to feel comfortable The majority (89 percent) of Americans say they would need at least three months of expenses saved in order to feel comfortable. Moreso, 63 percent would need to have at least six months of expenses saved to feel comfortable and 26 percent would need between three and five months of expenses saved. Most generations roughly agree they would need at least three months of expenses saved to feel comfortable. However, 72 percent of baby boomers and 70 percent of Gen Xers would need at least six months of expenses saved, higher percentages compared to younger generations: Source: Bankrate survey, May 17-20, 2024 Amount of savings versus comfort with savings People who have at least three months\u2019 worth of emergency savings tend to be most comfortable with their amount of savings. Nearly three-quarters (72 percent) of U.S. adults comfortable with their emergency savings have enough to cover at least three months of expenses. Specifically, 52 percent of people comfortable with their level of emergency savings have at least six months of expenses saved. On the other hand, 40 percent of people who are uncomfortable with their emergency savings have no emergency savings and 36 percent have something saved, but less than three months of expenses. As of January 2024, more than 1 in 3 Americans have more credit card debt than emergency savings More than 1 in 3 (36 percent) U.S. adults had more credit card debt than money saved in an emergency savings account in both 2023 and 2024. But, the majority (55 percent) of U.S. adults had more emergency savings than credit card debt in 2024. That\u2019s up from 51 percent in 2023 and is the highest percentage since 2018. Additionally, 10 percent of Americans had no credit card debt or emergency savings at all, the lowest percentage in the poll\u2019s 14-year history: Note: Not all percentages total 100 due to rounding. Source: Bankrate survey, January 19-21, 2024 Millennials and Gen Xers were more likely than other generations to have more credit card debt than emergency savings: Gen Zers: 32 percent Millennials: 46 percent Gen Xers: 47 percent Baby boomers: 24 percent Average credit card rates , as of December 2024, are at 20.27 percent. If you\u2019re carrying a credit card balance, you may end up paying a great deal of money in interest. \u201cFinancing purchases at 20 percent interest rates is a sign of the financial strain millions of households are feeling,\u201d McBride says. Percentage of people who have more credit card debt than emergency savings, by gender and income Women are more likely than men to have more credit card debt than emergency savings, or to have neither: We asked: Thinking about the amount of credit card debt you now have and the money you have in your emergency fund or savings account, which is higher? Gender Credit card debt Emergency savings No credit card debt and no emergency savings Women 40% 48% 12% Men 31% 62% 8% Additionally, the likelihood of having more emergency savings than credit card debt rises with income: We asked: Thinking about the amount of credit card debt you now have and the money you have in your emergency fund or savings account, which is higher? Year income Credit card debt Emergency savings No credit card debt and no emergency savings Less than $50,000 42% 40% 18% $50,000-$74,999 39% 57% 4% $75,000-$99,999 38% 59% 4% $100,000 or more 21% 78% 1% Americans want to improve both their debt and savings Regardless of their financial situation, more people in 2024 said they wanted to tackle both debt and savings , compared to 2023: 36 percent of U.S. adults said they\u2019re prioritizing both paying down debt and increasing emergency savings. It\u2019s the highest percentage in seven years, and up slightly from 2023, when 34 percent of people said the same. When picking between the two, more people said they were prioritizing emergency savings. Around 1 in 4 (28 percent) people were prioritizing boosting emergency savings, but that\u2019s the lowest percentage yet in Bankrate\u2019s polling. Another 25 percent were prioritizing paying down debt, up from 23 percent in 2023: Note: Not all percentages total 100 due to rounding. Source: Bankrate survey, Jan. 19-21, 2024 \u201cRecognizing that the cost of carrying debt has increased significantly in the past two years and the insufficient level of emergency savings, more Americans are focusing on both paying down debt and boosting emergency savings simultaneously, rather than one to the exclusion of the other.\u201d McBride says. \u201cHaving a direct deposit from your paycheck into a dedicated savings account automates the savings, allowing you to channel your take home pay toward the goal of paying down debt.\u201d All generations were more likely to prioritize both on paying down debt and increasing emergency savings, rather than only focusing on one. Notably, 43 percent of millennials are prioritizing paying both at the same time, while 22 percent are only paying down debt and 29 percent are only increasing emergency savings. In 2024, nearly 1 in 3 people had more emergency savings than they had in 2023 In 2024, almost a third (30 percent) of U.S. adults said they have more emergency savings now than they had a year ago, the highest percentage in Bankrate\u2019s polling since 2020.

Source: Bankrate survey, Jan. 19-21, 2024 3 tips on building your emergency fund amidst high inflation Building an emergency fund can be a lifeline if your income decreases or you lose your job. Here are three tips on how to start and maintain an emergency fund to prepare for uncertainty. 1. Figure out how much you need in emergency savings Experts commonly recommend saving three to six months of expenses in case of emergencies. For example, if your monthly bills total $2,000 a month, saving $6,000 will allow you to pay your bills for a short time if you lose your main source of income. This is not a concrete rule; you may need to save more if you are self-employed and anticipate a lean month, or if you are preparing for a major lifestyle change, like an upcoming move or a new baby. 2. Open a savings account just for emergencies Different emergency funds allow you to protect your savings and allow you quick access when you need the money. An online savings account, money market account, money market mutual fund or a separate savings account with your existing bank or credit union can allow you to save emergency funds for the future. \u201cAn action item for this new year should be to prioritize financial well-being,\u201d Hamrick says. \u201cAt the top of list, use direct deposit for a dedicated emergency fund. By choosing a high-yield insured savings account, your money will be working for you and accessible when needed.\u201d 3. Make a budget around savings You may already have a budget in place to make room for saving more, but make sure you stick to your good habits. Rebuilding your savings , or starting to save for the first time, can be easier by automatically transferring money to your savings each month or taking on side hustles for more income.

Its success sets a new standard for flexible spectrum transport and future high-capacity networking innovation. \"This new service demonstrates how ultra-high bandwidth backhaul, underpinned by flexible spectrum, can transform inter-capital connectivity for critical cloud applications and high-bandwidth tasks,\" said Nic Tippelt, CTO of Titan Telecoms. \"It\u2019s a step forward in enhancing Australia\u2019s digital infrastructure and delivering better services to Australian carriers. We\u2019re excited to be able to deliver 800Gbit/s circuits over infrastructure that traditionally had not supported such high bandwidth.\" The new service transports 800Gbit/s services over a 963km flexgrid ROADM network between data centers in Sydney and Melbourne, operating over Lumea\u2019s optical ground wire network. Using the Adtran FSP 3000 TeraFlex \u2122 CoreChannel \u2122 , the service applies adaptive symbol rate and spectral shaping capabilities, optimizing optical paths and reducing costs. The open technology interoperated with Ciena\u2019s OLS to enable highly adaptive ultra-high-capacity bandwidth. Managed by Adtran\u2019s Mosaic Network Controller with SDN control, the solution improves efficiency through dynamic resource allocation. \"Spectrum services will be key to meeting the escalating demand for high-speed internet and data services. The adaptive baud rate capability of our FSP 3000 TeraFlex \u2122 technology allows for dynamic adjustment, optimizing spectrum use and extending the reach of optical networks. Designed to inject more capacity into legacy infrastructure, TeraFlex \u2122 supports 800Gbit/s transport over long distances. It offers excellent client flexibility and efficiency, accommodating a mix of 400Gbit/s, 100Gbit/s and 10Gbit/s client services and multiplexing them to 800Gbit/s to minimize cost per Gbit per kilometer,\" commented Christoph Glingener, CTO of Adtran. \"What\u2019s more, our transmitter\u2019s superior signal-to-noise ratio and receiver\u2019s high noise tolerance help ensure compatibility with existing infrastructure, enabling long transmission distances and facilitating seamless upgrades without major overhauls.\" Story Continues About Adtran ADTRAN Holdings, Inc.

Preliminary Full Year 2024 Revenue Results Cytek Biosciences, Inc. Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 4:00 PM 7 min read In This Article: CTKB +4.66% Cytek Biosciences, Inc. FREMONT, Calif., Jan. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cytek Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: CTKB), a leading cell analysis solutions company, today announced preliminary, unaudited revenue results for the full year ended December 31, 2024. Cytek expects its full year revenue for 2024 to be between $200 million and $201 million, representing 4% growth over Cytek\u2019s 2023 revenue of $193.0 million. This included a negative foreign exchange impact of approximately $1.0 million. Expected fourth quarter revenue of $57 million to $58 million represents growth of 11% to 13% compared to the third quarter of 2024 and decline of 2% to flat compared to a strong fourth quarter of 2023. The appreciation of the US dollar negatively affected fourth quarter revenue by approximately $1.5 million. \u201cOur fourth quarter revenue was significantly higher than the prior quarters of 2024, consistent with our historical pattern, although it was slightly below expectations due to the impact of the appreciation of the US dollar against other currencies in which we do business, and order delays in some markets. Our revenue in Asia Pacific and Rest of World markets grew strongly,\u201d said Dr. Wenbin Jiang, CEO of Cytek Biosciences. \u201cDespite these headwinds, we remain confident in Cytek\u2019s long-term potential and business strategy. There is a large and growing opportunity for our advanced cell analysis tools, and with strong execution across our portfolio, we are well positioned to deliver sustainable growth and profitability.\u201d The preliminary financial results in this press release are not a comprehensive statement of Cytek\u2019s financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2024, and have not been audited, reviewed or compiled by its independent registered public accounting firm. Cytek\u2019s actual revenue may differ from the estimate due to the completion of the Company\u2019s year-end closing and auditing procedures and is therefore subject to adjustment. Cytek plans to report financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2024, and to provide 2025 financial guidance during its earnings call expected to be held near the end of February 2025. J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference Cytek will present and participate in a Q&A session at the 43 rd Annual\u00a0J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, CA on January 16, 2025, at 8:15 a.m. Pacific time. Interested parties may access a live and archived webcast of the presentation on the \u201cInvestors\u201d section of the company website at: investors.cytekbio.com.
