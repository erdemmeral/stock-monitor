About Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Acurx Pharmaceuticals is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a new class of small molecule antibiotics for difficult-to-treat bacterial infections. The Company's approach is to develop antibiotic candidates with a Gram-positive selective spectrum (GPSS\u00ae) that blocks the active site of the Gram-positive specific bacterial enzyme DNA polymerase IIIC (pol IIIC), inhibiting DNA replication and leading to Gram-positive bacterial cell death. Its R&D pipeline includes antibiotic product candidates that target Gram-positive bacteria, including Clostridioides difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin resistant Enterococcus (VRE), drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (DRSP) and B. anthracis (anthrax; a Bioterrorism Category A Threat-Level pathogen). Acurx's lead product candidate, ibezapolstat, for the treatment of C. difficile Infection is Phase 3 ready with plans in progress to begin international clinical trials this year. The Company's preclinical pipeline includes development of an oral product candidate for treatment of ABSSSI (Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections), upon which a development program for treatment of inhaled anthrax is being planned in parallel.

About Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Acurx Pharmaceuticals is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a new class of small molecule antibiotics for difficult-to-treat bacterial infections.

Trump's tariffs The Next Wave of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Seems to Be on Its Way James Van Straten Updated Tue, Jan 7, 2025, 7:41 PM 3 min read In This Article: KULR -0.96% MSTR +3.67% Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this piece owns shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Semler Scientific (SMLR). As interest in digital assets continues to rise, a new phase of corporate adoption for bitcoin (BTC) appears to be taking shape, with publicly listed firms following MicroStrategy's lead by adding BTC to their balance sheets. It all started with MicroStrategy (MSTR) adopting BTC as Treasury asset in 2020. Since then, its share price has jumped almost 2,500%. Over the years, the company has boosted its coin stash through cash, at-the-market (ATM) equity offerings, convertible debt or, more recently they said they would also use preferred stock offerings. In 2024, we saw multiple companies follow suit and adopt a bitcoin treasury strategy, such as Metaplanet (3350), Semler Scientific (SMLR), MARA Holdings (MARA), as well as many other publicly traded miners that have also achieved great success. Now more firms are joining the party. The first company emerging from the second wave is KULR Technology Group (KULR), which trades on the NYSE, announced a $21 million bitcoin purchase on Monday. This takes its total bitcoin holding to 430 BTC at an average weighted price of $98,393 per token. KULR has leveraged a combination of an ATM equity program and surplus cash to fund its purchase. Like the other pioneers of this strategy, they have adopted a BTC yield strategy, coming in at 93.7% from December 2024 to January 2025. KULR's share price has been up 847% since Nov. 19. As of Jan. 7, there also seems to be an emergence of publicly traded companies that have announced a bitcoin treasury strategy, but have yet to acquire any bitcoin. First up, Acurx Pharmaceuticals (ACXP) , trading on the Nasdaq, whose board approved a purchase of up to $1 million in bitcoin on Nov. 20. The share price has been down 35% since Nov. 19, but it is up 30% year-to-date. The same is true for Hoth Therapeutics (HOTH) , also on the Nasdaq. Its board approved a $1 million bitcoin purchase, back in Nov. 20 but there has been no acquisition yet. However, the share price is up 2% since Nov. 19. The third company to have approved a $1 million bitcoin treasury strategy is Nasdaq-listed LQR House (YHC) . On Nov. 19, the firm made the announcement that they have also accepted cryptocurrency payments and adopted a policy to retain up to $10 million of these payments in bitcoin. The share price is up 56% since Nov. 19. NYSE-listed SOS Limited (SOS) approved a $50 million purchase of bitcoin on Nov. 27. The announcement was made when bitcoin was $93,000 a token. The share price has been down 30% since Nov. 19. Story Continues The last company, also on the Nasdaq, Enlivex Therapeutics (ENLV) , announced on Nov. 20 that it was approved to purchase $1 million of bitcoin for its treasury strategy. The share price has been up 18% since Nov. 19. In the second wave, KULR has seen massive share price appreciation compared to the other companies, which can be down to purchasing bitcoin along with the strategy announcement. UPDATE (Jan. 7, 16:33 UTC):\u00a0Updates: adds Enlivex Therapeutics and comments about adopting a bitcoin treasury strategy.

( FDA\u00a0Guidance\u00a0on\u00a0Formal\u00a0Meetings , EMA\u00a0Guidance on\u00a0Centralised\u00a0Procedure ) Acurx previously announced it had a successful End of Phase 2 Meeting achieving agreement with FDA on non-clinical and clinical Phase 3-readiness, including written positive feedback regarding acceptability of its CMC (Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls) plan and\u00a0 data package proposed to support the Phase 3 clinical program. In addition, Acurx had initiated the Scientific Advice procedure with the EMA to discuss the readiness for initiation of\u00a0 the Phase 3 clinical program in the EU. Acurx is preparing to submit requests for regulatory guidance to initiate clinical trials in the European Union, to be followed by requests to be submitted in the United Kingdom , Japan and Canada . Key elements for the two Phase 3, non-inferiority, pivotal trials were confirmed and included agreement on the protocol design, patient population, primary and secondary endpoints, and size of the registration safety database. The primary efficacy analysis will be performed using a Modified Intent-To-Treat (mITT) population. This will result in an estimated 450 subjects in the mITT population, randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either ibezapolstat or standard-of-care vancomycin, enrolled into the initial Phase 3 trial. The trial design not only allows determination of ibezapolstat's ability to achieve Clinical Cure of CDI as measured 2 days after 10 days of oral treatment, but also includes assessment of ibezapolstat's potential effect on reduction of CDI recurrence in the target population. In the event non-inferiority of ibezapolstat to vancomycin is demonstrated, further analysis will be conducted to test for superiority. About\u00a0the\u00a0Ibezapolstat Phase 2\u00a0Clinical\u00a0Trial The completed multicenter, open-label single- arm segment (Phase 2a) study was followed by a double-blind, randomized, active-controlled, non-inferiority, segment (Phase 2b ) at 28 US clinical trial sites which together comprise the Phase 2 clinical trial. ( Link to Clinicaltrials.gov/NCT042447542 ) This Phase 2 clinical trial was designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of ibezapolstat in the treatment of CDI including pharmacokinetics and microbiome changes from baseline. from study centers in the United States . In the Phase 2a trial segment,10 patients with diarrhea caused by C. difficile were treated with ibezapolstat 450 mg orally, twice daily for 10 days. All patients were followed for recurrence for 28\u00b1\u00a02 days. Per protocol, after 10 patients of the projected 20 Phase 2a patients completed treatment (100% cured infection at End of Treatment). In the Phase 2b trial segment, which was discontinued due to success, 32 patients with CDI were enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either ibezapolstat 450 mg every 12 hours or vancomycin 125 mg orally every 6 hours, in each case, for 10 days and followed for 28 \u00b1 2 days following the end of treatment for recurrence of CDI. The two treatments were identical in appearance, dosing times, and number of capsules administered to maintain the blind. The Company previously reported that the overall observed Clinical Cure rate in the combined Phase 2 trials in patients with CDI was 96% (25 out of 26 patients), based on 10 out of 10 patients (100%) in Phase 2a in the Modified Intent to Treat Population, plus 15 out of 16 (94%) patients in Phase 2b in the Per Protocol Population, who experienced Clinical Cure during treatment with ibezapolstat. Ibezapolstat was well-tolerated, with three patients each experiencing one mild adverse event assessed by the blinded investigator to be drug- related. All three events were gastrointestinal in nature and resolved without treatment. There were no drug-related treatment withdrawals or no drug-related serious adverse events, or other safety findings of concern. In the Phase 2b vancomycin control arm, 14 out of 14 patients experienced Clinical Cure. The Company is confident that based on the pooled Phase 2 ibezapolstat Clinical Cure rate of 96% and the historical vancomycin cure rate of approximately 81% (Vancocin\u00ae Prescribing Information, January 2021 ), we will demonstrate non-inferiority of ibezapolstat to vancomycin in Phase 3 trials in accordance with the applicable FDA Guidance for Industry ( October 2022 ). In the Phase 2 clinical trial (both trial segments), the Company also evaluated pharmacokinetics (PK) and microbiome changes and test for anti-recurrence microbiome properties, including the change from baseline in alpha diversity and bacterial abundance, especially overgrowth of healthy gut microbiota Actinobacteria and Firmicute phylum species during and after therapy. Phase 2a data demonstrated complete eradication of colonic C. difficile by day three of treatment with ibezapolstat as well as the observed overgrowth of healthy gut microbiota, Actinobacteria and Firmicute phyla species, during and after therapy. Very importantly, emerging data show an increased concentration of secondary bile acids during and following ibezapolstat therapy which is known to correlate with colonization resistance against C. difficile. A decrease in primary bile acids and the favorable increase in the ratio of secondary-to-primary bile acids suggest that ibezapolstat may reduce the likelihood of CDI recurrence when compared to vancomycin. The company also recently reported positive extended clinical cure (ECC) data for ibezapolstat (IBZ), its lead antibiotic candidate, from the Company's recently completed Phase 2b clinical trial in patients with CDI. This exploratory endpoint showed that 12 patients who agreed to be followed up to three months following Clinical Cure of their infection, 5 of 5 IBZ patients experienced no recurrence of infection. In the vancomycin control arm of the trial, 7 of 7 patients experienced no recurrence of infection. ECC success is defined as a clinical cure at the TOC visit (i.e., at least 48 hours post EOT) and no recurrence of CDI within the 56 \u00b1 2 days post EOT (ECC56) and 84 \u00b1 2 days post EOT (ECC84) in patients who consented to extended observation. In the Phase 2b trial, 100% (5 of 5) of ibezapolstat-treated patients who agreed to observation for up to three months following Clinical Cure of CDI experienced no recurrence of infection. Furthermore, ibezapolstat-treated patients showed lower concentrations of fecal primary bile acids, and higher beneficial ratio of secondary to primary bile acids than vancomycin-treated patients. About\u00a0Ibezapolstat Ibezapolstat is the Company's lead antibiotic candidate planning to advance to international Phase 3 clinical trials to treat patients with C.\u00a0diffici le Infection (CDI). Ibezapolstat is a novel, orally administered antibiotic, being developed as a Gram-Positive Selective Spectrum (GPSS\u00ae) antibacterial. It is the first of a new class of DNA polymerase IIIC inhibitors under development\u00a0by\u00a0Acurx to treat bacterial infections. Ibezapolstat's\u00a0unique spectrum of\u00a0activity, which\u00a0includes C.\u00a0difficile but spares\u00a0other\u00a0Firmicutes\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0important Actinobacteria\u00a0phyla, appears to contribute to the maintenance of a healthy gut microbiome. In June 2018 , ibezapolstat was designated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) for the treatment of patients with CDI and will be eligible to benefit from the incentives for the development of new\u00a0antibiotics\u00a0established\u00a0under\u00a0the\u00a0Generating\u00a0New\u00a0Antibiotic\u00a0Incentives\u00a0Now\u00a0(GAIN)\u00a0Act.\u00a0In\u00a0January 2019, FDA granted \"Fast Track\" designation to ibezapolstat for the treatment of patients with CDI. The CDC has designated C. difficile as an urgent threat highlighting the need for new antibiotics to treat CDI. About Clostridioides\u00a0difficile Infection\u00a0(CDI) According to the 2017 Update (published February 2018 ) of the Clinical Practice Guidelines for C. difficile Infection by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society or Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), CDI remains a significant medical problem in hospitals, in long-term care facilities and in the community. C. difficile is one of the most common causes of health care- associated infections in U.S. hospitals (Lessa, et al, 2015, New England Journal of Medicine). Recent estimates suggest C. difficile approaches 500,000 infections annually in the U.S. and is associated with approximately 20,000 deaths annually. (Guh, 2020, New England Journal of Medicine). Based on internal estimates, the recurrence rate for the antibiotics currently used to treat CDI is between 20% and 40% among approximately 150,000 patients treated. We believe the annual incidence of CDI in the U.S. approaches 600,000 infections and a mortality rate of approximately 9.3%. About\u00a0the\u00a0Microbiome\u00a0in\u00a0C.\u00a0difficile\u00a0Infection\u00a0(CDI) and Bile Acid Metabolism C. difficile can be a normal component of the healthy gut microbiome, but when the microbiome is thrown out of balance, the C. difficile can thrive and cause an infection. After colonization with C.\u00a0difficile , the organism produces and releases the main virulence factors, the two large clostridial toxins A (TcdA) and B (TcdB). (Kachrimanidou, Microorganisms 2020, 8, 200; doi:10.3390/microorganisms8020200.) TcdA and TcdB are exotoxins that bind to human intestinal epithelial cells and are responsible for inflammation, fluid and mucous secretion, as well as damage to the intestinal mucosa. Bile acids perform many functional roles in the GI tract, with one of the most important being maintenance of a healthy microbiome by inhibiting C. difficile growth. Primary bile acids, which are secreted by the liver into the intestines, promote germination of C. difficile spores and\u00a0thereby increase\u00a0the\u00a0risk\u00a0of\u00a0recurrent\u00a0CDI\u00a0after\u00a0successful\u00a0treatment\u00a0of\u00a0an\u00a0initial\u00a0episode. On the other hand, secondary bile acids, which are produced by normal gut microbiota through metabolism of primary bile acids, do not induce C. difficile sporulation and therefore protect against recurrent disease. Since ibezapolstat treatment leads to minimal disruption of the gut microbiome, bacterial production of secondary bile acids continues which may contribute to an anti-recurrence effect. Beneficial effects of bile acids include a decrease in primary bile acids and an increase in secondary bile acids in patients with CDI, which was observed in the Company's Ph2a trial results and previously reported (CID, 2022). In the Ph2b trial, ibezapolstat-treated patients showed lower concentrations of fecal primary bile acids, and higher beneficial ratio of secondary to primary bile acids than vancomycin-treated patients.

latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs Here's Why Acurx Pharmaceuticals (ACXP) Is a Great 'Buy the Bottom' Stock Now Zacks Equity Research Thu, Nov 28, 2024, 5:55 PM 3 min read In This Article: ACXP -0.07% Shares of Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ACXP) have been struggling lately and have lost 17.6% over the past week. However, a hammer chart pattern was formed in its last trading session, which could mean that the stock found support with bulls being able to counteract the bears. So, it could witness a trend reversal down the road. The formation of a hammer pattern is considered a technical indication of nearing a bottom with likely subsiding of selling pressure. But this is not the only factor that makes a bullish case for the stock. On the fundamental side, strong agreement among Wall Street analysts in raising earnings estimates for this company enhances its prospects of a trend reversal. What is a Hammer Chart and How to Trade It? This is one of the popular price patterns in candlestick charting. A minor difference between the opening and closing prices forms a small candle body, and a higher difference between the low of the day and the open or close forms a long lower wick (or vertical line). The length of the lower wick being at least twice the length of the real body, the candle resembles a 'hammer.' In simple terms, during a downtrend, with bears having absolute control, a stock usually opens lower compared to the previous day's close, and again closes lower. On the day the hammer pattern is formed, maintaining the downtrend, the stock makes a new low. However, after eventually finding support at the low of the day, some amount of buying interest emerges, pushing the stock up to close the session near or slightly above its opening price. When it occurs at the bottom of a downtrend, this pattern signals that the bears might have lost control over the price. And, the success of bulls in stopping the price from falling further indicates a potential trend reversal. Hammer candles can occur on any timeframe -- such as one-minute, daily, weekly -- and are utilized by both short-term as well as long-term investors. Like every technical indicator, the hammer chart pattern has its limitations. Particularly, as the strength of a hammer depends on its placement on the chart, it should always be used in conjunction with other bullish indicators. Here's What Makes the Trend Reversal More Likely for ACXP There has been an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions for ACXP lately, which can certainly be considered a bullish indicator on the fundamental side. That's because a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for the current year has increased 9.2%. What it means is that the sell-side analysts covering ACXP are majorly in agreement that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier. Story Continues If this is not enough, you should note that ACXP currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. And stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 usually outperform the market. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> Moreover, a Zacks Rank of 2 for Acurx Pharmaceuticals is a more conclusive indication of a potential trend reversal, as the Zacks Rank has proven to be an excellent timing indicator that helps investors identify precisely when a company's prospects are beginning to improve.

The Company's approach is to develop antibiotic candidates with a Gram-positive selective spectrum (GPSS\u00ae) that blocks the active site of the Gram+ specific bacterial enzyme DNA polymerase IIIC (pol IIIC), inhibiting DNA replication and leading to Gram-positive bacterial cell death. Its R&D pipeline includes antibiotic product candidates that target Gram-positive bacteria, including Clostridioides difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin resistant Enterococcus (VRE), drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (DRSP) and B. anthracis (anthrax; a Bioterrorism Category A Threat-Level pathogen). Acurx's lead product candidate, ibezapolstat, for the treatment of C. difficile Infection is Phase 3 ready with plans in progress to begin international clinical trials next year. The Company's preclinical pipeline includes development of an oral product candidate for treatment of Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections, upon which a development program for treatment of inhaled anthrax is being planned in parallel.

Positive Points Acurx Pharmaceuticals Inc ( NASDAQ:ACXP ) presented positive results from their phase two clinical trial for C. diff infection, indicating strong clinical efficacy. The company received a new patent for their treatment, Ibezapolstat, which could provide a competitive advantage until 2042. Acurx Pharmaceuticals Inc ( NASDAQ:ACXP ) achieved CMC readiness for phase three trials, indicating regulatory progress. The company is exploring international regulatory pathways, starting with the European Medicines Agency, to expand market reach. Acurx Pharmaceuticals Inc ( NASDAQ:ACXP ) is actively pursuing non-dilutive funding options, including government partnerships and territorial licenses, to support phase three trials. Negative Points The company reported a decrease in cash reserves, from $7.5 million at the end of 2023 to $5.8 million by September 2024. Acurx Pharmaceuticals Inc ( NASDAQ:ACXP ) experienced a net loss of $2.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, indicating ongoing financial challenges. Research and development expenses increased over the nine months ending September 2024, reflecting higher manufacturing costs. General and administrative expenses rose by $1.3 million over the same period, driven by increased professional and legal fees. The company has not yet secured a major pharmaceutical partnership, which could delay funding and progress for phase three trials. Q & A Highlights Q : Can you discuss more about the predictive model mentioned earlier as a potential diagnostic tool? A : David Luci, CEO, explained that the predictive model involves proprietary measurements of stool samples that can indicate, by the third day of treatment, whether a patient is likely to experience reinfection. This model could potentially be used as a diagnostic tool to reduce the cost burden of recurrent C. difficile infections by allowing physicians to adjust treatments early. Story Continues Q : What are the details of the international regulatory filing initiatives for ibezapolstat? A : David Luci, CEO, stated that they are starting with the European Medicines Agency, aiming for a meeting by the end of the year or early next year to set the regulatory pathway for approval. This follows the completion of FDA regulatory processes. Subsequent filings will be pursued in the UK, Canada, and Japan. Q : What are the funding options for the phase three trials, and which do you prefer? A : David Luci, CEO, prefers non-dilutive funding options, including government partnerships and territorial licenses. They are in discussions with several companies in Europe, Japan, and South America. The company also had a tech watch meeting with government officials to explore funding opportunities. Q : Can you provide insights on the phase three program's timeline and design? A : Robert Shawah, CFO, mentioned that the phase three program consists of two international registration trials with 450 patients each, randomized against oral vancomycin. The trials will have the same endpoints as the phase two B trial. The company has flexibility in conducting the trials sequentially due to regulatory exclusivity. Q : What is the current status of the ACX-375 anthrax bioterrorism program? A : David Luci, CEO, stated that the program is in preclinical stages, with laboratory and animal studies planned. The program has shown promising data against anthrax, a bioterrorism pathogen, and they are exploring potential government contracts for stockpiling.

Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results and Provides Business Update PR Newswire Wed, Nov 13, 2024, 3:00 PM 10 min read In This Article: ACXP -0.07% STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. , Nov. 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ACXP) (\"we\" or \"Acurx\" or the \"Company\"), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a new class of antibiotics for difficult-to-treat bacterial infections, announced today certain financial and operational results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 . Highlights of the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 , or in some cases shortly thereafter, include: In July 2024 , results from the ibezapolstat (IBZ) Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with C. difficile Infection (CDI) were presented at the 17th Biennial Congress of the Anaerobe Society of the Americas by Taryn A. Eubank , PharmD, BCIDP, Research Assistant Professor, University of Houston College of Pharmacy delivered an oral presentation entitled: \"Clinical Efficacy of Ibezapolstat in CDI: Results from Phase 2 trials.\" Also in July 2024 , and very timely given our late-stage development progress, the USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office) granted Acurx a new patent for ibezapolstat which specifically encompasses the \"treatment of C. difficile Infection while reducing recurrence of infection and improving the health of the gut microbiome\". This patent expires in June 2042 and we believe will provide an important downstream competitive advantage. In August 2024 , we submitted our request to FDA for a meeting to review our manufacturing processes and specifications for drug substance and final product and packaging (a \"CMC Meeting\") in order to commence Phase 3 clinical trials. This FDA submission is customary and follows our successful End of Ph2 clinical meeting with FDA which confirmed our Ph3 clinical trial readiness. We anticipate convening a meeting with FDA regarding\u00a0CMC in the fourth quarter. In September 2024 , a presentation was given by Executive Chairman, Bob DeLuccia , at the World Antimicrobial Resistance Scientific Congress held in Philadelphia . In his presentation at the Innovation Showcase session, he highlighted that we have a complete roadmap, not only for the required components of our phase 3 clinical program, but also what's required for ultimate filing of an NDA (or New Drug Application) which is to be followed by submissions for Marketing Authorizations in other countries around the world. He also presented an update on the Company's preclinical GPSS\u00ae (Gram Positive Selective Spectrum) program for systemic oral and IV treatment of other gram-positive infections including, MRSA, VRE and DRSP. Also in September 2024 , we participated at the 8th Annual C. Difficile Symposium (or ICDS) in Bled, Slovenia , which is the premier global scientific venue for the review of C. Difficile research. At the ICDS Meeting, two presentations were made on behalf of the Company. Additionally in September 2024 , we announced that selected ACX-375 DNA pol IIIC analogues demonstrated in vitro activity against B. anthracis (or Anthrax), which is a Bioterrorism Category A pathogen, including activity against ciprofloxacin-resistant Anthrax. This work was performed at two independent qualified laboratories including the University of Florida . Planning is underway for an Anthrax bioterrorism development program. In October 2024 , we participated at IDWeek in Los Angeles , the annual scientific conference of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Drs. Kevin Garey and Taryn Eubank presented a scientific poster showing that in the Phase 2b clinical trial, ibezapolstat had comparable clinical cure and sustained clinical cure rates and safety profile to vancomycin. Also, 5 of 5 ibezapolstat patients who were followed for 3 months after end of treatment (EOT) experienced no recurrence. Ibezapolstat-treated patients showed decreased concentrations of fecal primary bile acids, and higher ratios of secondary to primary bile acids than vancomycin-treated patients. International regulatory filing initiatives will continue in Q4 2024. Story Continues Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results Cash Position : The Company ended the quarter with cash totaling $5.8 million , compared to $7.5 million as of December 31, 2023 . During the third quarter, the Company raised additional proceeds under its ATM financing program, with gross proceeds of approximately $1.6 million . R&D Expenses : Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $1.2 million compared to $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease was due primarily to an increase in manufacturing related costs during the quarter of $0.1 million , offset by a reduction in consulting fees of $0.2 million . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 research & development expenses were $4.6 million compared to $4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , an increase of $0.5 million primarily due to $0.9 million increase in manufacturing related costs, offset by $0.4 million decrease in consulting fees. G&A Expenses : General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $1.6 million compared to $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 , a decrease of $0.2 million . The decrease was primarily due to $0.2 million increase in professional fees, a $0.1 million increase in compensation costs, offset by a $0.5 million decrease in non cash share-based compensation related costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , general and administrative expenses were $6.7 million compared to $5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , an increase of $1.3 million . The increase was primarily due to $1.1 million increase in professional fees and a $0.2 million increase in legal costs. Net Income/Loss : The Company reported a net loss of $2.8 million or $0.17 per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss of $3.1 million or $0.24 per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2023 , and a net loss of $11.3 million or $0.71 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to a net loss of $9.5 million or $0.77 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 for the reasons previously mentioned. The Company had 16,770,378 shares outstanding as of September 30, 2024 . Conference Call As previously announced, David P. Luci , President and Chief Executive Officer, and Robert G. Shawah , Chief Financial Officer, will host a conference call to discuss the results and provide a business update as follows: Date: Wednesday, November 13, 2024 Time: 8:00 a.m. ET Toll free (U.S. and International): 877-790-1503 Conference ID: 13749688 About Ibezapolstat Ibezapolstat is the Company's lead antibiotic candidate preparing to advance to international Phase 3 clinical trials to treat patients with C. difficile Infection (CDI). Ibezapolstat is a novel, orally administered antibiotic being developed as a Gram-Positive Selective Spectrum (GPSS \u00ae ) antibacterial. It is the first of a new class of DNA polymerase IIIC inhibitors under development by Acurx to treat bacterial infections. Ibezapolstat's unique spectrum of activity, which includes C. difficile but spares other Firmicutes and the important Actinobacteria phyla, appears to contribute to the maintenance of a healthy gut microbiome. In June 2018 , ibezapolstat was designated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) for the treatment of patients with CDI and will be eligible to benefit from the incentives for the development of new antibiotics established under the Generating New Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) Act. In January 2019 , FDA granted \"Fast Track\" designation to ibezapolstat for the treatment of patients with CDI. The CDC has designated C. difficile as an urgent threat highlighting the need for new antibiotics to treat CDI. About Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Acurx Pharmaceuticals is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a new class of small molecule antibiotics for difficult-to-treat bacterial infections. The Company's approach is to develop antibiotic candidates with a Gram-positive selective spectrum (GPSS\u00ae) that blocks the active site of the Gram+ specific bacterial enzyme DNA polymerase IIIC (pol IIIC), inhibiting DNA replication and leading to Gram-positive bacterial cell death. Its R&D pipeline includes antibiotic product candidates that target Gram-positive bacteria, including Clostridioides difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (DRSP).

(NASDAQ: ACXP) (\"Acurx\" or the \"Company\"), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a new class of small molecule antibiotics for difficult-to-treat bacterial infections, with\u00a0its\u00a0lead\u00a0antibiotic\u00a0candidate,\u00a0ibezapolstat, preparing to advance to international Phase 3 clinical trials to treat patients with C.\u00a0difficile Infection\u00a0(CDI).\u00a0The\u00a0Company\u00a0today\u00a0announced updates on Phase 3 Readiness for Ibezapolstat in C. difficile Infection based on recent FDA and EMA Communications. Written communications are used by both regulatory agencies in lieu of face-to-face or teleconference/video conferences when these agencies determine that a written response to the sponsor's questions would be the most appropriate means for providing feedback and advice to the sponsor. ( FDA Guidance on Formal Meetings , EMA Guidance on Centralised Procedure ) Acurx's\u00a0Executive\u00a0Chairman,\u00a0Bob\u00a0DeLuccia,\u00a0stated: \"We are very pleased with these latest favorable communications from both regulatory agencies and in our opinion are a testament to the strength of our clinical data to date, our robust regulatory submissions, and adherence to current regulatory guidance.\" He further added: \"We anticipate, and are confident, that with final EMA advice for our ibezapolstat Phase 3 trials for adult patients with CDI and the pediatric development plans from both regulatory agencies, Acurx will have a clear international roadmap for conduct of our Phase 3 program and, if successful, requirements for US NDA submission and EU Marketing Authorization.\" Story Continues Acurx has previously announced that it had a successful FDA End-of-Phase 2 Meeting and Phase 3 Readiness for ibezapolstat\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0Treatment of C.\u00a0difficile Infection.\u00a0Agreement with FDA was reached on key elements to move forward with its international Phase 3 clinical\u00a0trial program. Agreement was also reached with FDA on the complete non-clinical and clinical development plan for filing of a New Drug Application (NDA) for marketing approval. Planning continues to advance ibezapolstat into international Phase 3 clinical trials for treatment of C. difficile Infection (CDI). Acurx is also preparing to submit requests for regulatory guidance to initiate clinical trials in the European Union, to be followed by\u00a0requests to be submitted in the United Kingdom , Japan and Canada . Key elements for the two Phase 3, non-inferiority, pivotal trials were confirmed and included agreement on the protocol design, patient population, primary and secondary endpoints, and size of the registration safety database. Based on FDA recommendations, and in anticipation of an\u00a0EMA Scientific Advice Meeting, the primary efficacy analysis will be performed using a Modified Intent-To-reat (mITT)\u00a0population\u00a0consistent\u00a0with\u00a0EMA\u00a0requirements.\u00a0This\u00a0will\u00a0result in an estimated 450 subjects in the mITT population, randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either ibezapolstat or standard-of-care vancomycin, enrolled into the initial Phase 3 trial. The trial design not only allows determination of ibezapolstat's ability to achieve Clinical Cure of CDI as measured 2 days after 10 days of oral treatment, but also includes assessment of ibezapolstat's potential effect on reduction of CDI recurrence in the target population. In the event non-inferiority of ibezapolstat to vancomycin is demonstrated, further analysis will be conducted to test for superiority. About\u00a0the\u00a0Ibezapolstat Phase 2\u00a0Clinical\u00a0Trial The completed\u00a0multicenter,\u00a0open-label\u00a0single- arm\u00a0segment\u00a0(Phase\u00a02a)\u00a0study\u00a0was\u00a0followed by\u00a0a\u00a0double-blind,\u00a0randomized,\u00a0active-controlled,\u00a0non-inferiority,\u00a0segment (Phase\u00a02b) at 28 US clinical trial sites which together comprise the Phase 2 clinical trial. ( Link to Clinicaltrials.gov/NCT042447542 ) This Phase 2 clinical trial was designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of\u00a0ibezapolstat in the treatment of CDI including pharmacokinetics\u00a0and microbiome\u00a0changes from\u00a0baseline.\u00a0from\u00a0study\u00a0centers in\u00a0the\u00a0United States. In the Phase 2a trial segment,10 patients with diarrhea caused by C. difficile were treated with ibezapolstat\u00a0450 mg orally, twice daily for 10 days. All patients were followed for recurrence for 28\u00b1 2 days. Per protocol, after 10 patients of the projected 20 Phase 2a patients completed treatment (100% cured infection at End of Treatment). In\u00a0the\u00a0Phase\u00a02b\u00a0trial\u00a0segment, which\u00a0was\u00a0discontinued\u00a0due\u00a0to\u00a0success, 32\u00a0patients\u00a0with\u00a0CDI were enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either ibezapolstat 450 mg every 12 hours or vancomycin 125 mg orally every 6 hours, in each case, for 10 days and followed for 28 \u00b1 2 days following the end of treatment for recurrence of CDI. The two treatments were identical in appearance, dosing times, and number of capsules administered to maintain the blind. The Company previously reported that the overall observed Clinical Cure rate in the combined Phase 2 trials in patients with CDI was 96% (25 out of 26 patients), based on 10 out of 10 patients (100%) in Phase 2a in the Modified Intent to Treat Population, plus 15 out of 16 (94%) patients in Phase 2b in the Per Protocol Population, who experienced Clinical Cure during treatment with ibezapolstat.\u00a0Ibezapolstat\u00a0was\u00a0well-tolerated,\u00a0with\u00a0three\u00a0patients each experiencing one mild adverse event assessed by the blinded investigator to be drug- related. All three events were gastrointestinal in nature and resolved without treatment. There were no drug-related treatment withdrawals or no drug-related serious adverse events, or other safety findings of concern. In the Phase 2b vancomycin\u00a0control\u00a0arm,\u00a014\u00a0out of 14 patients experienced Clinical Cure. The Company is confident that based on the pooled Phase 2 ibezapolstat Clinical Cure rate of 96% and the historical vancomycin cure rate of approximately 81% (Vancocin\u00ae Prescribing Information, January 2021 ), we will demonstrate non-inferiority of ibezapolstat to vancomycin in Phase 3 trials in accordance with the applicable FDA Guidance for Industry ( October 2022 ). In the Phase 2 clinical trial (both trial segments), the Company also evaluated pharmacokinetics (PK) and microbiome changes and test for anti-recurrence microbiome properties, including the change from baseline in alpha diversity and bacterial abundance, especially overgrowth of healthy gut microbiota\u00a0Actinobacteria\u00a0and\u00a0Firmicute\u00a0phylum\u00a0species during and after therapy. Phase 2a data demonstrated complete eradication of colonic C. difficile by day three of treatment with ibezapolstat as well as the observed overgrowth of healthy gut microbiota, Actinobacteria and Firmicute phyla species, during and after therapy. Very importantly, emerging data show an increased concentration of secondary bile acids during and following ibezapolstat therapy which is known to correlate with colonization resistance against C. difficile. A decrease in primary bile acids and the favorable increase in the ratio of secondary-to-primary bile acids suggest that ibezapolstat may reduce the likelihood of CDI recurrence when compared to vancomycin. The company also recently reported positive extended clinical cure (ECC) data for ibezapolstat (IBZ), its lead antibiotic candidate, from the Company's recently completed Phase 2b clinical trial in patients with CDI. This exploratory endpoint showed that 12 patients who agreed to be followed up to three months following Clinical Cure of their infection, 5 of 5 IBZ patients experienced no recurrence of infection. In the vancomycin\u00a0control arm of the trial, 7 of 7 patients experienced no recurrence of infection.\u00a0ECC success is defined as a clinical cure at the TOC visit (i.e., at least 48 hours post EOT) and no recurrence of CDI within the 56 \u00b1 2 days post EOT (ECC56) and 84 \u00b1 2 days post EOT (ECC84) in patients who consented to extended observation. In the Phase 2b trial, 100% (5 of 5) of ibezapolstat-treated patients who agreed to observation for up to three months following Clinical Cure of CDI experienced no recurrence of infection. Furthermore, ibezapolstat-treated patients showed lower concentrations\u00a0of\u00a0fecal\u00a0primary bile\u00a0acids,\u00a0and\u00a0higher\u00a0beneficial\u00a0ratio\u00a0of\u00a0secondary to\u00a0primary bile acids than vancomycin-treated patients. About\u00a0Ibezapolstat Ibezapolstat is the Company's lead antibiotic candidate planning to advance to international Phase 3 clinical trials to treat patients with C. diffici le Infection (CDI). Ibezapolstat is a novel, orally administered antibiotic, being developed as a Gram-Positive Selective Spectrum (GPSS\u00ae) antibacterial. It is the first of a new class of DNA polymerase IIIC inhibitors under development by Acurx\u00a0to treat bacterial infections. Ibezapolstat's\u00a0unique spectrum\u00a0of\u00a0activity, which includes C. difficile but spares other Firmicutes\u00a0and the important Actinobacteria\u00a0phyla, appears to contribute to the maintenance of a healthy gut\u00a0microbiome. In June 2018 , ibezapolstat was designated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) for the treatment of patients with CDI and will be eligible to benefit from the incentives for the development of new antibiotics established under the Generating New Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) Act. In January 2019 , FDA granted \"Fast Track\" designation to ibezapolstat\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0treatment of\u00a0patients\u00a0with CDI. The CDC has designated C. difficile as an urgent threat highlighting the need for new antibiotics to treat CDI. About Clostridioides\u00a0difficile Infection\u00a0(CDI) According to the 2017 Update (published February 2018 ) of the Clinical Practice Guidelines for C. difficile\u00a0Infection by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and\u00a0Society\u00a0or Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), CDI remains a significant medical problem in hospitals, in long-term care facilities and in the community. C. difficile is one of the most common causes of health care- associated infections in U.S. hospitals (Lessa, et al, 2015, New England Journal of Medicine). Recent estimates suggest C. difficile approaches 500,000 infections annually in the U.S. and is associated with approximately 20,000 deaths annually. (Guh, 2020, New England Journal of Medicine). Based on internal estimates, the recurrence rate for the antibiotics currently used to treat CDI is between 20% and 40% among approximately 150,000 patients treated. We believe the annual incidence of CDI in the U.S. approaches 600,000 infections and a mortality rate of approximately 9.3%. About\u00a0the\u00a0Microbiome\u00a0in C.\u00a0difficile Infection\u00a0(CDI) and Bile Acid Metabolism C. difficile can be a normal component of the healthy gut microbiome, but when the microbiome is thrown out of balance, the C. difficile can thrive and cause an infection. After colonization\u00a0with C.\u00a0difficile , the organism produces and releases the main virulence factors, the two large\u00a0clostridial toxins A (TcdA) and B (TcdB). (Kachrimanidou, Microorganisms 2020, 8, 200; doi: 0.3390/microorganisms8020200.) TcdA\u00a0and TcdB\u00a0are exotoxins\u00a0that bind to human intestinal epithelial cells and are responsible for inflammation, fluid and mucous secretion, as well as damage to the intestinal\u00a0mucosa. Bile acids perform many functional roles in the GI tract, with one of the most important being maintenance of a healthy microbiome by inhibiting C. difficile growth. Primary bile acids, which\u00a0are\u00a0secreted\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0liver\u00a0into\u00a0the\u00a0intestines,\u00a0promote germination\u00a0of C.\u00a0difficile spores and thereby increase the risk of recurrent CDI after successful treatment of an initial episode. On the other hand, secondary bile acids, which are produced by normal gut microbiota through metabolism of primary bile acids, do not induce C. difficile sporulation and therefore protect against recurrent disease. Since ibezapolstat treatment leads to minimal disruption of the gut microbiome, bacterial production of secondary bile acids continues which may contribute to an anti-recurrence effect. Beneficial effects of bile acids include a decrease in primary bile acids and an increase in secondary bile acids in patients with\u00a0CDI, which was observed in the Company's Ph2a trial results and previously reported (CID, 2022). In the Ph2b trial, ibezapolstat-treated patients showed lower concentrations of fecal primary bile acids, and higher beneficial ratio of secondary to primary bile acids than\u00a0vancomycin-treated patients. About\u00a0Acurx Pharmaceuticals,\u00a0Inc. Acurx Pharmaceuticals is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a new class of small molecule antibiotics for difficult-to-treat bacterial infections. The Company's approach is to develop antibiotic candidates with a Gram-positive selective spectrum (GPSS\u00ae) that blocks the active site of the Gram-positive specific bacterial enzyme DNA polymerase IIIC (pol IIIC), inhibiting DNA replication and leading to Gram-positive bacterial\u00a0cell\u00a0death.\u00a0Its R&D pipeline includes antibiotic product candidates that target Gram-positive bacteria, including Clostridioides difficile , methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin resistant Enterococcus (VRE), drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (DRSP) and B. anthracis (anthrax; a Bioterrorism Category A Threat-Level pathogen).\u00a0 Acurx's lead product candidate, ibezapolstat, for the treatment of C. difficile Infection is Phase 3 ready with plans in progress to begin international clinical trials next year. The Company's preclinical pipeline includes development of an oral product candidate for treatment of ABSSSI (Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections), upon which a development program for treatment of inhaled anthrax is being planned in parallel.
