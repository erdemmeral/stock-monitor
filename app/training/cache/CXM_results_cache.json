[{"text": "Customer Experience Transforms into a Revenue Powerhouse, Nextiva Survey Reveals Business Wire Tue, Jan 28, 2025, 1:00 PM 5 min read AI Investments Are Widespread; Tool Overload Stalls Progress for Many; Harmonizing AI and the Human Touch Remains a Struggle SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., January 28, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Nextiva, the leading unified customer experience management (UCXM) platform, today announced the results of its recent survey of customer experience (CX) decision-makers, providing insight into the success and challenges businesses are facing and revealing CX trends for the year ahead. The survey, which collected feedback from more than 1,000 in-house customer experience leaders across the US, UK, and Canada in November of 2024, found that CX has transitioned away from being thought of as a cost center, and is now considered a revenue driver for businesses and a leading indicator of business performance. Further survey results indicate what CX leaders and the businesses they manage are planning to do to retain and grow revenue in an increasingly competitive digital economy. For the survey, Nextiva partnered with market research firm Dimensional Research to understand the biggest challenges and opportunities faced by CX practitioners. Six clear trends emerged: 1. CX reputation rises in the c-suite and shines as a revenue generator CX is no longer just a cost center \u2014 96% of CX leaders report that company leadership sees CX as a key driver of business outcomes and 79% say their corporate leadership now view CX as a crucial revenue driver. This shifting perspective is making it easier to get CX investments approved, with 67% of respondents reporting increased ease in securing funding compared to five years ago. 2. Tech, culture and ROI have shifted CX\u2019s perception over the years Technology advances and cultural adaptations have iteratively moved CX\u2019s reputation over the years. Nearly half (47%) now cite the increased ability to track the impact of their CX investments (using metrics like CLTV, CAC, and retention rate) as a notable reason for its perception change. Additional factors cited by leaders were the ability to implement new technologies (43%), general changes in attitude across the industry (42%) and better ROI metrics (35%). 3. Tech-debt stalls CX progress as teams struggle with tool overload On average, CX teams juggle more than six different tools to interact with customers. This can make delivering consistent, personalized service a challenge. 81% of CX professionals believe consolidating customer data into a single system would improve CX. Shredding tech debt and consolidating into a single CX platform is a trend to watch as companies strive for better and more efficient customer experiences. Story Continues 4. 92% of businesses embrace AI for CX, but only 9% lead with mature adoption To truly impact customers and win in the field of CX, businesses need to embrace AI to help streamline operations and enhance customer interactions. That necessity was reflected in the survey responses, with 92% of CX leaders reporting they have adopted AI. 24% characterize themselves as \"early stage,\" 31% as \"in process\" and 28% as \"established.\" Just 9% called themselves \"mature\" in their adoption. 5. Revenue generation was the top AI investment driver, with curiosity motivating a quarter 54% of CX leaders cited revenue generation as their primary reason to invest in AI, with process improvements/efficiency gains (46%), customer demand (40%) and competitive pressure (39%) following. Demonstrating innovation (35%) and curiosity (26%) were also cited. Organizations reported a dozen different current and future use cases; using gen AI to write to customers (64%), agent assist tools (60%), self-service (57%) and quality assurance (53%) were the most common use cases. 6. AI-related CX challenges evolve with maturity: data issues drop, complexity rises Challenges shift as companies mature in their AI journey. Data issues peak among \"in-process\" companies (43%) before dropping among \"mature\" organizations (31%). \"Early stage\" companies are far less worried about the regulatory landscape than their \"mature\" counterparts (24% vs. 35%). Also common among the least mature organizations: a lack of time and resources for experimenting and learning (24%). 7. Out of kilter human-to-AI handoffs hold back nine in ten CX organizations Almost all CX decision makers (98%) say a smooth handoff between AI interactions and human agents is essential. Yet, most (90%) CX decision-makers using AI for CX report struggling to reduce friction. Employee resistance tops the list of barriers (36%), followed by customer resistance (29%). Technology issues are also a factor, with the lack of integration (29%) and legacy technology (27%) cited as issues. To resolve the hand-off issues, CX decision-makers say their company would benefit if human agents could oversee AI interactions and assist as needed (51%). \"Customer experience is recognized as a strategic investment on the c-suite agenda,\" said Tomas Gorny, CEO and co-founder of Nextiva. \"But to truly capitalize on CX as a revenue driver, businesses need to overcome tech-debt, accelerate AI adoption and focus on harmonizing AI and the human touch. The emphasis should be on simplifying operations, consolidating technologies and creating seamless, personalized experiences for customers. Companies that embrace these trends will be rewarded with the loyalty of customers whose expectations continue to rise.\" For complete survey results, see the Dimensional Research-produced report The 2025 CX Landscape , sponsored by Nextiva, at: http://get.nextiva.com/2025-cx-trends-dimensional-report .

Calculation For Sprinklr, Inc. (NYSE:CXM) Suggests It's 38% Undervalued editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 8:08 PM 6 min read In This Article: CXM -1.01% Key Insights Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Sprinklr fair value estimate is US$13.95 Current share price of US$8.63 suggests Sprinklr is potentially 38% undervalued The US$10.21 analyst price target for CXM is 27% less than our estimate of fair value Does the January share price for Sprinklr, Inc. ( NYSE:CXM ) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex. Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model . View our latest analysis for Sprinklr The Method We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$55.2m US$82.8m US$97.3m US$128.0m US$148.7m US$166.8m US$182.2m US$195.5m US$207.0m US$217.1m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x9 Analyst x10 Analyst x5 Analyst x1 Est @ 16.19% Est @ 12.12% Est @ 9.27% Est @ 7.27% Est @ 5.88% Est @ 4.90% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% US$51.6 US$72.3 US$79.4 US$97.6 US$106 US$111 US$113 US$114 US$113 US$110 (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$968m We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.6%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.0%. Story Continues Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$217m\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (7.0%\u2013 2.6%) = US$5.1b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = US$5.1b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.0%) 10 = US$2.6b The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$3.5b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$8.6, the company appears quite undervalued at a 38% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. NYSE:CXM Discounted Cash Flow January 22nd 2025 The Assumptions Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Sprinklr as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.064. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for Sprinklr Strength Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry. Currently debt free. Weakness Earnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market. Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%. Threat Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market. Looking Ahead: Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

Financial Services Stocks to Buy According to Analysts? Fatima Gulzar Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 4:56 PM 7 min read In This Article: SPGI -0.58% We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Financial Services Stocks To Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) stands against the other best financial services stocks to buy according to analysts. According to the Financial Industry Index, which increased by more than 30% by mid-December and beat the overall market by about 5 percentage points, 2024 was a spectacular year for the financial industry. This growth followed concerns about mid-sized bank collapses in early 2024, which proved to be isolated incidents rather than an issue impacting the industry as a whole. Meanwhile, as we have mentioned in our article, 10 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds , the market for financial services has expanded significantly in the last several years and is further expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7% in the next few years. Amidst the growth, as per EY\u2019s report, the financial services industry is also undergoing a change because of artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI, which boosts productivity, modifications, and innovation. AI is helping banks provide individual solutions and improve risk control while accelerating processes like fraud detection, loan processing, and customer support. Large financial institutions are using AI to lower expenses, improve compliance, and create new products like automated tax compliance and predictive analytics. Nonetheless, issues like data privacy, rules of conduct, and AI\u2019s \u201cblack box\u201d decision-making continue to exist. Notwithstanding these obstacles, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing financial services by spreading beyond banking to include wealth management, insurance, and payments. According to IBM\u2019s report 2024, Generative AI is revolutionizing financial services by improving customer satisfaction and propelling advancements in risk assessment as well as personalized financial solutions. Secondly, the use of hybrid clouds is growing as companies seek to boost compliance, scalability, and efficiency. Thirdly, cybersecurity is still crucial, with growing investment in fraud detection systems as AI-driven threats emerge. Businesses are putting a greater spotlight on sustainability by giving green financial products and ESG initiatives top priority. By utilizing AI technologies such as Watsonx Assistant, customer experience management (CXM) increases customer pleasure and loyalty. Moreover, the use of open banking is growing as a result of APIs\u2019 ability to simplify procedures and provide customers with more control over their data. Secure online transactions are being reinforced by the resurgence of digital currencies and blockchain. Story Continues Looking ahead, Deloitte\u2019s 2025 investment management outlook predicts that AI, digital transformation, and changing investor demands will quickly impact the investment management industry in 2025. Low-cost funds are dominant, with active management flourishing within ETFs. Sustainability-focused investments, hybrid funds, and private financing are important growth areas. AI has exceeded expectations and is transforming operations and sales, but companies that are not embracing it quickly could fall behind. Regulatory changes, cybersecurity, and the combination of traditional and alternative assets are examples of growing risks. While some companies may find it difficult to survive in a high-risk, high-reward environment, bold companies that use AI and diversify their products may benefit from these changes. The key to success is scaling innovation and satisfying the need for sustainable, affordable solutions. On the other hand, Deloitte\u2019s 2025 banking and capital markets outlook report stated that banks can strengthen their basis for sustainable growth with creativity and discipline as the banking industry adjusts to a low-growth, lower-rate environment. It is anticipated that GDP growth will be 1.5% in 2025, and inflation will be approaching the 2% target, presenting a low-growth, lower-rate scenario for US banks. With savings exhausted by March 2024 and debt reaching $17.7 trillion, consumer spending may decline. Net interest margins may be compressed as a result of declining interest rates, with the federal funds rate falling to 350-375 basis points. Noninterest income presents opportunities, but growing salaries and technology expenditures drive up costs. Credit quality may slightly improve but is expected to stabilize. As geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty further complicate the picture, Deloitte observes that weak business investment and higher deposit costs will test banks\u2019 adaptability. 10 Best Financial Services Stocks To Buy According to Analysts A group of analysts studying data on a large monitor. Methodology We sifted through holdings of financial ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 financial services stocks. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with a projected upside potential of over 7% based on analyst price targets, as of January 9. The stocks are ranked according to their upside potential. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Financial Services Stocks to Buy According to Analysts? Fatima Gulzar Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 7:09 PM 8 min read In This Article: SCHW +0.04% We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Financial Services Stocks To Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) stands against the other best financial services stocks to buy according to analysts. According to the Financial Industry Index, which increased by more than 30% by mid-December and beat the overall market by about 5 percentage points, 2024 was a spectacular year for the financial industry. This growth followed concerns about mid-sized bank collapses in early 2024, which proved to be isolated incidents rather than an issue impacting the industry as a whole. Meanwhile, as we have mentioned in our article, 10 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds , the market for financial services has expanded significantly in the last several years and is further expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7% in the next few years. Amidst the growth, as per EY\u2019s report, the financial services industry is also undergoing a change because of artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI, which boosts productivity, modifications, and innovation. AI is helping banks provide individual solutions and improve risk control while accelerating processes like fraud detection, loan processing, and customer support. Large financial institutions are using AI to lower expenses, improve compliance, and create new products like automated tax compliance and predictive analytics. Nonetheless, issues like data privacy, rules of conduct, and AI\u2019s \u201cblack box\u201d decision-making continue to exist. Notwithstanding these obstacles, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing financial services by spreading beyond banking to include wealth management, insurance, and payments. According to IBM\u2019s report 2024, Generative AI is revolutionizing financial services by improving customer satisfaction and propelling advancements in risk assessment as well as personalized financial solutions. Secondly, the use of hybrid clouds is growing as companies seek to boost compliance, scalability, and efficiency. Thirdly, cybersecurity is still crucial, with growing investment in fraud detection systems as AI-driven threats emerge. Businesses are putting a greater spotlight on sustainability by giving green financial products and ESG initiatives top priority. By utilizing AI technologies such as Watsonx Assistant, customer experience management (CXM) increases customer pleasure and loyalty. Moreover, the use of open banking is growing as a result of APIs\u2019 ability to simplify procedures and provide customers with more control over their data. Secure online transactions are being reinforced by the resurgence of digital currencies and blockchain. Story Continues Looking ahead, Deloitte\u2019s 2025 investment management outlook predicts that AI, digital transformation, and changing investor demands will quickly impact the investment management industry in 2025. Low-cost funds are dominant, with active management flourishing within ETFs. Sustainability-focused investments, hybrid funds, and private financing are important growth areas. AI has exceeded expectations and is transforming operations and sales, but companies that are not embracing it quickly could fall behind. Regulatory changes, cybersecurity, and the combination of traditional and alternative assets are examples of growing risks. While some companies may find it difficult to survive in a high-risk, high-reward environment, bold companies that use AI and diversify their products may benefit from these changes. The key to success is scaling innovation and satisfying the need for sustainable, affordable solutions. On the other hand, Deloitte\u2019s 2025 banking and capital markets outlook report stated that banks can strengthen their basis for sustainable growth with creativity and discipline as the banking industry adjusts to a low-growth, lower-rate environment. It is anticipated that GDP growth will be 1.5% in 2025, and inflation will be approaching the 2% target, presenting a low-growth, lower-rate scenario for US banks. With savings exhausted by March 2024 and debt reaching $17.7 trillion, consumer spending may decline. Net interest margins may be compressed as a result of declining interest rates, with the federal funds rate falling to 350-375 basis points. Noninterest income presents opportunities, but growing salaries and technology expenditures drive up costs. Credit quality may slightly improve but is expected to stabilize. As geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty further complicate the picture, Deloitte observes that weak business investment and higher deposit costs will test banks\u2019 adaptability. 10 Best Financial Services Stocks To Buy According to Analysts A corporate finance professional studying a financial performance chart. Methodology We sifted through holdings of financial ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 financial services stocks. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with a projected upside potential of over 7% based on analyst price targets, as of January 9. The stocks are ranked according to their upside potential.

( see more details here ) The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW ) Upside Potential as of January 9: 11.96% One of the Best Financial Stocks, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), a savings and loan holding company, was established in 1986 and offers a range of services, including banking, asset management, wealth management, custody, and financial advising. Investor Services and Advisor Services are its two main business segments. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) became the biggest retail broker in the US by client assets after acquiring TD Ameritrade, which strengthened its offerings for individual investors and improved trading. As of the end of July, Schwab\u2019s total customer assets stood at $9.57 trillion, a growth driven by the increase in new assets. This translates to a 2% monthly rise and a 16% annual increase. Among the monthly accomplishments were 327,000 new brokerage accounts and $29 billion in core net new assets. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) produced strong third-quarter results, with net revenues rising 5% year over year to $4.8 billion, fueled by market performance and ongoing investor engagement. The company\u2019s total client assets reached a record $9.92 trillion, up 27% year on year, thanks to solid asset acquisition and equity market resilience. The quarter\u2019s core net new assets came to $95.3 billion, increasing the year-to-date total to $252.1 billion, a 10% increase over 2023. The adjusted diluted earnings per share were stable at $0.77, while the adjusted net income was $1.5 billion. Trading revenue rose 4% year over year, while adjusted pre-tax profit margins improved to 41.2%. Along with continuing to cut back on supplemental funding, Schwab also reported sequential growth in client transactional sweep cash balances, reaching $384 billion. These outcomes highlight Schwab\u2019s solid operating momentum and careful financial management. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)\u2019s strong market position and development potential have led analysts to award the company a Buy recommendation. The average price objective indicates a possible gain of 11.96% from the current stock price of $73.00. Natixis Global Asset Management\u2019s Harris Associates was the largest stakeholder in the company among the funds in Insider Monkey\u2019s database. It owns 28.23 million shares worth $1.83 billion as of Q3. RiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q3 2024 investor letter : \u201cThe Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW): SCHW was a top detractor in the third quarter following an uneven second quarter earnings report. After two quarters of stabilization of client deposits and continued reduction of short-term high-cost funding, both metrics reversed in the second quarter causing the company to lower near term EPS expectations. Client deposit accounts, though no longer materially impacted by cash sorting (clients moving cash to higher yielding instruments), declined more than expected as clients used this cash to pay taxes. Lower than expected deposits in turn limited SCHW\u2019s ability to continue to pay down higher cost funding sources ultimately leading to lower spread income. While near term EPS expectations were lowered, we believe that 1) higher spreads should still materialize even if delayed and 2) client assets in the aggregate continue to grow at a healthy pace driven by market gains and organic growth. Overall,\u00a0 SCHW ranks 5th on our list of the best financial services stocks to buy according to analysts.\u00a0While we acknowledge the potential for SCHW to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SCHW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock .

Services Stocks to Buy According to Analysts? Fatima Gulzar Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 7:11 PM 8 min read In This Article: PGR +1.01% We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Financial Services Stocks To Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) stands against the other best financial services stocks to buy according to analysts. According to the Financial Industry Index, which increased by more than 30% by mid-December and beat the overall market by about 5 percentage points, 2024 was a spectacular year for the financial industry. This growth followed concerns about mid-sized bank collapses in early 2024, which proved to be isolated incidents rather than an issue impacting the industry as a whole. Meanwhile, as we have mentioned in our article, 10 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds , the market for financial services has expanded significantly in the last several years and is further expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7% in the next few years. Amidst the growth, as per EY\u2019s report, the financial services industry is also undergoing a change because of artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI, which boosts productivity, modifications, and innovation. AI is helping banks provide individual solutions and improve risk control while accelerating processes like fraud detection, loan processing, and customer support. Large financial institutions are using AI to lower expenses, improve compliance, and create new products like automated tax compliance and predictive analytics. Nonetheless, issues like data privacy, rules of conduct, and AI\u2019s \u201cblack box\u201d decision-making continue to exist. Notwithstanding these obstacles, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing financial services by spreading beyond banking to include wealth management, insurance, and payments. According to IBM\u2019s report 2024, Generative AI is revolutionizing financial services by improving customer satisfaction and propelling advancements in risk assessment as well as personalized financial solutions. Secondly, the use of hybrid clouds is growing as companies seek to boost compliance, scalability, and efficiency. Thirdly, cybersecurity is still crucial, with growing investment in fraud detection systems as AI-driven threats emerge. Businesses are putting a greater spotlight on sustainability by giving green financial products and ESG initiatives top priority. By utilizing AI technologies such as Watsonx Assistant, customer experience management (CXM) increases customer pleasure and loyalty. Moreover, the use of open banking is growing as a result of APIs\u2019 ability to simplify procedures and provide customers with more control over their data. Secure online transactions are being reinforced by the resurgence of digital currencies and blockchain. Story Continues Looking ahead, Deloitte\u2019s 2025 investment management outlook predicts that AI, digital transformation, and changing investor demands will quickly impact the investment management industry in 2025. Low-cost funds are dominant, with active management flourishing within ETFs. Sustainability-focused investments, hybrid funds, and private financing are important growth areas. AI has exceeded expectations and is transforming operations and sales, but companies that are not embracing it quickly could fall behind. Regulatory changes, cybersecurity, and the combination of traditional and alternative assets are examples of growing risks. While some companies may find it difficult to survive in a high-risk, high-reward environment, bold companies that use AI and diversify their products may benefit from these changes. The key to success is scaling innovation and satisfying the need for sustainable, affordable solutions. On the other hand, Deloitte\u2019s 2025 banking and capital markets outlook report stated that banks can strengthen their basis for sustainable growth with creativity and discipline as the banking industry adjusts to a low-growth, lower-rate environment. It is anticipated that GDP growth will be 1.5% in 2025, and inflation will be approaching the 2% target, presenting a low-growth, lower-rate scenario for US banks. With savings exhausted by March 2024 and debt reaching $17.7 trillion, consumer spending may decline. Net interest margins may be compressed as a result of declining interest rates, with the federal funds rate falling to 350-375 basis points. Noninterest income presents opportunities, but growing salaries and technology expenditures drive up costs. Credit quality may slightly improve but is expected to stabilize. As geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty further complicate the picture, Deloitte observes that weak business investment and higher deposit costs will test banks\u2019 adaptability. 10 Best Financial Services Stocks To Buy According to Analysts A team of accountants in a boardroom, discussing strategic moves of an insurance company. Methodology We sifted through holdings of financial ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 financial services stocks. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with a projected upside potential of over 7% based on analyst price targets, as of January 9. The stocks are ranked according to their upside potential. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. ( see more details here ) The Progressive Corporation (NYSE: PGR ) Upside Potential as of January 9: 12.41% One of the largest auto insurers in the US, Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) offers specialized lines in addition to private and commercial auto insurance. It currently has over 20 million personal auto policies in effect. The business sells its products directly to consumers via the phone, online, and through independent insurance brokers in the US and Canada. Its premiums are almost evenly split between the agent and direct channels. Through an acquisition in 2015, the company branched out into homeowners insurance and now offers commercial auto products. The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR), one of the best financial stocks and one of the most successful franchises in the insurance business has consistently generated returns that are at the top of the market. However, the business has seen a great deal of volatility as a result of the recent fluctuations in the auto insurance market. The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) had a strong third quarter, with revenue of $19.46 billion, a 27% year-over-year increase, and GAAP EPS of $3.97, $0.08 more than anticipated. The company\u2019s combined ratio of 89% revealed profitability because it paid out less in claims and expenses than it made in premiums. The firm added a record 1.6 million new policies due to significant media investment and strong demand. Strong growth in both direct and agency channels was the result of record-high direct channel applications and improved customer conversions, positioning the company for sustained gains in market share. JPMorgan increased its price target on The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) from $251 to $256. Going into 2025, the analyst is still optimistic about business trends in the property and casualty industry and believes that the group will perform better because of its defensive risk profile and consistent firm pricing. In a research note, the analyst warned investors that current valuations, high sentiment, and optimistic earnings expectations \u201cmake the upside in stocks less compelling than a year ago.\u201d Due to a favorable perception of margins, the company is most optimistic about personal lines stocks by segment. Thomas Bancroft\u2019s Makaira Partners was the largest stakeholder in the company from among the funds in Insider Monkey\u2019s database. It owns 603,603 shares worth $153.17 million as of Q3. Bretton Fund stated the following regarding The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) in its Q3 2024 investor letter : \u201cWe think The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) is the most sophisticated auto insurer in the business. It leverages its vast amount of driver data and is usually one of the first in the industry to recognize important shifts in things like driver behavior and collision costs. Progressive was one of the first to raise rates aggressively in 2021 to offset the higher costs from the more frequent car crashes and higher repair costs post-Covid. By raising prices before its competitors did, Progressive lost customers and wasn\u2019t able to grow as fast as it usually does. The rest of the industry has since caught up and increased rates. Progressive\u2019s rates are now comparatively attractive once again, and that\u2019s led to highly profitable growth. Through September 30, its premiums are up 20% over last year, which is great for a low-growth industry like auto insurance. Progressive added 1.5% to the fund this quarter.\u201d Overall,\u00a0 PGR ranks 4th on our list of the best financial services stocks to buy according to analysts.\u00a0While we acknowledge the potential for PGR to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PGR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock .

Services Stocks to Buy According to Analysts? Fatima Gulzar Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 7:16 PM 7 min read In This Article: ICE +0.35% We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Financial Services Stocks To Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE) stands against the other best financial services stocks to buy according to analysts. According to the Financial Industry Index, which increased by more than 30% by mid-December and beat the overall market by about 5 percentage points, 2024 was a spectacular year for the financial industry. This growth followed concerns about mid-sized bank collapses in early 2024, which proved to be isolated incidents rather than an issue impacting the industry as a whole. Meanwhile, as we have mentioned in our article, 10 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds , the market for financial services has expanded significantly in the last several years and is further expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7% in the next few years. Amidst the growth, as per EY\u2019s report, the financial services industry is also undergoing a change because of artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI, which boosts productivity, modifications, and innovation. AI is helping banks provide individual solutions and improve risk control while accelerating processes like fraud detection, loan processing, and customer support. Large financial institutions are using AI to lower expenses, improve compliance, and create new products like automated tax compliance and predictive analytics. Nonetheless, issues like data privacy, rules of conduct, and AI\u2019s \u201cblack box\u201d decision-making continue to exist. Notwithstanding these obstacles, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing financial services by spreading beyond banking to include wealth management, insurance, and payments. According to IBM\u2019s report 2024, Generative AI is revolutionizing financial services by improving customer satisfaction and propelling advancements in risk assessment as well as personalized financial solutions. Secondly, the use of hybrid clouds is growing as companies seek to boost compliance, scalability, and efficiency. Thirdly, cybersecurity is still crucial, with growing investment in fraud detection systems as AI-driven threats emerge. Businesses are putting a greater spotlight on sustainability by giving green financial products and ESG initiatives top priority. By utilizing AI technologies such as Watsonx Assistant, customer experience management (CXM) increases customer pleasure and loyalty. Moreover, the use of open banking is growing as a result of APIs\u2019 ability to simplify procedures and provide customers with more control over their data. Secure online transactions are being reinforced by the resurgence of digital currencies and blockchain. Story Continues Looking ahead, Deloitte\u2019s 2025 investment management outlook predicts that AI, digital transformation, and changing investor demands will quickly impact the investment management industry in 2025. Low-cost funds are dominant, with active management flourishing within ETFs. Sustainability-focused investments, hybrid funds, and private financing are important growth areas. AI has exceeded expectations and is transforming operations and sales, but companies that are not embracing it quickly could fall behind. Regulatory changes, cybersecurity, and the combination of traditional and alternative assets are examples of growing risks. While some companies may find it difficult to survive in a high-risk, high-reward environment, bold companies that use AI and diversify their products may benefit from these changes. The key to success is scaling innovation and satisfying the need for sustainable, affordable solutions. On the other hand, Deloitte\u2019s 2025 banking and capital markets outlook report stated that banks can strengthen their basis for sustainable growth with creativity and discipline as the banking industry adjusts to a low-growth, lower-rate environment.

to Buy According to Analysts? Fatima Gulzar Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 7:18 PM 7 min read In This Article: RY -2.56% We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Financial Services Stocks To Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY) stands against the other best financial services stocks to buy according to analysts. According to the Financial Industry Index, which increased by more than 30% by mid-December and beat the overall market by about 5 percentage points, 2024 was a spectacular year for the financial industry. This growth followed concerns about mid-sized bank collapses in early 2024, which proved to be isolated incidents rather than an issue impacting the industry as a whole. Meanwhile, as we have mentioned in our article, 10 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds , the market for financial services has expanded significantly in the last several years and is further expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7% in the next few years. Amidst the growth, as per EY\u2019s report, the financial services industry is also undergoing a change because of artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI, which boosts productivity, modifications, and innovation. AI is helping banks provide individual solutions and improve risk control while accelerating processes like fraud detection, loan processing, and customer support. Large financial institutions are using AI to lower expenses, improve compliance, and create new products like automated tax compliance and predictive analytics. Nonetheless, issues like data privacy, rules of conduct, and AI\u2019s \u201cblack box\u201d decision-making continue to exist. Notwithstanding these obstacles, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing financial services by spreading beyond banking to include wealth management, insurance, and payments. According to IBM\u2019s report 2024, Generative AI is revolutionizing financial services by improving customer satisfaction and propelling advancements in risk assessment as well as personalized financial solutions. Secondly, the use of hybrid clouds is growing as companies seek to boost compliance, scalability, and efficiency. Thirdly, cybersecurity is still crucial, with growing investment in fraud detection systems as AI-driven threats emerge. Businesses are putting a greater spotlight on sustainability by giving green financial products and ESG initiatives top priority. By utilizing AI technologies such as Watsonx Assistant, customer experience management (CXM) increases customer pleasure and loyalty. Moreover, the use of open banking is growing as a result of APIs\u2019 ability to simplify procedures and provide customers with more control over their data. Secure online transactions are being reinforced by the resurgence of digital currencies and blockchain. Story Continues Looking ahead, Deloitte\u2019s 2025 investment management outlook predicts that AI, digital transformation, and changing investor demands will quickly impact the investment management industry in 2025. Low-cost funds are dominant, with active management flourishing within ETFs. Sustainability-focused investments, hybrid funds, and private financing are important growth areas. AI has exceeded expectations and is transforming operations and sales, but companies that are not embracing it quickly could fall behind. Regulatory changes, cybersecurity, and the combination of traditional and alternative assets are examples of growing risks. While some companies may find it difficult to survive in a high-risk, high-reward environment, bold companies that use AI and diversify their products may benefit from these changes. The key to success is scaling innovation and satisfying the need for sustainable, affordable solutions. On the other hand, Deloitte\u2019s 2025 banking and capital markets outlook report stated that banks can strengthen their basis for sustainable growth with creativity and discipline as the banking industry adjusts to a low-growth, lower-rate environment. It is anticipated that GDP growth will be 1.5% in 2025, and inflation will be approaching the 2% target, presenting a low-growth, lower-rate scenario for US banks. With savings exhausted by March 2024 and debt reaching $17.7 trillion, consumer spending may decline. Net interest margins may be compressed as a result of declining interest rates, with the federal funds rate falling to 350-375 basis points. Noninterest income presents opportunities, but growing salaries and technology expenditures drive up costs. Credit quality may slightly improve but is expected to stabilize. As geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty further complicate the picture, Deloitte observes that weak business investment and higher deposit costs will test banks\u2019 adaptability. 10 Best Financial Services Stocks To Buy According to Analysts An investment banker in a power suit entering an exclusive board room with a confident stride.

to Buy According to Analysts? Fatima Gulzar Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 7:00 PM 7 min read In This Article: CB +0.75% We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Financial Services Stocks To Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) stands against the other best financial services stocks to buy according to analysts. According to the Financial Industry Index, which increased by more than 30% by mid-December and beat the overall market by about 5 percentage points, 2024 was a spectacular year for the financial industry. This growth followed concerns about mid-sized bank collapses in early 2024, which proved to be isolated incidents rather than an issue impacting the industry as a whole. Meanwhile, as we have mentioned in our article, 10 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds , the market for financial services has expanded significantly in the last several years and is further expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7% in the next few years. Amidst the growth, as per EY\u2019s report, the financial services industry is also undergoing a change because of artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI, which boosts productivity, modifications, and innovation. AI is helping banks provide individual solutions and improve risk control while accelerating processes like fraud detection, loan processing, and customer support. Large financial institutions are using AI to lower expenses, improve compliance, and create new products like automated tax compliance and predictive analytics. Nonetheless, issues like data privacy, rules of conduct, and AI\u2019s \u201cblack box\u201d decision-making continue to exist. Notwithstanding these obstacles, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing financial services by spreading beyond banking to include wealth management, insurance, and payments. According to IBM\u2019s report 2024, Generative AI is revolutionizing financial services by improving customer satisfaction and propelling advancements in risk assessment as well as personalized financial solutions. Secondly, the use of hybrid clouds is growing as companies seek to boost compliance, scalability, and efficiency. Thirdly, cybersecurity is still crucial, with growing investment in fraud detection systems as AI-driven threats emerge. Businesses are putting a greater spotlight on sustainability by giving green financial products and ESG initiatives top priority. By utilizing AI technologies such as Watsonx Assistant, customer experience management (CXM) increases customer pleasure and loyalty. Moreover, the use of open banking is growing as a result of APIs\u2019 ability to simplify procedures and provide customers with more control over their data. Secure online transactions are being reinforced by the resurgence of digital currencies and blockchain. Story Continues Looking ahead, Deloitte\u2019s 2025 investment management outlook predicts that AI, digital transformation, and changing investor demands will quickly impact the investment management industry in 2025. Low-cost funds are dominant, with active management flourishing within ETFs. Sustainability-focused investments, hybrid funds, and private financing are important growth areas. AI has exceeded expectations and is transforming operations and sales, but companies that are not embracing it quickly could fall behind. Regulatory changes, cybersecurity, and the combination of traditional and alternative assets are examples of growing risks. While some companies may find it difficult to survive in a high-risk, high-reward environment, bold companies that use AI and diversify their products may benefit from these changes. The key to success is scaling innovation and satisfying the need for sustainable, affordable solutions. On the other hand, Deloitte\u2019s 2025 banking and capital markets outlook report stated that banks can strengthen their basis for sustainable growth with creativity and discipline as the banking industry adjusts to a low-growth, lower-rate environment. It is anticipated that GDP growth will be 1.5% in 2025, and inflation will be approaching the 2% target, presenting a low-growth, lower-rate scenario for US banks. With savings exhausted by March 2024 and debt reaching $17.7 trillion, consumer spending may decline. Net interest margins may be compressed as a result of declining interest rates, with the federal funds rate falling to 350-375 basis points. Noninterest income presents opportunities, but growing salaries and technology expenditures drive up costs. Credit quality may slightly improve but is expected to stabilize. As geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty further complicate the picture, Deloitte observes that weak business investment and higher deposit costs will test banks\u2019 adaptability. 10 Best Financial Services Stocks To Buy According to Analysts A close-up of an insurance agent's hand pointing to a marine insurance policy, highlighting the company's expertise in marine coverage.

Financial Services Stocks to Buy According to Analysts? Fatima Gulzar Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 7:04 PM 8 min read In This Article: MA +1.53% We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Financial Services Stocks To Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) stands against the other best financial services stocks to buy according to analysts. According to the Financial Industry Index, which increased by more than 30% by mid-December and beat the overall market by about 5 percentage points, 2024 was a spectacular year for the financial industry. This growth followed concerns about mid-sized bank collapses in early 2024, which proved to be isolated incidents rather than an issue impacting the industry as a whole. Meanwhile, as we have mentioned in our article, 10 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds , the market for financial services has expanded significantly in the last several years and is further expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7% in the next few years. Amidst the growth, as per EY\u2019s report, the financial services industry is also undergoing a change because of artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI, which boosts productivity, modifications, and innovation. AI is helping banks provide individual solutions and improve risk control while accelerating processes like fraud detection, loan processing, and customer support. Large financial institutions are using AI to lower expenses, improve compliance, and create new products like automated tax compliance and predictive analytics. Nonetheless, issues like data privacy, rules of conduct, and AI\u2019s \u201cblack box\u201d decision-making continue to exist. Notwithstanding these obstacles, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing financial services by spreading beyond banking to include wealth management, insurance, and payments. According to IBM\u2019s report 2024, Generative AI is revolutionizing financial services by improving customer satisfaction and propelling advancements in risk assessment as well as personalized financial solutions. Secondly, the use of hybrid clouds is growing as companies seek to boost compliance, scalability, and efficiency. Thirdly, cybersecurity is still crucial, with growing investment in fraud detection systems as AI-driven threats emerge. Businesses are putting a greater spotlight on sustainability by giving green financial products and ESG initiatives top priority. By utilizing AI technologies such as Watsonx Assistant, customer experience management (CXM) increases customer pleasure and loyalty. Moreover, the use of open banking is growing as a result of APIs\u2019 ability to simplify procedures and provide customers with more control over their data. Secure online transactions are being reinforced by the resurgence of digital currencies and blockchain. Story Continues Looking ahead, Deloitte\u2019s 2025 investment management outlook predicts that AI, digital transformation, and changing investor demands will quickly impact the investment management industry in 2025. Low-cost funds are dominant, with active management flourishing within ETFs. Sustainability-focused investments, hybrid funds, and private financing are important growth areas. AI has exceeded expectations and is transforming operations and sales, but companies that are not embracing it quickly could fall behind. Regulatory changes, cybersecurity, and the combination of traditional and alternative assets are examples of growing risks. While some companies may find it difficult to survive in a high-risk, high-reward environment, bold companies that use AI and diversify their products may benefit from these changes. The key to success is scaling innovation and satisfying the need for sustainable, affordable solutions. On the other hand, Deloitte\u2019s 2025 banking and capital markets outlook report stated that banks can strengthen their basis for sustainable growth with creativity and discipline as the banking industry adjusts to a low-growth, lower-rate environment. It is anticipated that GDP growth will be 1.5% in 2025, and inflation will be approaching the 2% target, presenting a low-growth, lower-rate scenario for US banks. With savings exhausted by March 2024 and debt reaching $17.7 trillion, consumer spending may decline. Net interest margins may be compressed as a result of declining interest rates, with the federal funds rate falling to 350-375 basis points. Noninterest income presents opportunities, but growing salaries and technology expenditures drive up costs. Credit quality may slightly improve but is expected to stabilize. As geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty further complicate the picture, Deloitte observes that weak business investment and higher deposit costs will test banks\u2019 adaptability. 10 Best Financial Services Stocks To Buy According to Analysts A woman using a payment terminal at the checkout of a store showing payment products and solutions.

Best Financial Services Stocks to Buy According to Analysts? Fatima Gulzar Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 7:06 PM 6 min read In This Article: BRK-B -0.87% We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Financial Services Stocks To Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.B) stands against the other best financial services stocks to buy according to analysts. According to the Financial Industry Index, which increased by more than 30% by mid-December and beat the overall market by about 5 percentage points, 2024 was a spectacular year for the financial industry. This growth followed concerns about mid-sized bank collapses in early 2024, which proved to be isolated incidents rather than an issue impacting the industry as a whole. Meanwhile, as we have mentioned in our article, 10 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds , the market for financial services has expanded significantly in the last several years and is further expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7% in the next few years. Amidst the growth, as per EY\u2019s report, the financial services industry is also undergoing a change because of artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI, which boosts productivity, modifications, and innovation. AI is helping banks provide individual solutions and improve risk control while accelerating processes like fraud detection, loan processing, and customer support. Large financial institutions are using AI to lower expenses, improve compliance, and create new products like automated tax compliance and predictive analytics. Nonetheless, issues like data privacy, rules of conduct, and AI\u2019s \u201cblack box\u201d decision-making continue to exist. Notwithstanding these obstacles, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing financial services by spreading beyond banking to include wealth management, insurance, and payments. According to IBM\u2019s report 2024, Generative AI is revolutionizing financial services by improving customer satisfaction and propelling advancements in risk assessment as well as personalized financial solutions. Secondly, the use of hybrid clouds is growing as companies seek to boost compliance, scalability, and efficiency. Thirdly, cybersecurity is still crucial, with growing investment in fraud detection systems as AI-driven threats emerge. Businesses are putting a greater spotlight on sustainability by giving green financial products and ESG initiatives top priority. By utilizing AI technologies such as Watsonx Assistant, customer experience management (CXM) increases customer pleasure and loyalty. Moreover, the use of open banking is growing as a result of APIs\u2019 ability to simplify procedures and provide customers with more control over their data. Secure online transactions are being reinforced by the resurgence of digital currencies and blockchain. Story Continues Looking ahead, Deloitte\u2019s 2025 investment management outlook predicts that AI, digital transformation, and changing investor demands will quickly impact the investment management industry in 2025. Low-cost funds are dominant, with active management flourishing within ETFs. Sustainability-focused investments, hybrid funds, and private financing are important growth areas. AI has exceeded expectations and is transforming operations and sales, but companies that are not embracing it quickly could fall behind. Regulatory changes, cybersecurity, and the combination of traditional and alternative assets are examples of growing risks. While some companies may find it difficult to survive in a high-risk, high-reward environment, bold companies that use AI and diversify their products may benefit from these changes. The key to success is scaling innovation and satisfying the need for sustainable, affordable solutions. On the other hand, Deloitte\u2019s 2025 banking and capital markets outlook report stated that banks can strengthen their basis for sustainable growth with creativity and discipline as the banking industry adjusts to a low-growth, lower-rate environment. It is anticipated that GDP growth will be 1.5% in 2025, and inflation will be approaching the 2% target, presenting a low-growth, lower-rate scenario for US banks. With savings exhausted by March 2024 and debt reaching $17.7 trillion, consumer spending may decline. Net interest margins may be compressed as a result of declining interest rates, with the federal funds rate falling to 350-375 basis points. Noninterest income presents opportunities, but growing salaries and technology expenditures drive up costs. Credit quality may slightly improve but is expected to stabilize. As geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty further complicate the picture, Deloitte observes that weak business investment and higher deposit costs will test banks\u2019 adaptability. 10 Best Financial Services Stocks To Buy According to Analysts A financial advisor in a suit, pen in hand, talking to a client in the bank.

According to Analysts? Fatima Gulzar Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 7:01 PM 7 min read In This Article: C -1.56% We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Financial Services Stocks To Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) stands against the other best financial services stocks to buy according to analysts. According to the Financial Industry Index, which increased by more than 30% by mid-December and beat the overall market by about 5 percentage points, 2024 was a spectacular year for the financial industry. This growth followed concerns about mid-sized bank collapses in early 2024, which proved to be isolated incidents rather than an issue impacting the industry as a whole. Meanwhile, as we have mentioned in our article, 10 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds , the market for financial services has expanded significantly in the last several years and is further expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7% in the next few years. Amidst the growth, as per EY\u2019s report, the financial services industry is also undergoing a change because of artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI, which boosts productivity, modifications, and innovation. AI is helping banks provide individual solutions and improve risk control while accelerating processes like fraud detection, loan processing, and customer support. Large financial institutions are using AI to lower expenses, improve compliance, and create new products like automated tax compliance and predictive analytics. Nonetheless, issues like data privacy, rules of conduct, and AI\u2019s \u201cblack box\u201d decision-making continue to exist. Notwithstanding these obstacles, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing financial services by spreading beyond banking to include wealth management, insurance, and payments. According to IBM\u2019s report 2024, Generative AI is revolutionizing financial services by improving customer satisfaction and propelling advancements in risk assessment as well as personalized financial solutions. Secondly, the use of hybrid clouds is growing as companies seek to boost compliance, scalability, and efficiency. Thirdly, cybersecurity is still crucial, with growing investment in fraud detection systems as AI-driven threats emerge. Businesses are putting a greater spotlight on sustainability by giving green financial products and ESG initiatives top priority. By utilizing AI technologies such as Watsonx Assistant, customer experience management (CXM) increases customer pleasure and loyalty. Moreover, the use of open banking is growing as a result of APIs\u2019 ability to simplify procedures and provide customers with more control over their data. Secure online transactions are being reinforced by the resurgence of digital currencies and blockchain. Story Continues Looking ahead, Deloitte\u2019s 2025 investment management outlook predicts that AI, digital transformation, and changing investor demands will quickly impact the investment management industry in 2025. Low-cost funds are dominant, with active management flourishing within ETFs. Sustainability-focused investments, hybrid funds, and private financing are important growth areas. AI has exceeded expectations and is transforming operations and sales, but companies that are not embracing it quickly could fall behind. Regulatory changes, cybersecurity, and the combination of traditional and alternative assets are examples of growing risks. While some companies may find it difficult to survive in a high-risk, high-reward environment, bold companies that use AI and diversify their products may benefit from these changes. The key to success is scaling innovation and satisfying the need for sustainable, affordable solutions. On the other hand, Deloitte\u2019s 2025 banking and capital markets outlook report stated that banks can strengthen their basis for sustainable growth with creativity and discipline as the banking industry adjusts to a low-growth, lower-rate environment. It is anticipated that GDP growth will be 1.5% in 2025, and inflation will be approaching the 2% target, presenting a low-growth, lower-rate scenario for US banks. With savings exhausted by March 2024 and debt reaching $17.7 trillion, consumer spending may decline. Net interest margins may be compressed as a result of declining interest rates, with the federal funds rate falling to 350-375 basis points. Noninterest income presents opportunities, but growing salaries and technology expenditures drive up costs. Credit quality may slightly improve but is expected to stabilize. As geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty further complicate the picture, Deloitte observes that weak business investment and higher deposit costs will test banks\u2019 adaptability. 10 Best Financial Services Stocks To Buy According to Analysts A customer walking into a bank branch, expressing the convenience of consumer banking services. Methodology We sifted through holdings of financial ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 financial services stocks. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with a projected upside potential of over 7% based on analyst price targets, as of January 9. The stocks are ranked according to their upside potential. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. ( see more details here ) Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C ) Upside Potential as of January 9: 9.10% Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), one of the Best Financial Stocks , is a global financial services company that operates in over 100 different countries and territories. The company\u2019s operations are divided into five primary categories: US personal banking, markets, wealth management, banking, and services. The bank\u2019s primary services include US credit card services, trade and investment banking, and cross-border banking requirements for multinational companies. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) operates a domestic retail banking division as well as an international commercial banking franchise. Large trading, investment banking, international corporate banking, and custody operations are all part of the bank\u2019s commercial operations, which are divided into services, markets, and banking segments (previously known as Institutional Client Group or ICG). The company\u2019s most distinctive business, considering its global presence, is its commercial banking segment. This global reach will help maintain its position as a favored bank for multinational firms. Despite these advantages, maintaining a global presence is expensive and challenging, and the bank\u2019s markets division makes a small profit. As a result, the commercial banking industry has experienced several benefits. As part of its strategic repositioning, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) is selling off its consumer business in Mexico and reinvesting in wealth and commercial banking, among other significant actions. The company might at last become a franchise with structural improvements. With the exception of divestitures, the company\u2019s overall revenues increased by 3% in the third quarter of 2024 as each of its major segments enjoyed growth and improved operating leverage. Higher loan and deposit volumes, along with a significant fee increase, drove the Services segment\u2019s 8% revenue gain, setting a new quarterly record. Significant progress was also made in wealth management, as evidenced by a 24% increase in client investment assets and a 9% rise in revenues. At Citigold North America, adviser productivity increased by over 50% YoY. Investment banking fees increased 44% year over year due to the issuance of investment-grade debt and strong advising performance. In addition, the company maintained a good CET1 capital ratio of 13.7% while returning $2.1 billion in capital, including $1 billion in share repurchases. Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway was the largest stakeholder in the company among the funds in Insider Monkey\u2019s database at the end of Q3 2024. It owns 55.24 million shares worth $3.46 billion as of Q3. Overall,\u00a0 C ranks 8th on our list of the best financial services stocks to buy according to analysts.\u00a0While we acknowledge the potential for C to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than C but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock .

This growth followed concerns about mid-sized bank collapses in early 2024, which proved to be isolated incidents rather than an issue impacting the industry as a whole. Meanwhile, as we have mentioned in our article, 10 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds , the market for financial services has expanded significantly in the last several years and is further expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7% in the next few years. Amidst the growth, as per EY\u2019s report, the financial services industry is also undergoing a change because of artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI, which boosts productivity, modifications, and innovation. AI is helping banks provide individual solutions and improve risk control while accelerating processes like fraud detection, loan processing, and customer support. Large financial institutions are using AI to lower expenses, improve compliance, and create new products like automated tax compliance and predictive analytics. Nonetheless, issues like data privacy, rules of conduct, and AI\u2019s \u201cblack box\u201d decision-making continue to exist. Notwithstanding these obstacles, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing financial services by spreading beyond banking to include wealth management, insurance, and payments. According to IBM\u2019s report 2024, Generative AI is revolutionizing financial services by improving customer satisfaction and propelling advancements in risk assessment as well as personalized financial solutions. Secondly, the use of hybrid clouds is growing as companies seek to boost compliance, scalability, and efficiency. Thirdly, cybersecurity is still crucial, with growing investment in fraud detection systems as AI-driven threats emerge. Businesses are putting a greater spotlight on sustainability by giving green financial products and ESG initiatives top priority. By utilizing AI technologies such as Watsonx Assistant, customer experience management (CXM) increases customer pleasure and loyalty. Moreover, the use of open banking is growing as a result of APIs\u2019 ability to simplify procedures and provide customers with more control over their data. Secure online transactions are being reinforced by the resurgence of digital currencies and blockchain. \u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80 Looking ahead, Deloitte\u2019s 2025 investment management outlook predicts that AI, digital transformation, and changing investor demands will quickly impact the investment management industry in 2025. Low-cost funds are dominant, with active management flourishing within ETFs. Sustainability-focused investments, hybrid funds, and private financing are important growth areas. AI has exceeded expectations and is transforming operations and sales, but companies that are not embracing it quickly could fall behind. Regulatory changes, cybersecurity, and the combination of traditional and alternative assets are examples of growing risks. While some companies may find it difficult to survive in a high-risk, high-reward environment, bold companies that use AI and diversify their products may benefit from these changes. The key to success is scaling innovation and satisfying the need for sustainable, affordable solutions. On the other hand, Deloitte\u2019s 2025 banking and capital markets outlook report stated that banks can strengthen their basis for sustainable growth with creativity and discipline as the banking industry adjusts to a low-growth, lower-rate environment. It is anticipated that GDP growth will be 1.5% in 2025, and inflation will be approaching the 2% target, presenting a low-growth, lower-rate scenario for US banks. With savings exhausted by March 2024 and debt reaching $17.7 trillion, consumer spending may decline. Net interest margins may be compressed as a result of declining interest rates, with the federal funds rate falling to 350-375 basis points. Noninterest income presents opportunities, but growing salaries and technology expenditures drive up costs. Credit quality may slightly improve but is expected to stabilize. As geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty further complicate the picture, Deloitte observes that weak business investment and higher deposit costs will test banks\u2019 adaptability. 10 Best Financial Services Stocks To Buy According to Analysts A financial analyst looking at the news, analyzing the trends of the insurance market.

(Nasdaq: ITOS), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the discovery and development of a new generation of immuno-oncology therapeutics for patients, today outlined business updates and strategic priorities for 2025. \u201cAs iTeos enters 2025, we are well-positioned to emerge as a leading oncology company by advancing therapies with first- or best-in-class potential that target resistance mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment. Starting in the second quarter, this year will feature robust TIGIT datasets in both non-small cell lung cancer and head and neck cancer, aiming to highlight the differentiation with our unique TIGIT:PD-1 doublet, belrestotug + dostarlimab. We are also excited about EOS-984 and EOS-215, our early-stage programs which demonstrate our track record of designing and developing innovative and differentiated therapies,\u201d said Michel Detheux, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of iTeos. \u201cWe look forward to a pivotal year for our company, with multiple data readouts and continued progress across our oncology portfolio.\u201d Program Highlights Belrestotug (EOS-448/GSKFF28849A): IgG1 anti-TIGIT monoclonal antibody in development for the first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic PD-L1-high non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and for the first-line treatment of PD-L1 positive recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in collaboration with GSK. GALAXIES Lung-301 Enrollment ongoing globally in randomized, double-blind Phase 3 registrational study assessing belrestotug + dostarlimab versus placebo + pembrolizumab in patients with first-line advanced, unresectable, or metastatic PD-L1 high NSCLC Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and The National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) granted clearance to advance belrestotug 400mg + dostarlimab as the recommended Phase 3 dose, allowing for the activation of clinical sites in the U.S. and China, respectively. GALAXIES Lung-201 Topline interim data from Phase 2 platform study assessing belrestotug + dostarlimab doublet and a triplet with GSK\u2019s investigational anti-CD96 antibody, nelistotug, in first-line advanced / metastatic PD-L1 high NSCLC anticipated in 2Q25 to include safety, ORR, and ctDNA data from >240 patients, with pembrolizumab monotherapy ORR for 30 patients and PFS data from initial 124 patients treated. Data are expected to be submitted for presentation at a scientific congress in 2H 2025. Story Continues GALAXIES H&N-202 Interim data from Phase 2 platform study assessing belrestotug + dostarlimab doublet and triplet with nelistotug in first-line patients with PD-L1 positive recurrent/metastatic HNSCC anticipated in 2025 to include safety and ORR from >150 patients. TIG-006 HNSCC Topline data from the TIG-006 study in cohorts 2C & 2D assessing belrestotug + dostarlimab doublet in first-line PD-L1 positive advanced / metastatic HNSCC anticipated in 2025 to include safety, ORR, and PFS from a total of 42 patients. EOS-984: Potential first-in-class small molecule in oncology inhibiting ENT1, a dominant transporter of adenosine involved in T cell metabolism, expansion, effector function, and survival. APT-008 Topline data assessing EOS-984 as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors anticipated in 2H25. EOS-215: Potential best-in-class anti-TREM2 with a novel mechanism of action blocking monoclonal antibody targeting tumor-associated macrophages to reprogram the tumor microenvironment. TRM-010 Investigative New Drug (IND) application for EOS-215 anticipated in 1Q25. Financial Updates Cash Position: The Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalent position was $683.9 million as of September 30, 2024, inclusive of a $35.0 million milestone received relating to the dosing of the first patient in the GALAXIES Lung-301 clinical trial. The Company expects its cash balance to provide runway through 2027, which includes the potential initiation of multiple Phase 3 registrational trials assessing belrestotug + dostarlimab doublet. About iTeos Therapeutics, Inc. i Teos Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the discovery and development of a new generation of immuno-oncology therapeutics for patients. iTeos Therapeutics leverages its deep understanding of tumor immunology and immunosuppressive pathways to design novel product candidates with the potential to restore the immune response against cancer. The Company\u2019s innovative pipeline includes three clinical-stage programs targeting novel, validated immunosuppressive pathways designed with optimized pharmacologic properties for improved clinical outcomes. iTeos Therapeutics is headquartered in Watertown, MA with a research center in Gosselies, Belgium. About Belrestotug (EOS-448/ GSK4428859A) Belrestotug is an Fc active human immunoglobulin G1, or IgG1, monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting T cell immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif domains (TIGIT), an important inhibitory receptor which contributes to the suppression of adaptive and innate immune responses against cancer. As an optimized high-affinity, potent anti-TIGIT mAb, belrestotug is designed to enhance the antitumor response through a multifaceted immune modulatory mechanism by engaging with TIGIT and Fc\u03b3R, a key regulator of immune responses which induces cytokine release and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). The therapeutic candidate is progressing in multiple indications in collaboration with GSK. About EOS-984 EOS-984 is a potential first-in-class small molecule targeting equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) designed to inhibit the immunosuppressive activity of adenosine and restore immune cell proliferation. The therapeutic candidate has the potential to fully reverse the profound immunosuppressive action of adenosine on T and B cells and is in Phase 1 development. About EOS-215 EOS-215 is a potential best-in-class monoclonal antibody which blocks ligand binding to triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), switching off multiple tumor growth and survival promoting activities of tumor resident macrophages and effectively \u201creprogramming\u201d the macrophages to allow for T cell activation. The therapeutic candidate has shown activity in both in vitro and in vivo highly immune resistant models and is currently in IND-enabling studies.

min read Artificial intelligence (AI) is everywhere you look, and the financial services sector is no different. Banks and other financial firms like hedge funds were some of the first institutions to adopt artificial intelligence at a corporate level, while new technological advances and applications mean that AI usage is more widespread than ever. These new applications promise a myriad of benefits for the firms that adopt AI and their customers, who are interacting with the technology in new ways and opening the door to further possibilities. But how exactly is AI being used to transform the world of commercial finance? Anglo Scottish Finance takes a look. Key findings In November 2023, 28 international governments met at the Bletchley Summit and agreed to work together to manage worldwide AI usage. 77% of bankers believe that unlocking maximum value from AI technologies will be the difference between successful and unsuccessful banks. 45% of people working in financial services view generative AI as a friend, though a further 40% view it as a foe. Banks spend nearly \u00a3219.7bn each year on tackling financial crime. 71% of UK investors are comfortable using AI to provide product recommendations \u2013 an 8% rise from 2022. 79% of financial services leaders find that a personalised experience increases customer retention. 57% of businesses are currently taking a reactive approach to artificial intelligence. Embracing the future? For those working within financial services, the outlook on AI is certainly mixed. Generative AI \u2013 forms of artificial intelligence capable of generating their own image, text or other forms of media \u2013 are typically viewed with caution. 45% of people working in financial services view generative AI as a friend, though a further 40% view it as a foe. Despite this mixed view, 77% of bankers believe that unlocking maximum value from AI technologies will be the difference between successful and unsuccessful banks. Its value cannot be understated. There are, of course, concerns around employment: 73% of financial services executives believe that generative AI will take their jobs. Thankfully, those aged 25\u201334 \u2013 who will largely be driving AI adoption forward \u2013 feel markedly more positive about AI. Those concerned about redundancies should not fear \u2013 for the present day, at least. At the moment, AI is best used as a supportive, augmentative tool, utilising human input to maximise the tool\u2019s potential. Tackling financial crime Banks spend nearly \u00a3219.7bn each year on tackling financial crime. It\u2019s a difficult \u2013 and often thankless \u2013 task, given the sheer number of transactions that must be monitored to weed out the fraudulent ones. International collaboration might be required, and red tape raises further barriers to identifying and preventing these transactions in time. Story continues AI\u2019s ability to digest and analyse huge datasets means it can change the outlook for anti-fraud teams, who can now monitor more information than ever before. For example, high street bank TSB has been utilising machine learning to provide every individual transaction with a score based on how likely is to be fraudulent within milliseconds. The bank estimates a 20% reduction in push payment fraud \u2013 where users are convinced to send money to people pretending to be someone else \u2013 as a result of the technology. A human touch is needed here, too \u2013 predictive AI might be able to identify spending patterns and catch fraudulent transactions before they happen, but a human understanding of why a transaction might have taken place in a certain way is necessary to interrogate individual payments on a case-by-case basis. Precision forecasting AI advancements in recent years have enabled huge improvements in financial forecasting. Given the increasingly volatile nature of the competitive landscape, real-time updates to your forecasting can be the difference between getting ahead of the game and being left behind. Machine-learnt algorithms can provide automated forecasting that continuously adapts projections, aggregating massive datasets from a range of sources and in a range of mediums. These can be compared to industry benchmarks or competitor performance to ensure that your firm is on track according to any of your KPIs. And, of course, as time passes and a growing amount of data is entered, the AI\u2019s predictions will become increasingly accurate. When used in this context, it may be able to identify the real driving factors behind a business\u2019 revenue. In one case, a global business found that units sold and sale price, traditional indicators of high revenue, had far less impact on its overall profit and loss than expected. Stuart Wilkie, Head of Commercial Finance at Anglo Scottish, comments: \u201cAs machine learning becomes more and more accurate, there\u2019s essentially no limit to the predictions artificial intelligence may be able to make. \u201cGiven that high-quality predictive AIs are a reasonably new phenomenon, we can expect forecasting to become more accurate, span longer periods and account for a wider range of events as we continue to feed large-scale datasets through it.\u201d Investment insight Given modern AI\u2019s surgical approach to forecasting and its ability to pull from a wide range of different data sources, it\u2019s unsurprising that AI is being used to predict the best-performing stocks to invest in. In fact, a recent study found that 71% of UK investors would trust AI to recommend products for their portfolio \u2013 an 8% rise from 2022. In the US, 45% of investors using tips website The Motley Fool said they\u2019d be comfortable investing based on ChatGPT\u2019s advice and nothing else. Investment advisors can benefit from machine learning tools\u2019 ability to quickly analyse a portfolio and identify areas of risk. In line with identified risk areas, they can design a newly diversified portfolio based on each customer\u2019s strategic goals, choosing the perfect blend of cash and ETF investments. Customer service AI\u2019s ability to handle menial, repetitive queries with greater efficiency than its human counterparts has led to the improvement of customer support chatbots. And, thanks to advancements in natural language processing (NLP), the branch of AI concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and speech in the same way we can, chatbots are providing a better service than ever before. Let\u2019s face it, we\u2019d all rather have a human operative deal with our queries \u2013 but conversational AI is now able to handle simple, one-size-fits-all queries with ease. In the event of a more complex issue, they\u2019ll send you through to a human customer support employee. With 79% of financial services leaders aware that a personalised experience increases customer retention, the use of chatbots for standardised tasks frees up manpower to personally deal with more important issues. The bank benefits from increased efficiency, and the end users benefit from more readily available customer service for complex enquiries. Managing, monitoring and improving AI use Given the speed at which technological advances regarding AI are taking place, it\u2019s important that businesses using AI understand its potential implications. The British government recently hosted the Bletchley Summit , during which 28 governments from around the world \u2013 including China, the EU and the US \u2013 agreed to work together on AI safety research. For now, however, there is little in the way of international legislation. The onus therefore lies with the businesses using AI to manage the way in which they implement it. Long-term strategies are vital in managing AI usage at the corporate level, but as of early 2023, 57% of businesses are currently taking a reactive approach to artificial intelligence. McKinsey, one of the leading adopters of AI at a corporate level, set out a 66-page document in 2021 with a roadmap to the \u201c AI Bank of the Future .\u201d The introduction extolls the importance of \u201cformulating the organisation\u2019s strategic goals for the AI-enabled digital age, and [evaluating] how AI technologies can support these goals.\u201d Wilkie comments: \u201cAI adoption can have an almost instant impact upon a financial organisation\u2019s operating practices, and by proxy, its bottom line. With that in mind, it can be tempting to rush through AI integration at various levels of the business. \u201cHowever, a considered approach is utterly vital. Understanding how AI fits into your firm\u2019s long-term strategy enables deeper interrogation of your AI usage and ultimately leads to safer and more sustainable use of artificial intelligence. By creating a detailed AI strategy, you can also futureproof your business against any legislative changes which will take place in the coming years.\u201d \"How AI is revolutionising commercial finance\" was originally created and published by Leasing Life , a GlobalData owned brand.
