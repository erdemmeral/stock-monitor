Market\u00a0Challenges \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Metallurgical coal is an essential resource in steel production, as it is used to create coke. The cost of metallurgical coal is influenced by global demand for iron and steel, making it more expensive than thermal coal. Prices for metallurgical coal are volatile due to macroeconomic factors, including global steel demand and trading policies of major consumers like China . For instance, India , the world's second-largest crude steel producer and a significant importer of coking coal, experienced a 49% increase in coking coal prices between May and November 2023 . These fluctuations make the market unreliable, with prices reaching as high as USD365 per ton in October 2023 . Despite predictions of falling prices, the value of Australia's metallurgical coal exports is expected to decrease due to these price fluctuations. The volatility of metallurgical coal prices acts as a barrier to market growth. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Metallurgical coal, including bituminous, sub-bituminous, lignite, and coking coal, plays a crucial role in industries like steelmaking and electricity generation. Coking coal's primary use is in steel production, where it transforms into carbon-rich coke during the coking process, essential for iron ore to produce pig iron in the steelmaking process. However, challenges persist. Coal quality factors like caking ability, ash content, volatile matter, sulfur, and phosphorus impact coke production efficiency and steel quality. In electricity generation, non-coking coal is used, but its heating process requires careful consideration due to its lower heating value and higher ash content. Coal classification, based on vitrinite content, helps determine coal's suitability for various uses. Coking coals have high vitrinite content, while non-coking coals have low vitrinity. Metallurgical coke production relies on coal's caking property and plasticity. The steel industry and thermal power plants face a demand-supply gap due to depleting coal reserves and increasing environmental concerns. Coal blending and characterization, including coal washing and coking index determination, are essential to optimize coal usage and improve product quality. Additionally, metallurgical coal is used in producing ferro-chromium, ferro-manganese, carbon electrodes, pesticides, chemical products, carbon fibers, and medicines. The challenges in the metallurgical coal market include ensuring consistent coal quality, managing the supply chain, and addressing environmental concerns.

Changing regulatory standards and increasing regulations on emissions of various pollutants has boosted awareness of environmental concerns among industries like iron & steel. Steel production is an energy-intensive process, and coal is the main energy source NEWARK, Del, Jan. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global iron ore pellets industry is poised for robust growth, with the market value anticipated to reach USD 66.8 billion in 2024 and expand at a CAGR of 6.1% between 2025 and 2035. By 2035, the market is expected to reach USD 128.1 billion, fueled by the surge in demand for high-quality steel and advancements in green steel production. Iron ore pellets, small spherical agglomerates created from iron ore fines, binders, and additives, play an essential role in modern steelmaking. The pellets come in two major grades: blast furnace grade for traditional steel production and Direct Reduction Iron (DRI) grade for eco-friendly steelmaking. These pellets are vital for ensuring superior iron content and reduced impurities, both crucial for high-performance steel used in a variety of applications. The demand for iron ore pellets has seen a steady rise, driven by the growing demand for steel in sectors such as construction, automotive, and infrastructure. As a key ingredient in steel production, iron ore pellets serve as a critical raw material due to their high iron content, which makes them more efficient in the manufacturing process compared to conventional iron ore. Iron ore pellets are produced through a process of pelletizing, which involves agglomerating iron ore fines into small, round balls.

benchmark for sustainable steel production SAN FRANCISCO , Jan. 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Generate Capital , PBC (\"Generate\"), a leading sustainable infrastructure investment firm, is proud to support the construction of an electric arc furnace (EAF) micro-mill, which will significantly reduce the emissions of rebar used in California and nearby states. Generate is providing a $200mm secured loan to Pacific Steel Group (\"PSG\"), a leading reinforced steel contractor in California . Generate Capital logo \"At Generate, we are committed to supporting projects that empower communities while building the infrastructure for a more sustainable future,\" said Bill Sonneborn , President, Generate Capital. \"PSG's innovative approach demonstrates how we can significantly reduce emissions in the industrial sector while meeting the rising demand for greener building materials economically. We're excited to partner with PSG on this transformative project.\u00a0 We're grateful to CalSTRS, HESTA, and the other co-investors who joined Generate through our managed capital vehicles.\" The micro-mill will convert locally sourced steel scrap into high-quality, custom-length steel rebar, a critical material for construction. The project eliminates the need for the roundtrip hauling of scrap and finished steel in and out of California , providing a transportation cost advantage and carbon emissions savings. Leveraging onsite and nearby renewable energy, electrification, carbon capture and storage and a local supply chain, the new mill is expected to produce rebar with 85% fewer emissions compared to traditional methods, setting a new benchmark for sustainable steel production. \"This innovative project aligns with our objective to provide the highest-quality materials while lowering our environmental footprint,\" said Eric Benson , CEO of Pacific Steel Group. \"By eliminating unnecessary transport and utilizing cleaner production methods, we are creating rebar that not only meets our customers' high standards but also supports their sustainability goals. This financing from Generate enables us to take a bold step forward in building the only steel mill in California and one of the greenest steel mills in the country.\" With a global market size estimated at $1.5 trillion in 2023, steel is the most widely used metal in the world. It is also one of the largest single sources of carbon emissions globally, accounting for 7% of global and almost 30% of industrial emissions . Decarbonizing the steel market, therefore, is vital to achieving the transition to net-zero emissions.\u00a0Generate's investment in PSG enables steel production that is both sustainable and cost competitive. The mill will incorporate multi-technology sustainability solutions to lower its emissions and environmental footprint with project economics that eliminate the green premium. Story Continues The loan represents an anchor investment from Generate's strategic credit initiative. This pillar of the business provides structured credit solutions to finance critical assets and companies in the infrastructure and sustainable assets value-chains.

in 2024 PR Newswire Wed, Jan 8, 2025, 4:15 PM 4 min read WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. , Jan. 8, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Emergency Assistance Foundation (EAF) \u2013 a non-profit administrator of disaster and hardship relief funds\u00a0\u2013 is pleased to announce that it provided over $59 million in financial assistance to more than 71,800 people and families in need around the world in 2024. Emergency Assistance Foundation (PRNewsfoto/Emergency Assistance Foundation, Inc.) Much of EAF's work is done through the ongoing administration of its 350+ employee relief funds , each sponsored by a company \u2013 ALDI, American Airlines, Experian, Mattress Firm Inc., Synchrony, Travel + Leisure Co., and Quest Diagnostics\u00ae among them \u2013 to support its team members who are impacted by unforeseen disasters and personal hardships. EAF also often activates its People First Fund when large-scale disasters strike and did so when Hurricanes Helene and Milton devastated the southeastern United States in late 2024. The People First Fund for Hurricanes Helene & Milton enabled donors to maximize their impact and provided direct cash grants to cover self-identified essentials \u2013 from temporary shelter to food and clothing \u2013 in the hurricanes' immediate aftermath, with initial assistance awarded the same day Helene first made landfall in Florida . 2024 Disaster Relief: Through its employee relief funds, EAF responded in real time to dozens of disaster events around the world in 2024. The top five by the amount of financial assistance provided were: 1. Hurricanes Helene and Milton : $20 million to 31,000 people and families 2. Hurricane Beryl : $8 million to 14,000 people and families 3. Israel /Palestine Conflict : $1.8 million to 1,600 people and families With 2023 data included, EAF's response to the Israel /Palestine conflict totals $5 million to 6,100 people and families. 4. Brazil Floods : $376,000 to 580 people and families 5. Jasper Wildfire: $255,000 to 450 people and families \"We know that the best way to provide support in the aftermath of disasters is to put money directly into the hands of the people impacted as quickly as possible, filling a void in traditional disaster response,\" says Doug Stockham , President of Emergency Assistance Foundation. \"We're giving people what they need most in the moment and supporting them on the path to recovery.\" 2024 Personal Hardship Relief: EAF also provides essential financial assistance to eligible people and families impacted by unforeseen personal hardships, from house fires to the loss of a loved one. In 2024, the top five personal hardship categories based on the amount of financial assistance provided were: Story Continues Serious Illness/Injury Death (e.g., funeral costs) Impact to Primary Residence (e.g., fires, floods) Non-Routine Medical Expenses Domestic Violence In October (Domestic Violence Awareness Month), EAF released a Domestic Violence Impact Report demonstrating the profound difference employee relief funds can make for survivors, who often encounter unexpected financial challenges, including the costs of temporary housing, basic necessities, counseling services, and other essentials while they seek safety and rebuild their lives. EAF's employee relief funds are designed to provide critical financial assistance \u2013 totaling over $3 million for domestic violence to date \u2013 during these difficult times. Since its inception, EAF has awarded over $329 million in financial assistance to more than 411,000 people and families impacted by unforeseen disasters and personal hardships.

unfortunately lost 85% over the last three years editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Tue, Jan 7, 2025, 6:17 PM 2 min read In This Article: EAF -2.67% As an investor, mistakes are inevitable. But you have a problem if you face massive losses more than once in a while. So take a moment to sympathize with the long term shareholders of GrafTech International Ltd. ( NYSE:EAF ), who have seen the share price tank a massive 85% over a three year period. That would certainly shake our confidence in the decision to own the stock. Even worse, it's down 15% in about a month, which isn't fun at all. We really feel for shareholders in this scenario. It's a good reminder of the importance of diversification, and it's worth keeping in mind there's more to life than money, anyway. Now let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for GrafTech International To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Over the three years that the share price declined, GrafTech International's earnings per share (EPS) dropped significantly, falling to a loss. Due to the loss, it's not easy to use EPS as a reliable guide to the business. But it's safe to say we'd generally expect the share price to be lower as a result! The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image). NYSE:EAF Earnings Per Share Growth January 7th 2025 It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on GrafTech International's earnings, revenue and cash flow . A Different Perspective Investors in GrafTech International had a tough year, with a total loss of 15%, against a market gain of about 26%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. However, the loss over the last year isn't as bad as the 13% per annum loss investors have suffered over the last half decade. We'd need to see some sustained improvements in the key metrics before we could muster much enthusiasm. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for GrafTech International you should be aware of, and 2 of them are a bit unpleasant. We will like GrafTech International better if we see some big insider buys.

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. And I like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Michael Bennett, investor relations. Please go ahead. Michael Bennett Thank you, Marvin and good morning. I'm Michael Bennett, the company's Vice President of Investor relations. I'm happy to welcome you to Radius Recycling's earnings presentation for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. In addition to today's audio comments, we have issued our press release and posted (technical difficulty), both of which you can access on our website at radiusrecycling.com. Before we start, let me call your attention to the detailed Safe Harbor statement on slide 2, which is also included in our press release and in the company's form 10-Q which will be filed later today. As we note on slide 2, we may make forward-looking statements on our call today. Our actual results may differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in the forward-looking statement is contained in slide 2 as well as our press release today and our form 10-Q. Please note that we will be discussing some non-GAAP measures during our presentation today. We've included a reconciliation of those metrics, the GAAP in the appendix to our slide presentation. Now let me turn the call over to Tamara Lundgren, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. She will host the call today with Stefano Gaggini, our Chief Financial Officer. Tamara Lundgren Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our fiscal '25 first quarter earnings call. On our call this morning, I'll review our quarterly results, the trends affecting our business, and progress on the strategic activities we have underway to address industry dynamics and create long term value through the cycle. Stefano will then provide more detail on our financial performance, our capital investments, and our capital structure. I'll wrap up with some takeaways from our sustainability report that we issued in mid-December and then we'll take your questions. But before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to express our support for those of you who are being impacted or who have family or friends who are being impacted by the wildfires in Southern California. Our thoughts and prayers are with you. Before turning to the next slide, I'd also like to take a moment to recognize our employees for their continued strong safety performance. After delivering safety results in fiscal '24 that were the second best in our company's history, this quarter the team achieved almost a 50% sequential reduction in our total case incident rate. And 97% of our sites experience zero lost time injuries. These strong results reflect our team's engagement and commitment to creating a safe work environment and a sustainable safety culture. Let's turn now to slide 4 to review our first quarter highlights. While market conditions during the quarter were more challenging than a year ago, our year over year operating results remained stable. The difference between our adjusted EPS loss of $1.33 compared to a year ago was primarily due to an income tax detriment associated with our deferred tax assets. The contribution from our recycled metals business improved versus a year ago, driven by benefits realized from our cost reduction and productivity measures implemented in fiscal '24 and stronger non-ferrous demand which offset the tight scrap environment and the softer global ferrous markets. The contribution from finished steel declined year over year due to weaker domestic steel conditions and a scheduled maintenance outage. Our steel mill utilization of 81%, while down sequentially, was still higher than the US average of 75% reflecting relatively stronger West Coast demand. We achieved nearly break-even operating cash flow during the quarter and return capital to our shareholders through our 123rd consecutive quarterly dividend. The biggest headwind to our performance is the pressure us manufacturing sector which has been in recessionary territory for two years. The last time we saw such an extended manufacturing downturn was over 20 years ago. The outlook for a manufacturing recovery, however, is positive with US consumer and business confidence surging since November and a consensus across the political spectrum that revitalizing our manufacturing sector is critical for US economic growth and national security. A recovery in the manufacturing sector should both ease the constrained scrap environment and drive more demand for ferrous and non-ferrous recycled metals. From a long term perspective, the demand for recycled metals continues to have a strong upward bias underpinned by several structural trends. US industrial reshoring continued growth in EAF steelmaking production, maximizing the use of recycled metals and production processes, and the transition to metal intensive low carbon technologies. Importantly, our strategic initiatives focused on metal recovery technologies, volume growth, and expansion of our 3PR services are strongly aligned with the secular growth drivers. So let's turn to slide 5 for a deeper dive into market conditions. During the quarter, export prices for recycled ferrous metals decreased driven by softer global steel demand including the dampening effect from elevated levels of Chinese steel exports. In the last 12 months, through November 2024 Chinese steel exports to countries in Asia, Central and South America, and Turkey have risen by approximately 25% versus a year ago, reducing steel manufacturing and associated ferrous scrap demand in these regions as a result. Domestic ferrous scrap prices during Q1 were relatively flat sequentially but down significantly from a year ago. Finished steel prices also softened during the quarter as purchasers reduced inventory levels heading into the end of the year. While the construction markets were softer due to due to interest rate uncertainty and inflationary pressures on construction costs, the Dodge Momentum Index which is a 12 month leading indicator of non-residential construction spending is signaling strong growth. Moving to non-ferrous, although average non-ferrous prices decrease sequentially, they remain up year over year on healthy global demand for copper and aluminum. One of the most significant drivers of change for our operating margins has been the reduced supply of recycled scrap metal. As the US manufacturing sector has gone through a cyclical downturn, our markets have experienced a tightening in the availability of end-of-life vehicles, obsolete white goods, manufacturing scrap, and scrap from fewer construction and demolition projects. These constrained supply conditions of pressured purchase costs for raw materials leading to margin compression. In addition, auto production that is still below pre pandemic levels, together with financing costs for new and used cars that are still comparatively high have contributed to the average age of vehicles on the road reaching their highest level on record. But while the weaker environment that we're in today presents challenges, we've experienced cyclical downturns and volatility before and we've demonstrated our ability to navigate effectively through these periods by focusing on what we can control including productivity, customer service, technology, and platform diversification. As market conditions recover, we are very well positioned to benefit from the expected increased demand for recycled metals associated with investments in infrastructure, industrial reshoring, growth in US electric arc furnace steelmaking capacity, and the transition to metal intensive low carbon technologies. So let's turn now to slide 6 for an update on our strategic priorities. Our strategic initiatives are strongly aligned with the secular growth trends I mentioned earlier and can be summarized as follows: first, our investments in advanced metal recovery technologies. This is a multi-site, multi-year investment program, focused on increasing the recovery of non-ferrous metals from our shredding process and creating product optionality by enabling us to create furnace-ready products based on demand and price. The majority of the returns from these investments should come through our results in fiscal '25. We estimate these investments should return over $40 million in annual EBITA after full deployment. Second, our trademark 3PR services and solutions business line. Our 3PR service and offering enables our customers to increase their recycling rates, reduce materials going to landfills, lower their carbon footprint, and provide enhanced sustainability reporting. This is an asset light business typically with multi-year contracts that provides a counterbalance to our more cyclical core recycling operations and it's highly aligned with secular growth trends. Reflecting this steady growth, our 3PR business line contributed over 10% to our recycled metal volumes in fiscal '24. Third, our cost reduction and productivity program. In the first quarter, we achieved a 6% reduction in adjusted SG&A costs compared to the prior year, reflecting the cost savings initiatives we implemented during fiscal '24. Additionally, as part of our continued focus on optimizing production efficiencies, we expect in fiscal '25 to benefit from the monetization of certain discrete real estate assets in locations where we can both substantially consolidate or reposition our business activity and unlock the associated real estate value. We expect to close on two transactions in the second half of the year and raised net proceeds of approximately $35 million. Benefits from these initiatives are already contributing to our financial performance. And as the manufacturing sector improves and the global steel market returns to equilibrium, we expect the benefits of our actions to become much more visible in our margins and EBITDA and to provide a substantial boost to the future financial results. So now let me turn the presentation over to Stefano. Story Continues Stefano Gaggini Thank you. Tamara and good morning. On a year over year basis, we were able to achieve stable operating results despite the deterioration in market conditions for ferrous and especially for finished steel over the last 12 months. In addition, last year's results had benefited from insurance recovery gains of $4 million. The contribution to consolidated results from our recycled metals platform improved over this period, driven primarily by stronger non-ferrous demand and by the productivity and cost savings program we implemented over the last year with an aggregate quarterly run rate of benefits of nearly $20 million. This more than offset the impact of the softer global ferrous market. Finished steel contribution was significantly lower as weaker demand and prices led to a 10% compression in metal spreads year over year which was further compounded by higher conversion costs due to lower mill utilization in the first quarter of fiscal '25 including from a scheduled maintenance outage. On a sequential basis, there were two primary drivers of the decline in adjusted the beta performance. First, slightly more than half of the reduction in EBITDA was associated with the decline in sales volumes primarily due to seasonality and to a lesser extent timing of shipments. Ferrous and finished steel volumes each were down 11% and non-ferrous volumes were down 14%. Lower volumes also contributed to margin compression through the loss of operating leverage including at our mill due to the lower utilization. And second, there was a reduction in average net selling prices for our ferrous, non-ferrous, and finished steel products that led to metal spread compression compared to the fourth quarter. The spread compression also included a detriment from volatility in non-ferrous prices during the quarter. Adjusted SG&A expense was down 6% year over year driven by the measures we implemented during fiscal '24 targeting a reduction of 10% in SG&A. It is worth highlighting that our results in the first quarter reflect elevated cost of several million dollars for certain ongoing legal matters which we expect to be temporary and recede in the second half of fiscal '25. Our reported SG&A expense was 10% lower year over year as it benefited from a $2 million insurance recovery gain related to a legacy environmental matter which is excluded from adjusted results. Turning to other ferrous dynamics in the first quarter. The share of domestic ferrous shipments was 43%. Our top sales destinations for ferrous exports were Bangladesh, Turkey, and India. Ferrous average net selling prices were 3% lower sequentially primarily driven by weaker export demand amid continued pressure from elevated levels of Chinese steel exports. Domestic prices were stable during the first quarter. In the lower price environment, the impact of average inventory accounting was a detriment of $1 per ferrous ton in the first quarter, similar to the levels seen in the fourth quarter. Now let's move to slide 8 to discuss non-ferrous sales and provide an update on our non-ferrous investments. Non-ferrous sales volumes were down 14% sequentially, primarily reflecting seasonality on flows and to a lesser extent, timing of sales. On a year-over-year basis, volumes were down 2%. We sold our non-ferrous products to 13 countries with the major export destinations being Malaysia, Thailand, and India. Average net selling prices for our recycled non-ferrous products were down 6% sequentially, reflecting the decline in non-ferrous market prices from the multi-year peak reached earlier in the year. As you can see in the bottom right graph, price volatility for non-ferrous metals was significant in the last six months. Notwithstanding the volatility, prices for non-ferrous products remain at healthy levels as evidenced by the 12% rise in average net selling prices on a year-over-year basis. We continue to progress the deployment of our advanced primary non-ferrous recovery systems, which drive the incremental metal recovery and the majority of the expected contribution from our investments in technology. We advanced our ramp-up activities on several of these primary systems during the quarter. As of the end of the calendar year '24, we have now completed construction and started the commissioning of the last of the currently permitted primary systems. Overall, the contribution to performance from these systems was positive in the first quarter. We continue to expect to see a trend of increasing returns from these investments in the next couple of quarters and target for the substantial full ramp-up of the permitted systems by Q3 of fiscal '25. Once fully operational, we continue to expect substantial returns from our investments of approximately $10 EBITDA per ferrous ton in normal market conditions. Now let's move to slide 9 to discuss our steel mill performance. Finished steel sales volumes of 125,000 tons in the first quarter were down 11% sequentially due primarily to construction seasonality in our Western markets. Compared to the prior year, volumes were down 3%. Average rolling mill utilization was 81%, down from 97% sequentially and from 95% in the prior year, including due to the impact of a scheduled maintenance outage during the first quarter of fiscal '25. Average net selling prices for finished steel were down by 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year as demand in our West Coast market has softened in the elevated interest rate environment. We believe our mill will benefit from the anticipated demand associated with the US infrastructure bill. However, as of yet, this demand has yet to meaningfully come into play in the construction market. Now let's move to slide 10. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was near breakeven, including a modest benefit from working capital from lower volumes and prices and the timing of shipments and collections. We continue to manage and align capital expenditures to current performance trends, and invested $12 million in CapEx in the first quarter. Looking ahead, we now project our fiscal '25 CapEx investments to be around $60 million. Around 20% of the spend will be for growth projects, including investments to support the continued expansion of recycling services and completion of our non-ferrous technology initiatives, with the remaining spend for maintaining the business and environmental-related capital projects. As Tamara mentioned, we expect asset monetization transactions with net proceeds of $35 million to contribute to free cash flow generation in the second half of fiscal '25 subject to customary closing terms. Net debt was $430 million at the end of the first quarter. Our credit facility with a capacity of $800 million and a maturity date of August 2027, carries interest costs that are linked to short-term market rates. As a result, we benefit from the cuts in short-term interest rates by the US Federal Reserve, which have aggregated to 100 basis points since September. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was an expense of 11% on reported pretax results. As mentioned during last quarter's earnings call, because we are in a valuation allowance position on our deferred tax balances, and based on how the underlying mechanics work, our tax rate is subject to significant projection estimates during interim quarterly periods. Therefore, we expect to see meaningful quarter-to-quarter volatility in our tax rate due to changes in those estimates, including from company performance trends, which is what occurred in the first quarter and created a tax expense on a pretax loss. Compared to a year ago, the income tax rate drives the substantial majority of the difference in EPS results. As in the prior year, our tax rate reflected a more normal profile without the impact of a valuation allowance. We do not expect to be a cash taxpayer in fiscal '25, given the availability of net operating loss carryforward. Looking ahead to the next few months, we expect to see typical winter seasonality in our recycling metals and finished steel sales volumes in our second fiscal quarter before spring seasonality in both flows and construction activity kicks in. We also anticipate a meaningful ramp-up in contribution from our technology investments. It will continue to see the benefits from our productivity and cost reduction program, including an abatement of the currently elevated legal cost starting in the second half of the fiscal year. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Tamara. Tamara Lundgren Thank you, Stefano. In mid-December, we issued our 11th Sustainability Report, which describes our progress towards our multiyear sustainability goals. I'll highlight just a few examples, and I encourage you to visit our website to view the report. We reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions at our recycling operations by 30% versus our 2019 baseline. In addition, we maintained 100% net carbon-free electricity usage across our operations for the fourth consecutive year. We are meeting these goals primarily through significant investments in state-of-the-art emissions control systems for metal shutting operations and more efficient operating equipment. These achievements and many others would not have been possible without our employees living our core values of safety, sustainability, and integrity. I'm very proud of what our team has accomplished. During a period marked by challenging market conditions and geopolitical uncertainties, our company's steady progress reflects the agility of our workforce, the resiliency of our culture, and the strength of our platform. We have an exciting year ahead of us as we execute our strategic priorities, and we are well positioned to benefit from the positive structural trends driving increased demand for recycled metals. I'd like to thank our employees for their dedication and our customers, suppliers, and communities for their partnership. And now, Marvin, let's open the call for questions. Question and Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions) Samuel McKinney, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Samuel McKinney Hi, Tamara and Stefano. Good morning. Tamara Lundgren Good morning. Stefano Gaggini Good morning. Samuel McKinney Hey, starting in the export market. The first quarter export ferrous pricing posted its softest quarterly level over the last handful of years. Can you talk about the elevated export level still coming out of China? Any potential relief on that front? And what else you're seeing in the export market? Tamara Lundgren Sure. So as you highlighted and as we mentioned, the Chinese steel overproduction has clearly had a dampening effect on markets around the world, in Asia, in Central and South America, in Turkey, and elsewhere. What we expect is we do expect to see a pullback of this excess production and excess exports from China. We expect to see to pull back because other countries are going to push back on these [cheap] exports that hurt their domestic steel production. We've seen this dynamic before and we have seen how quickly it can turn. So we are anticipating a correction. We can't give you the time, but we do anticipate a correction. Samuel McKinney Okay. And then my next question would be on interest expense. First quarter interest expense was relatively flattish sequentially, but that number rose about $4 million year-over-year. I know a recent amendment to the credit facility has increased your cost of money, but any info you can give us on how you plan to manage the debt and that rising interest expense moving forward? Stefano Gaggini Hi Sam, this is Stefano. So on the first part of your question, the impact of the cost of the amendment to the credit facility that we executed back in June, is now fully reflected in our interest cost profile in Q1 '25. Those were onetime costs that were paid in cash at the time of execution of the amendment. From an accounting perspective, they are amortized interest expense of the remaining life of the facility, which expires in August '27. So at this point, those costs that flow through interest expense are noncash and they were not material to start with. On the second part of your question, obviously, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the interest rates decline that we have seen with a reduction of over -- of [100] basis points since the Fed started cutting the rates back in September, that does and will benefit our interest costs since our line of credit is based on short-term interest rates. And because of the timing of when those reduction occurred, the benefits are only very partially reflected in our fiscal Q1 and will be, therefore, reflected in full in Q2. And overall, from a debt perspective, we have a line of credit, we are capacity of $800 million. We have $430 million at the end of Q1 outstanding. And really, that level of debt is also reflective of the investments we made in the last couple of years and including on the nontariff recovery technologies, where we now expect -- as Tamara mentioned and I mentioned, we expect those returns to expand and have a strong payback. So we view our liquidity from a positive perspective. The path that we're looking forward is clearly improving the potential performance and operating cash flow generation to self-help initiatives or strategic initiatives. And as Tamara just mentioned, expecting market conditions to recover as well. So those are the catalysts we have managed and aligned our CapEx and flex the CapEx to align with cash flow generation we expect $60 million in CapEx spend in FY25. We have asset monetization opportunities. We're already two properties under contract. We expected cash proceeds of $35 million. Those will be supportive of free cash flow generation and the interest cost going lower. So from that perspective, that's the context on the debt interest cost sentence. Samuel McKinney Okay. Thank you. Stefano Gaggini Thank you. Tamara Lundgren Thank you. Operator Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'll now turn it back to Tamara Lundgren for closing remarks. Tamara Lundgren Thank you Marvin and thank you all for your time today. We look forward to speaking with you again when we report our second quarter results in April. In the interim, stay safe and stay well. Operator Thank you for the participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program? You may now disconnect?
