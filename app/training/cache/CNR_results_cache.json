Black Bear Value Partners highlighted stocks like Core Natural Resources, Inc. (NYSE: CNR ) in its Q4 2024 investor letter. In January 2025, Core Natural Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CNR) was established through a merger between Arch Resources and CONSOL Energy. Core Natural Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CNR) engages in the production and distribution of bituminous coal. The one-month return of Core Natural Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CNR) was -5.92%, and its shares gained 1.93% of their value over the last 52 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0On January 24, 2024, Core Natural Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CNR) stock closed at $96.73 per share with a market capitalization of $5.16 billion. Black Bear Value Partners stated the following regarding Core Natural Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CNR) in its Q4 2024 investor letter: \"Core Natural Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CNR): Both ARCH and CEIX were down ~18% during the month of December as fears of retaliatory tariffs (these have a large export component to their businesses), economic slowing and likely tax-loss selling drove the stocks lower. Like our discussion on BLDR, the long-term story remains intact, and we used this as an opportunity to further concentrate our investment. Due to their impending merger neither Company can buy back their stock. Once the merger is complete in Q1 there should be abundant cash to buy back stock. I am generally constructive on the merger as the Companies should be able to realize some modest synergies. My sense is more mergers will be coming to this sector given the depressed prices of the securities.

Returns John Dorfman Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 7:28 PM 4 min read January 27, 2024 (Maple Hill Syndicate) For years, my mentor, David Dreman ( Trades , Portfolio ), invested in Westinghouse Electric Co. The stock was cheap, often selling for about nine times the company's per-share earnings. The stock price marched up nicely, yet the stock stayed cheap, because earnings were rising as fast as the stock price. That's a value investor's dream. Today, Westinghouse is in the dust bin of history, and Dreman is mostly retired. But I long to find today's version of what I call the Westinghouse Effect. Here are a few possible candidates. These six stocks are relatively cheap, and have achieved total returns of more than 500% over the five years through January 23. Core Natural Core Natural Resources Inc. ( NYSE:CNR ), a coal company of all things, has returned 951% over the past five years. Core was formed January 15 of this year by the merger of Consol Energy Inc. and Arch Resources Inc. The 951% figure cited above is for shareholders who originally held Consol. Arch shareholders didn't do badly either: They got between a double and a triple. The great investor Charlie Munger once said that value investors run the risk of holding a melting ice cube. You can make an argument that coal companies are just that. My view is different. Although coal is a highly polluting fuel, it is an important one, and probably for the next decade a necessary one. I like Core's balance sheet. It has more than two dollars in cash for every dollar of debt. Debt is only 13% of the company's net worth. The stock sells for seven times earnings. Build-a-Bear Maybe your young kids had a birthday party sometimes at Build-a-Bear, a store where they can choose a stuffed animal, fill it at a stuffing machine, and buy clothes for it too. Five years ago, Build-a-Bear was in tough shape, and bankruptcy rumors flew. The pandemic had hit the company hard. People stopped going to malls, and all 400 of its stores were closed for a while. Yet, Build-a-Bear Workshop Inc. ( NYSE:BBW ) has achieved a five-year return of 817%. It's an example of the wisdom in mutual-fund legend John Templeton's admonition to buy at the point of maximum pain. Dillard's Who says department stores are dinosaurs? You can't prove it by Dillard's Inc. ( NYSE:DDS ). Its shares have provided a 752% return in the past five years, when most department-store stocks have been flat to down. About a month ago, Fortune magazine ran a feature on the company by Phil Wahba, which pointed out that Dillard's stock has beaten Tesla, Apple and Microsoft over the past four years. He called the chain old fashioned, but noted that service is good and the stores intelligently located. Story Continues The company's service territory is the South and Southwest, the faster-growing part of the U.S. I've recommended the stock several times in this column over the years. Cooper Group Mr. Cooper Group Inc. ( NASDAQ:COOP ) is a mortgage lender and mortgage servicer based in Coppell, Texas. Its five year return: 684%. It's the largest mortgage servicer in the U.S., and that's significant because income from servicing is steadier than that from mortgage origination. The company had a major breach in 2023. Hackers stole personal information on some 15 million customers, including Social Security numbers and bank account numbers. Litigation stemming from the breach is still in progress. Nonetheless, six of the eight analysts who follow the stock recommend it. Abercrombie & Fitch Up 632% in the past five years is Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ( NYSE:ANF ), which sells clothing to teens and young adults. It's shown a profit in 14 of the past 15 years (the exception being pandemic-scarred fiscal 2021). Revenue and earnings growth has accelerated lately. Profit margins have usually been slender (as is typical of clothing retailers) but have improved lately. I like the stock, and have recommended it in this column several times. Riley Exploration The smallest stock I'll discuss today is Riley Exploration Permian Inc. ( REPX ). As its name suggests, it produces oil and gas in west Texas and eastern New Mexico, home of the Permian Basin. It has very little revenue until 2021, but now is up to $407 million revenue in the past four quarters. The stock chart shows a jagged pattern, with a five-year return of 512%. I'd consider the stock speculative. But I like the valuation, which is six times recent earnings and less than five times estimated earnings for 2025.

(collectively with its affiliates, \"Ancora\" or \"we\"), a diversified investment firm that oversees approximately $10 billion in assets, today issued the below open letter to the Board of Directors (the \"Board\") of United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) (\"U.S. Steel\" or the \"Company\") regarding a variety of issues, including the Company\u2019s recently blocked sale to Nippon Steel Corporation (\"Nippon\"). To receive important updates, visit www.MakeUSSteelGreatAgain.com . *** January 27, 2025 United States Steel Corporation 600 Grant Street Pittsburgh, PA 15219 Attn: The Board Dear Members of the Board, Ancora is a growing shareholder of U.S. Steel. As an investment firm with deep roots in the Midwest, we have an affinity for the industrial and logistics companies that collectively form the backbone of America\u2019s economy. We are proud to be investors in companies such as Berry Global Group, Inc., Norfolk Southern Corporation, RB Global, Inc. and now U.S. Steel. Owning these types of businesses enables us to pursue strong risk-adjusted returns while helping support American competitiveness, job creation and wage growth. Although we understand why the Board explored strategic alternatives in 2023, its ultimate decision to ignore national security and pursue a risky sale to Nippon \u2013 an overseas bidder that came in just $1 per share higher than a competing domestic bidder \u2013 has led to a dead end. There appears to be no legal basis and no precedent for U.S. Steel\u2019s costly litigation over the Presidential Executive Order blocking the transaction. Moreover, President Donald Trump is a vocal opponent of the deal and long-term proponent of strengthening America\u2019s domestic manufacturing base. He also has long-held skepticism about foreign direct investment from Japan based on his own business dealings dating back to the 1980s. We see no reason to believe that President Trump, a high-conviction businessman who was elected by middle-class and working-class voters, is going to contradict his self-described \"America First\" agenda and disregard the opposition of the United Steelworkers. Story Continues The Board\u2019s choice to double down on its extremely poor decision to pursue a sale to Nippon has also kept U.S. Steel in a corroded state. Chief Executive Officer David Burritt, who stood to rake in more than $70 million himself if the sale had been consummated, has been allowed to misallocate capital, issue unreliable and overoptimistic forecasts, and repeatedly miss financial targets. It seems the Board failed to keep Mr. Burritt\u2019s attention on efficiency, execution and risk management as steel prices remained depressed over the past year. Rather than finally acknowledge the Company\u2019s perilous trajectory and try to course correct, the Board remains steadfastly committed to an underperforming leader who apparently lacks the ability and vision to bring U.S. Steel back from a busted transaction. In light of these alarming decisions and the unjustifiable deference to Mr. Burritt, who has made clear through outlandish rhetoric that he is self-interested and unfit for leadership, Ancora has nominated nine highly qualified, independent candidates for election to the Board at U.S. Steel\u2019s 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Our slate includes individuals with corporate governance experience, finance expertise, industrials and manufacturing backgrounds, public policy acumen and other qualifications critical to turning around a standalone U.S. Steel. The slate\u2019s plan includes installing Alan Kestenbaum, a steel industry legend who delivered total shareholder returns of more than 450% at Stelco Holdings Inc., as a replacement for Mr. Burritt. We expect the investment community will agree that any steel company would be fortunate to have Mr. Kestenbaum assume such a role. Our slate and Mr. Kestenbaum look forward to ultimately releasing their full plan for enhancing U.S. Steel\u2019s corporate governance, cost structure, labor relations, margins, operations and long-term viability as a force within the American economy. With the tailwind of President Trump\u2019s agenda, including steel tariffs, our nominees are confident they will shift the Company\u2019s strategy from hoping to be saved to implementing a multi-year plan that targets meaningful share price appreciation. The Case for Wholesale Change: The Board Has Doubled Down on its Bad Decision to Pursue a Risky Sale \u2013 Even After the Sale was Blocked by Executive Order We want to take this opportunity to share a few key facts. First and foremost, no transaction blocked by Presidential Executive Order after a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has ever gone through. This means there is no legal precedent for the litigation brought by U.S. Steel and Nippon earlier this month. Although U.S. Steel seems to be holding out hope that it can convince President Trump to approve the deal, the facts indicate that this is a pipe dream. President Trump has repeatedly voiced opposition to the transaction and has long been skeptical of deals with Japanese businesses. 1 In fact, just last month he stated \"I am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company, in this case Nippon Steel of Japan [\u2026] As President, I will block this deal from happening.\" 2 Nothing he has said since former President Joseph Biden\u2019s Executive Order indicates a change of heart. In addition to the aforementioned headwinds, the blocked deal also faced opposition from Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a bipartisan contingent of high-profile lawmakers and the United Steelworkers. When they were in the Senate, Messrs. Vance and Rubio previously co-authored a letter to then-Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen to stress that \"[t]he transaction was not entered into with U.S. national security in mind.\" 3 It should be clear as day that U.S. Steel is now fighting a binding Executive Order, the Trump administration, an array of senators and representatives, and a multitude of third parties that do not buy into Mr. Burritt\u2019s self-serving arguments. The Board should also be aware of what independent and objective legal experts have to say: \"Unfortunately for Nippon Steel, their argument is not particularly strong. The president's action in this case is explicitly excluded from judicial review under U.S. law.\" - Akira Inoue, partner, Baker & McKenzie 4 \"The D.C. Circuit is unlikely to overturn the blocking order based solely on allegations of pre-determination or the appearance of a sham process. Substantial evidence of constitutional violations or procedural defects is normally required. In addition, there does not appear to be a process for taking evidence, so the sham argument cannot be developed beyond what is in the public record.\" - Ken Nunnenkamp, partner, Morgan Lewis 5 \"Nippon and U.S. Steel face a formidable uphill battle in challenging CFIUS' referral and the president's exercise of authority to block the deal on national security grounds. Congress intended to shield CFIUS' decisions, and the president's conclusions under the CFIUS regime, from virtually all judicial review, an approach that is consistent with broad judicial deference to the executive branch on national security matters.\" - Mario Mancuso, George W. Hicks Jr. and Lucille Hague, partners, Kirkland & Ellis 6 It borders on delusional to think that the Trump administration would use precious political capital at the start of its term to reverse its public position on the transaction, not to mention undermine its clearly articulated focus on revitalizing American manufacturing and insourcing. The Case for Wholesale Change: The Board Has Allowed a Conflicted, Underperforming CEO to Hinder U.S. Steel\u2019s Credibility and Undermine the Company\u2019s Future Ancora has a proven track record of correctly identifying companies that are held back by conflicted or unfit CEOs. Before we seek the removal of a CEO, we typically try to work with a board of directors to address and course correct the executive\u2019s shortcomings. In this case, however, we see no future with Mr. Burritt. In our view, Mr. Burritt exhibited disqualifying behavior on January 3 rd , when he issued a statement that called former President Biden\u2019s decision \"shameful and corrupt . \" He continued what appeared to be a tirade by calling highly respected United Steelworkers President David McCall a \" union boss,\" effectively questioning his integrity. 7 We also need to scrutinize the Board\u2019s oversight of Mr. Burritt in light of his public accusation that the prior administration made a decision that supports the Chinese Communist Party. It runs counter to the interests of shareholders, to which Mr. Burritt owes a fiduciary duty, to make seemingly unhinged and retaliatory statements about plans \"to fight President Biden\u2019s political corruption.\" 8 Regardless of political leanings, this is not how standard public company executives act. Perhaps this is why Jeh Johnson, former Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, abruptly resigned from the Board in recent weeks. Since before the sale to Nippon was announced, Mr. Burritt also appears to have diverted his focus from U.S. Steel\u2019s operations. For example, on the conference call for the Nippon sale announcement, analysts noted that Big River\u2019s EBITDA per ton was down roughly 59% and the mini-mill cost per ton was up roughly 23% following the 2021 Big River acquisition. 9 Mr. Burritt\u2019s response to this was tone deaf: \"we feel absolutely wonderful about this Big River facility. And with Big River 2, it's going to be even more remarkable.\" 10 When U.S. Steel reported fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings only six weeks later, it revealed $12 million of costs related to Big River, which had the effect of reducing the mini-mill segment\u2019s EBITDA to just $74 million. 11 Unfortunately for shareholders, the trend of excess costs at Big River has continued unabated. On September 19, 2024, the Company disclosed that the mini-mill segment\u2019s adjusted EBITDA would be lower than the previous quarter, impacted by $40 million of costs from the Big River 2 mini-mill. 12 The Company followed this with a vague cautionary note on December 19, 2024, stating Big River 2 \"ramp-related costs exert pressure on the quarter.\" 13 In addition to unrelenting Big River cost overruns, U.S. Steel has consistently missed earnings estimates over the past year and a half while lagging its peers. Notably, during Mr. Burritt\u2019s tenure, the Company\u2019s total shareholder returns have underperformed peers by a staggering 227.7%. Total Shareholder Returns* 1-year 5-year Burritt CEO Tenure U.S. Steel -7.7% -21.3% 13.5% Peer Median 24.9% 180.6% 241.2% Relative Performance -32.2% -201.9% -227.7% Source: FactSet and Bloomberg.

Mr. Burritt\u2019s election by the Board to assume the CEO role was announced May 10, 2017. Key Performance Metrics** Revenue Growth Adjusted EBITDA Growth CapEx Growth Free Cash Flow Growth U.S. Steel 19.7% -25.6% 336.6%*** -225.7% Peer Median 38.3% 15.5% 79.2% 55.0% Relative Performance -18.6% -41.1% 257.4% -280.7% **Key performance metrics measured from figures reported by U.S. Steel and peers from Q2 2021 to Q3 2024. These dates reflect the start of the economic recovery from COVID and the most recently reported quarter. ***CapEx Growth is based on incurred expenses and likely does not yet reflect U.S. Steel's $600 million budget expansion for Big River 2. U.S. Steel is now in a dire state due to its excessive capital spending, high debt, soft earnings and nonexistent contingency plan. While Mr. Burritt may not care due to what seem to be his jet-setting ways, we believe the city of Pittsburgh and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have been put at economic risk by his sale aspirations and mismanagement of the Company. There are consequences associated with having out-of-touch leadership with weak involvement in local communities. Absent a miracle, Ancora believes a substantial and urgent reconstitution of the Company\u2019s leadership is necessary. An Alternative Path Forward: Our Slate and Mr. Kestenbaum Want to Make U.S. Steel Great Again in the Public Market Ancora has nominated a fit-for-purpose slate with nine highly qualified individuals, whose complementary skills make them greater than the sum of their parts. Each is a leader in his or her respective field and is able to draw on prior public company experience to help set a viable go-forward strategy. Our nominees include individuals with experience in corporate governance, executive leadership, finance, logistics, manufacturing, regulatory affairs and strategic transactions. They come to the Board free of the incumbents\u2019 past mistakes, open-minded, and committed to producing enduring value for shareholders and stakeholders. Importantly, the slate includes industry heavyweight Alan Kestenbaum, the former Chairman and CEO of Stelco, as a CEO candidate for U.S. Steel. If our slate\u2019s campaign is successful, Mr. Kestenbaum will bring to the role a uniquely close relationship with the United Steelworkers, expertise in identifying and operating undervalued assets, and an unrelenting commitment to delivering the best possible results. Most notably, Mr. Kestenbaum has a history of turning U.S. Steel\u2019s failed endeavors into home runs. Look no further than what he accomplished at Stelco, a company U.S. Steel put into bankruptcy. Mr. Kestenbaum acquired Stelco for approximately $53 million, only to later sell it for more than $2 billion. 14 In the process, he enriched his shareholders through the success of a turnaround, whereas U.S. Steel\u2019s investors received virtually nothing for the asset. Considering the significant underperformance of U.S. Steel\u2019s operations and Mr. Burritt\u2019s underwhelming results as a leader, Mr. Kestenbaum represents a massive upgrade on all fronts. If elected, our slate and its CEO candidate are committed to the following: Pursuing the $565 million breakup fee that U.S. Steel needs based on Mr. Burritt\u2019s own statements regarding the prospect of potential facility closures and layoffs. Immediately ending the current Board\u2019s spending spree on Wall Street advisors, which we estimate to be a nine-figure sum over the past 18 months. Revamping the executive leadership team to be full of operators residing near facilities and plants. Restoring relations with labor union members and leaders, community organizations and elected officials. Releasing a clear standalone strategy so investors have transparency about priorities for capital allocation, operations and production, and other commercial initiatives. Protecting Mon Valley Works and other facilities Mr. Burritt has threatened to close. It\u2019s important to highlight that Mr. Kestenbaum\u2019s track record as a CEO includes increasing employment everywhere he has been. Not soliciting acquisition proposals from Cleveland-Cliffs, Inc. or any other partner (domestic or foreign). Please note that despite the sale to Nippon being blocked this month, you \u2013 the Board \u2013 decided to keep a January deadline for director candidate nominations in an apparent effort to insulate yourselves. We complied with your deadline despite being in the process of amassing a meaningful stake that will be disclosed in due course. Make no mistake, Ancora, as well as Mr. Kestenbaum, intend to build meaningful positions as sale pipe dreams fade and the Company\u2019s share price continues resetting from what have been artificially inflated levels. In closing, our goal here is straightforward: make U.S. Steel great again for the benefit of employees, customers, shareholders and all other stakeholders who want a bright future for this American icon. Only under a new Board and management team do we believe this is possible. Regards, Fredrick D.

Coal Player \u2013 Here\u2019s Why Syeda Seirut Javed Sat, Jan 25, 2025, 11:04 PM 5 min read We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Recently Shed Light on These 9 Stocks . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Core Natural Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CNR) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer recently highlighted. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently discussed a possible looming energy crisis in the U.S. that has taken many by surprise. He warned that if the country doesn\u2019t act swiftly, it will soon be overwhelmed by an energy shortfall. According to Cramer, we need to tap into every available energy source including natural gas, wind, geothermal, and hydroelectric power. However, he stressed that the most critical energy source right now is nuclear power. He added: \u201cCrisis comes down to the fact that we had no real industrial growth in this country for decades so we haven\u2019t had to build much energy infrastructure. Now all of a sudden these data centers start coming online like the ones that will be part of Stargate, the Oracle, SoftBank, OpenAI project\u2026 And these data centers consume insane amounts of electricity. It\u2019s a level of demand that nobody saw coming. So after years where we spent more time decommissioning power plants and building new ones, we suddenly gotta go back into growth mode.\u201d READ ALSO: 8 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar and Jim Cramer Discussed 9 Stocks for This Week\u2019s Game Plan Cramer went on to discuss an energy source that many are reluctant to consider: coal. While it may seem counterintuitive, he argued that coal could make a comeback in the U.S. energy mix. \u201cWhen the president gave his inaugural address on Monday, he declared a national emergency aiming to produce more domestic fossil fuels, including coal. Once the mainstay utility fuel, coal has been phased out year after year after year because it is terrible for the environment. 10 years ago, coal-based fuel was responsible [for] about 33% of electricity. Now it\u2019s fallen to 15%.\u201d Yet, with the push to decommission nuclear plants, and the rising cost of natural gas, Cramer suggested that coal might need to be reintegrated into the energy mix. He argued that, despite the environmental drawbacks, the demand for power is now so great that coal\u2019s long decline could be nearing its end. \u201cUnder this president, coal could have\u2026 a renaissance. Sure, coal\u2019s time has come and gone, but it will come again because the data center inspired energy crisis really is so pressing that there\u2019s not really a choice anymore. Yes, the demand is that great, [and] we so foolishly mothballed good nuke plants that it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if coal\u2019s long decline may have finally run its course.\u201d Story Continues Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 9 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the recent episode of Mad Money on January 22. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ( see more details here ). Core Natural Resources, Inc. (CNR): Jim Considers It a Strategic Coal Player \u2013 Here\u2019s Why Pixabay/Public Domain Core Natural Resources, Inc. (NYSE: CNR ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: N/A Discussing Core Natural Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CNR) during Mad Money\u2019s episode, Cramer said: \u201c\u2026 Who\u2019s the winner? It\u2019s hard as the coal cohort is made up of companies that mine coal for steel production and others that mine coal for utilities. But the latter has been such a dog for so long that the US companies have tried to merge their way into steel making coal and to lessen exposure in utilities. Peabody Energy and Core Natural Resources are the big ones. I think they\u2019re cheap, but they trade more like steel companies than coal companies.\u201d Core Natural Resources (NYSE:CNR) focuses on producing and selling bituminous coal, primarily for power generation, industrial, and metallurgical uses. The company also offers coal export terminal services through the Port of Baltimore. Bloomberg recently reported that shares of U.S. coal producers saw an increase following comments by President Donald Trump during a video address at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Core Natural Resources (NYSE:CNR) stock saw a rise of around 2% after the address. In his address, Trump emphasized his commitment to reshaping U.S. energy policy with greater emphasis on oil and natural gas, while also expressing strong support for coal. He declared, \u201cNothing can destroy coal. Not the weather, not a bomb,\u201d calling it \u201ca great backup\u201d as a power source. Overall, CNR ranks 9th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer recently highlighted. While we acknowledge the potential of CNR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.
