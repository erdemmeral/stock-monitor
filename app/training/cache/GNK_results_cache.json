min read In This Article: STNG +0.69% KEX -1.84% Q3 Earnings Highlights: Scorpio Tankers (NYSE:STNG) Vs The Rest Of The Marine Transportation Stocks Let\u2019s dig into the relative performance of Scorpio Tankers (NYSE:STNG) and its peers as we unravel the now-completed Q3 marine transportation earnings season. The growth of e-commerce and global trade continues to drive demand for shipping services, presenting opportunities for marine transportation companies. While ocean freight is more fuel efficient and therefore cheaper than its air and ground counterparts, it results in slower delivery times, presenting a trade off. To improve transit speeds, the industry continues to invest in digitization to optimize fleets and routes. However, marine transportation companies are still at the whim of economic cycles. Consumer spending, for example, can greatly impact the demand for these companies\u2019 offerings while fuel costs can influence profit margins. Geopolitical tensions can also affect access to trade routes, and if certain countries are banned from using passageways like the Panama Canal, costs can spiral out of control.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 5 Quality Compounder Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

changes in the operating and development portfolio ENEFIT GREEN AS Wed, Jan 8, 2025, 10:00 AM 1 min read In This Article: EGR1T.TL +0.15% ENEFIT GREEN AS Having assessed the situation on its core markets, the fit of the company's near-term development portfolio and the existing operating portfolio with the current market situation, as well as financing opportunities, the Management Board of Enefit Green has decided to look for opportunities to exit the Finnish market and sell some non-strategic development projects provided the availability of suitable offers. In the further development of Enefit Green, the Management Board aims to focus on larger wind and hybrid park projects in its core markets in the Baltics and Poland. In order to support these changes, Enefit Green has engaged the Norwegian investment bank Arctic Securities AS to find potential buyers for the 72 MW Tolpanvaara wind farm in Finland and partners for the construction of the 150 MW Kelm\u0117 III wind farm in Lithuania.

Mashaid Ahmed Sat, Dec 28, 2024, 6:18 PM 5 min read In This Article: GNK -2.42% We recently published a list of the 10 Best Marine Shipping Stocks to Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Genco Shipping & Trading Limited (NYSE: GNK ) stands against the other best marine shipping stocks to buy according to analysts. Marine shipping is a critical component of the global economy, responsible for transporting approximately 80% of the world\u2019s trade by volume. This industry serves as the backbone of international commerce by facilitating the movement of raw materials, manufactured goods, and energy resources across continents. The maritime shipping industry continues to face significant challenges as geopolitical tensions and security threats escalate in key shipping routes. Shipping companies have been forced to reconsider their routes, with many opting to divert vessels around the Cape of Good Hope, significantly increasing fuel costs and delivery times. These disruptions have far-reaching economic consequences, affecting supply chains and global trade. Years of Challenges In an interview with CNBC on November 27, Adrian Beciri, CEO of Ducat Maritime said that marine shipping has faced a series of setbacks over the years, including the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, hyperinflation, manpower shortages, and the aftermath of conflicts such as the war in Ukraine and tensions in the Middle East, including the blockage of the Suez Canal. These events have compounded the issues within the marine shipping sector and continue to affect the industry. Beciri highlighted the intrinsic difficulties of the shipping sector, particularly the demanding nature of the work, coupled with economic challenges that have contributed to a labor shortage in the shipping industry, a problem that is often overlooked by the broader market. The CEO also expressed concerns about the potential impact of the president-elect\u2019s announcement of new tariffs on several countries, which could further complicate supply chains and necessitate a shift towards regional or zonal trading blocks. Such a shift could disrupt the historical patterns of international trade, which are based on the comparative advantages of large nations and the principles of free trade. Looking ahead, Beciri emphasized the importance of stable and consistent markets and policies to foster long-term investments and adjustments within the industry. He called for a conducive environment that would allow firms to make significant investments. Despite the mounting challenges faced by the maritime shipping industry, it remains an indispensable pillar of global trade. Story Continues Is Genco Shipping & Trading Limited (GNK) One of The Best Marine Shipping Stocks to Buy According to Analysts? A close-up of a large cargo vessel in the open sea, its sails billowing in the wind. Our Methodology To compile our list of the 10 best marine shipping stocks to buy according to analysts, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find marine shipping companies with a market cap of over $500 million as of December 24. From that list, we narrowed our choices to 10 stocks that analysts see the most upside to. We also included the number of hedge fund holders for these companies, which was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s Hedge Fund database as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of analysts\u2019 average upside potential, as of December 24. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ( see more details here ). Genco Shipping & Trading Limited (NYSE: GNK ) Upside Potential: 66.45% Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 22 Stock Price as of December 24: $14.04 Genco Shipping & Trading Limited (NYSE:GNK) is a leading dry bulk shipping company, operating a diversified fleet of vessels to transport major bulk commodities such as iron ore, coal, and grains globally. Genco Shipping & Trading Limited (NYSE:GNK) is actively pursuing a fleet growth and renewal strategy to enhance its earnings power and operational efficiency. In Q3, the company acquired a 2016-built Capesize vessel, marking its third such acquisition in the past 12 months. These strategic acquisitions are part of a broader plan to modernize the fleet by replacing older, less efficient vessels with high-quality, fuel-efficient ships. By doing so, Genco Shipping & Trading Limited (NYSE:GNK) has added premium high-specification assets to the fleet and has realized dry dock capital expenditure savings of $13 million in 2024 and 2025. Despite recent volatility in the dry bulk market, Genco Shipping & Trading Limited (NYSE:GNK) remains optimistic about the industry\u2019s long-term fundamentals. The company expects to benefit from the growing long-haul ton-mile developments in the iron ore and bauxite trade. Specifically, the Simandou iron ore project in West Africa is on track to begin production in late 2025. The expansion of bauxite and iron ore production in West Africa, along with incremental production growth from Vale, are positive catalysts for the Capesize segment. These developments are particularly significant given the origins of these export volumes, as these routes have three times the ton-mile impact of Australia to China cargoes. Overall, GNK ranks 6th on our list of best marine shipping stocks to buy according to analysts.

Buy Instead Anthony Lee Tue, Dec 24, 2024, 12:02 PM 3 min read In This Article: GNK -2.42% 3 Reasons to Sell GNK and 1 Stock to Buy Instead Genco\u2019s stock price has taken a beating over the past six months, shedding 33.3% of its value and falling to $14.04 per share. This may have investors wondering how to approach the situation. Is there a buying opportunity in Genco, or does it present a risk to your portfolio? Get the full breakdown from our expert analysts, it\u2019s free . Despite the more favorable entry price, we don't have much confidence in Genco. Here are three reasons why GNK doesn't excite us and a stock we'd rather own. Why Is Genco Not Exciting? Headquartered in NYC, Genco (NYSE:GNK) is a shipping company that transports dry bulk cargo along worldwide maritime routes. 1. Long-Term Revenue Growth Disappoints A company\u2019s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. While any business can experience short-term success, top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Regrettably, Genco\u2019s sales grew at a tepid 5.5% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This was below our standard for the industrials sector. Genco Quarterly Revenue 2. Weak Growth in owned vessels Points to Soft Demand Revenue growth can be broken down into changes in price and volume (for companies like Genco, our preferred volume metric is owned vessels). While both are important, the latter is the most critical to analyze because prices have a ceiling. Genco\u2019s owned vessels came in at 42 in the latest quarter, and over the last two years, averaged 2.2% year-on-year growth. This performance was underwhelming and suggests it might have to lower prices or invest in product improvements to accelerate growth, factors that can hinder near-term profitability. Genco Owned Vessels 3. EPS Took a Dip Over the Last Two Years While long-term earnings trends give us the big picture, we also track EPS over a shorter period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business. Sadly for Genco, its EPS declined by more than its revenue over the last two years, dropping 41.4%. This tells us the company struggled to adjust to shrinking demand. Genco Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) Final Judgment Genco isn\u2019t a terrible business, but it isn\u2019t one of our picks. Following the recent decline, the stock trades at 7.5\u00d7 forward price-to-earnings (or $14.04 per share). While this valuation is reasonable, we don\u2019t really see a big opportunity at the moment. We're pretty confident there are more exciting stocks to buy at the moment. We\u2019d recommend looking at Chipotle, which surprisingly still has a long runway for growth . Stocks We Like More Than Genco With rates dropping, inflation stabilizing, and the elections in the rearview mirror, all signs point to the start of a new bull run - and we\u2019re laser-focused on finding the best stocks for this upcoming cycle.

Consumer spending, for example, can greatly impact the demand for these companies\u2019 offerings while fuel costs can influence profit margins.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Hidden Gem Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Kirby (NYSE:KEX) Impresses Adam Hejl Mon, Dec 30, 2024, 12:04 PM 5 min read In This Article: KEX -1.84% STNG +0.69% MATX -3.86% Q3 Marine Transportation Earnings: Kirby (NYSE:KEX) Impresses Looking back on marine transportation stocks\u2019 Q3 earnings, we examine this quarter\u2019s best and worst performers, including Kirby (NYSE:KEX) and its peers. The growth of e-commerce and global trade continues to drive demand for shipping services, presenting opportunities for marine transportation companies. While ocean freight is more fuel efficient and therefore cheaper than its air and ground counterparts, it results in slower delivery times, presenting a trade off. To improve transit speeds, the industry continues to invest in digitization to optimize fleets and routes. However, marine transportation companies are still at the whim of economic cycles. Consumer spending, for example, can greatly impact the demand for these companies\u2019 offerings while fuel costs can influence profit margins. Geopolitical tensions can also affect access to trade routes, and if certain countries are banned from using passageways like the Panama Canal, costs can spiral out of control. The 5 marine transportation stocks we track reported a slower Q3. As a group, revenues missed analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 0.7%. Amidst this news, share prices of the companies have had a rough stretch. On average, they are down 15% since the latest earnings results.

David Grzebinski, Kirby\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, commented, \u201cOur third quarter results reflected steady market fundamentals in both marine transportation and distribution and services, even though we experienced some modest weather and navigational challenges for marine and continued supply challenges in distribution and services. These headwinds were mostly offset by good execution in both marine and distribution and services during the quarter that led to strong financial performance, with total revenues up 9% and earnings per share up 48% year-over-year.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 5 Quality Compounder Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $49.11 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.

Consumer spending, for example, can greatly impact the demand for these companies\u2019 offerings while fuel costs can influence profit margins. Geopolitical tensions can also affect access to trade routes, and if certain countries are banned from using passageways like the Panama Canal, costs can spiral out of control.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% in November), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by potential trade policy changes and corporate tax discussions, which could impact business confidence and growth. The path forward holds both optimism and caution as new policies take shape. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Hidden Gem Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Sales Jabin Bastian Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 1:23 AM 7 min read In This Article: GNK -2.42% Genco (NYSE:GNK) Surprises With Q3 Sales Maritime shipping company Genco (NYSE:GNK) reported Q3 CY2024 results beating Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations , with sales up 105% year on year to $99.33 million. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.41 per share was in line with analysts\u2019 consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Genco? Find out in our full research report . Genco (GNK) Q3 CY2024 Highlights: Revenue: $99.33 million vs analyst estimates of $73.59 million (35% beat) Adjusted EPS: $0.41 vs analyst expectations of $0.41 (in line) EBITDA: $36.92 million vs analyst estimates of $37.48 million (1.5% miss) Gross Margin (GAAP): 46.6%, up from 44.7% in the same quarter last year Operating Margin: 24.2%, up from -62.7% in the same quarter last year EBITDA Margin: 37.2%, up from 30.1% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 30.9%, up from 25.8% in the same quarter last year owned vessels: 42, up 1 year on year Market Capitalization: $700.8 million John C. Wobensmith, Chief Executive Officer, commented, \u201cExecution of our value strategy was once again strong. We enhanced our dividend policy to increase cash distributions to shareholders, resulting in an 18% increase in our third quarter dividend over the prior quarter. Returning significant capital to shareholders remains a top priority for management and we have now declared 21 consecutive dividends, representing $6.315 per share, or ~40% of our current share price. Advancing our growth strategy also remains an important focus for management and subsequent to quarter\u2019s end, we took delivery of another high specification Capesize vessel. Including this acquisition, we have now invested ~$285 million in fleet expansion and modernization since the implementation of our value strategy. Consistent with our stated objective, we are pleased to have reinvested proceeds from the sales of older, less fuel-efficient vessels into this high-quality Capesize vessel to further increase our earnings power and modernize our fleet.\u201d Company Overview Headquartered in NYC, Genco (NYSE:GNK) is a shipping company that transports dry bulk cargo along worldwide maritime routes. Marine Transportation The growth of e-commerce and global trade continues to drive demand for shipping services, presenting opportunities for marine transportation companies. While ocean freight is more fuel efficient and therefore cheaper than its air and ground counterparts, it results in slower delivery times, presenting a trade off. To improve transit speeds, the industry continues to invest in digitization to optimize fleets and routes. However, marine transportation companies are still at the whim of economic cycles. Consumer spending, for example, can greatly impact the demand for these companies\u2019 offerings while fuel costs can influence profit margins. Geopolitical tensions can also affect access to trade routes, and if certain countries are banned from using passageways like the Panama Canal, costs can spiral out of control. Story Continues Sales Growth Examining a company\u2019s long-term performance can provide clues about its business quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Over the last five years, Genco grew its sales at a mediocre 7.4% compounded annual growth rate. This shows it couldn\u2019t expand in any major way, a tough starting point for our analysis. Genco Total Revenue Long-term growth is the most important, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss new industry trends or demand cycles. Genco\u2019s history shows it grew in the past but relinquished its gains over the last two years, as its revenue fell by 14.1% annually. Genco isn\u2019t alone in its struggles as the Marine Transportation industry experienced a cyclical downturn, with many similar businesses seeing lower sales at this time. Genco Year-On-Year Revenue Growth We can better understand the company\u2019s revenue dynamics by analyzing its number of owned vessels, which reached 42 in the latest quarter. Over the last two years, Genco\u2019s owned vessels averaged 2.8% year-on-year growth. Because this number is higher than its revenue growth during the same period, we can see the company\u2019s monetization has fallen. Genco owned vessels This quarter, Genco reported magnificent year-on-year revenue growth of 105%, and its $99.33 million of revenue beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 35%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to decline 12.7% over the next 12 months. Although this projection is better than its two-year trend it's tough to feel optimistic about a company facing demand difficulties. When a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares. Click here to claim your Special Free Report on a fallen angel growth story that is already recovering from a setback . Operating Margin Genco has been a well-oiled machine over the last five years. It demonstrated elite profitability for an industrials business, boasting an average operating margin of 15.7%. This result isn\u2019t surprising as its high gross margin gives it a favorable starting point. Analyzing the trend in its profitability, Genco\u2019s annual operating margin rose by 91.7 percentage points over the last five years, showing its efficiency has meaningfully improved. Genco Operating Margin (GAAP) In Q3, Genco generated an operating profit margin of 24.2%, up 86.9 percentage points year on year. The increase was solid, and since its operating margin rose more than its gross margin, we can infer it was recently more efficient with expenses such as marketing, R&D, and administrative overhead. Earnings Per Share We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company\u2019s growth was profitable. Genco\u2019s full-year EPS flipped from negative to positive over the last five years. This is encouraging and shows it\u2019s at a critical moment in its life. Genco Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can give insight into an emerging theme or development for the business. Sadly for Genco, its EPS declined by more than its revenue over the last two years, dropping 41.5%. This tells us the company struggled because its fixed cost base made it difficult to adjust to shrinking demand. Diving into the nuances of Genco\u2019s earnings can give us a better understanding of its performance. While we mentioned earlier that Genco\u2019s operating margin improved this quarter, a two-year view shows its margin has declined by 23.1 percentage pointswhile its share count has grown 1.8%. This means the company not only became less efficient with its operating expenses but also diluted its shareholders. Genco Diluted Shares Outstanding In Q3, Genco reported EPS at $0.41, up from negative $0.09 in the same quarter last year. This print was close to analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Genco\u2019s full-year EPS of $1.73 to grow by 7.6%. Key Takeaways from Genco\u2019s Q3 Results We were impressed by how significantly Genco blew past analysts\u2019 revenue expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its EBITDA missed. Overall, this quarter was mixed. The stock remained flat at $16.83 immediately following the results. Genco had an encouraging quarter, but one earnings result doesn\u2019t necessarily make the stock a buy. Let\u2019s see if this is a good investment. We think that the latest quarter is just one piece of the longer-term business quality puzzle. Quality, when combined with valuation, can help determine if the stock is a buy.

Not Make Sense To Buy Genco Shipping & Trading Limited (NYSE:GNK) For Its Upcoming Dividend editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Wed, Nov 13, 2024, 1:56 PM 4 min read In This Article: GNK -2.42% Genco Shipping & Trading Limited ( NYSE:GNK ) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Therefore, if you purchase Genco Shipping & Trading's shares on or after the 18th of November, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 25th of November. The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.40 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$0.86 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Genco Shipping & Trading has a trailing yield of 4.9% on the current share price of US$17.64. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! As a result, readers should always check whether Genco Shipping & Trading has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. See our latest analysis for Genco Shipping & Trading Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Genco Shipping & Trading paid out 98% of its earnings, which is more than we're comfortable with, unless there are mitigating circumstances. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Genco Shipping & Trading generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Over the past year it paid out 136% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is uncomfortably high. We're curious about why the company paid out more cash than it generated last year, since this can be one of the early signs that a dividend may be unsustainable. As Genco Shipping & Trading's dividend was not well covered by either earnings or cash flow, we would be concerned that this dividend could be at risk over the long term. Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends. NYSE:GNK Historic Dividend November 13th 2024 Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing? Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's comforting to see Genco Shipping & Trading's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 41% per annum for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing rapidly, but the company is paying out an uncomfortably high percentage of its earnings as dividends. Generally, when a company is growing this quickly and paying out all of its earnings as dividends, it can suggest either that the company is borrowing heavily to fund its growth, or that earnings growth is likely to slow due to lack of reinvestment. Story Continues The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Genco Shipping & Trading has delivered an average of 4.2% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past five years of dividend payments. It's good to see both earnings and the dividend have improved - although the former has been rising much quicker than the latter, possibly due to the company reinvesting more of its profits in growth. To Sum It Up From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Genco Shipping & Trading? Earnings per share have been growing, despite the company paying out a concerningly high percentage of its earnings and cashflow. We struggle to see how a company paying out so much of its earnings and cash flow will be able to sustain its dividend in a downturn, or reinvest enough into its business to continue growing earnings without borrowing heavily. It's not an attractive combination from a dividend perspective, and we're inclined to pass on this one for the time being. With that in mind though, if the poor dividend characteristics of Genco Shipping & Trading don't faze you, it's worth being mindful of the risks involved with this business. Be aware that Genco Shipping & Trading is showing 2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those is a bit concerning... Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers. Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE:GNK) Shareholders Will Receive A Bigger Dividend Than Last Year editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sun, Nov 10, 2024, 4:40 PM 3 min read In This Article: GNK -2.42% Genco Shipping & Trading Limited ( NYSE:GNK ) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 25th of November to $0.40. Despite this raise, the dividend yield of 4.9% is only a modest boost to shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Genco Shipping & Trading Genco Shipping & Trading's Projected Earnings Seem Likely To Cover Future Distributions If it is predictable over a long period, even low dividend yields can be attractive. Before making this announcement, the company's dividend was higher than its profits, and made up 88% of cash flows. While the cash payout ratio isn't necessarily a cause for concern, the company is probably focusing more on returning cash to shareholders than growing the business. Earnings per share is forecast to rise by 48.0% over the next year. If recent patterns in the dividend continues, the payout ratio in 12 months could be 87% which is a bit high but can definitely be sustainable. NYSE:GNK Historic Dividend November 10th 2024 Genco Shipping & Trading's Dividend Has Lacked Consistency Genco Shipping & Trading has been paying dividends for a while, but the track record isn't stellar. This suggests that the dividend might not be the most reliable. Since 2019, the annual payment back then was $0.70, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.86. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 4.2% over that duration. Modest growth in the dividend is good to see, but we think this is offset by historical cuts to the payments. It is hard to live on a dividend income if the company's earnings are not consistent. Genco Shipping & Trading's Dividend Might Lack Growth Given that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. We are encouraged to see that Genco Shipping & Trading has grown earnings per share at 41% per year over the past five years. EPS has been growing well, but Genco Shipping & Trading has been paying out a massive proportion of its earnings, which can make the dividend tough to maintain. The Dividend Could Prove To Be Unreliable Overall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Genco Shipping & Trading will make a great income stock. Strong earnings growth means Genco Shipping & Trading has the potential to be a good dividend stock in the future, despite the current payments being at elevated levels. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income. Story Continues Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

progression of neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), today announced that groundbreaking findings on a potential precision medicine strategy for ALS with GeNeuro\u2019s GNK-301 were presented at the 35th International Symposium on ALS/MND, taking place in Montreal, Canada, from December 6-8, 2024. The presentation was delivered by Dr. Darshan Pandya, from National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)/National Institutes of Health (NIH). The research, led by GeNeuro, through its Lyon R&D unit GeNeuro Innovation SAS, in collaboration with leading institutions, including the NIH/NINDS, ERBC (France), and the University of Oxford (UK), highlights the potential of GeNeuro\u2019s GNK-301, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting HERV-K ENV, a neurotoxic protein that is often found in the cerebrospinal fluid of ALS patients. This protein has been shown to contribute to neuronal cell death and blood-brain barrier dysfunction, two hallmarks of ALS. Preclinical studies have shown that GNK-301 can be used to detect the presence of the HERV-K ENV protein in a laboratory test and that it can then be used as a medicine to neutralize the harmful effects of HERV-K ENV, protecting neurons and preventing damage to the blood-brain barrier. By being able to detect this toxic protein in ALS patients and starting a neutralising treatment early, GeNeuro is proposing a new precision medicine approach that offers hope for transforming the treatment of ALS. \" We are excited to share these promising findings and congratulate the NIH/NINDS, ERBC and the University of Oxford for this exciting new data that opens a path towards a novel precision medicine approach in the treatment of sporadic ALS \", said Herv\u00e9 Perron, CSO of GeNeuro . About GNK-301 and HERV-K ENV Studies have shown that the HERV-K ENV protein acts as a neurotoxin, contributing to neuronal cell death and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction\u2014two hallmarks of ALS pathology. In the laboratory, a test with GNK-301 is able to confirm the presence of HERV-K ENV in samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of ALS patients and, as a consequence, identify those who would benefit from its administration as a medicine. As a neutralizing monoclonal antibody-based medicine, GNK-301 abolishes the ALS CSF neurotoxicity in iPSC-derived neuron cultures and the neuronal death in mice that had been stereotaxically injected with HERV-K ENV. Surprisingly, when present in the brain, the HERV-K ENV protein reproduced the previously reported BBB dysfunction observed in ALS brains, which was also prevented by GNK-301. In animal facilities of ERBC-Voxcan (France), when labelled GNK-301 was injected intravenously in mice, it was found only to accumulate in parts of the brain where HERV-K ENV protein was present. It is of note that there have been previous studies supporting the use of GNK-301 as a medicine: individuals with ALS who make their own endogenous autoantibodies against HERV-K ENV live for longer. However, GNK-301, compared to autoantibodies, has the huge advantage of displaying a much greater affinity and neutralizing effect. In addition, the observed effect of this endogenous neurotoxin on the BBB helps to facilitate the transport of the antibody into brain tissue after its intravenous administration. Further preclinical studies are being conducted, but planning for the required medical grade production of GNK-301 is underway to provide the antibody for clinical studies in ALS patients who will have tested positive for HERV-K ENV with GeNeuro\u2019s dedicated immunoassay. This would be the first integrated strategy for precision medicine in sporadic ALS.

Announces Q3 2024 Financial Results Genco Shipping & Trading Limited Thu, Nov 7, 2024, 12:30 AM 38 min read In This Article: GNK -2.42% Genco Shipping & Trading Limited Declares Dividend of $0.40 per share for Q3 2024; Represents Genco\u2019s 21st Consecutive Quarterly Dividend Totaling $6.315 Per Share NEW YORK, Nov. 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Genco Shipping & Trading Limited (NYSE:GNK) (\u201cGenco\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), the largest U.S. headquartered drybulk shipowner focused on the global transportation of commodities, today reported its financial results for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Third Quarter 2024 and Year-to-Date Highlights Dividend: Declared a $0.40 per share dividend for Q3 2024 21 st consecutive quarterly dividend Cumulative dividends of $6.315 per share or approximately 40% of our share price 1 Q3 2024 dividend is payable on or about November 25, 2024 to all shareholders of record as of November 18, 2024 Genco enhanced its dividend policy to exclude the drydocking capex line item from the dividend calculation beginning in Q3 2024 This resulted in incremental dividends of $0.27 per share in Q3 2024 Growth: Acquired the Genco Intrepid, a high specification 2016-built 180,000 dwt Capesize vessel that delivered to the Company in October Financial performance: Net income of $21.5 million for Q3 2024, or basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.50 and $0.49, respectively Adjusted net income of $18.1 million or basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.42 and $0.41, respectively, excluding a gain on sale of vessels of $4.5 million, non-cash vessel impairment charges of $1.0 million and unrealized fuel losses of $0.1 million Adjusted EBITDA of $36.9 million for Q3 2024 2 Voyage revenues: Totaled $99.3 million in Q3 2024 Net revenue 2 was $69.8 million during Q3 2024 Average daily fleet-wide TCE 2 was $19,260 for Q3 2024 Estimated TCE to date for Q4 2024: $18,786 for 65% of our owned fleet available days, based on both period and current spot fixtures 2 John C. Wobensmith, Chief Executive Officer, commented, \u201cExecution of our value strategy was once again strong. We enhanced our dividend policy to increase cash distributions to shareholders, resulting in an 18% increase in our third quarter dividend over the prior quarter. Returning significant capital to shareholders remains a top priority for management and we have now declared 21 consecutive dividends, representing $6.315 per share, or ~40% of our current share price. Advancing our growth strategy also remains an important focus for management and subsequent to quarter\u2019s end, we took delivery of another high specification Capesize vessel. Including this acquisition, we have now invested ~$285 million in fleet expansion and modernization since the implementation of our value strategy. Consistent with our stated objective, we are pleased to have reinvested proceeds from the sales of older, less fuel-efficient vessels into this high-quality Capesize vessel to further increase our earnings power and modernize our fleet.\u201d Story Continues Mr. Wobensmith continued, \u201cDrawing on our leading commercial platform, we increased TCE 59% year-over-year. As we look to the end of the year, drybulk fundamentals remain positive, driven by ongoing capacity constraints, firm commodity demand and the beginning of fiscal and monetary easy cycles in key global economies. We are well positioned to continue to benefit from our significant operating leverage during a time when we continue to capitalize on our significant financial strength to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities, while delivering sizeable dividends to shareholders under our newly enhanced dividend policy.\u201d 1 Genco share price as of November 5, 2024 . 2 We believe the non-GAAP measure presented provides investors with a means of better evaluating and understanding the Company\u2019s operating performance. Please see Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Data below for further reconciliation. Regarding Q4 2024 TCE, actual results will vary from current estimates. Net revenue is defined as voyage revenues minus voyage expenses, charter hire expenses and realized gains or losses on fuel hedges. Comprehensive Value Strategy Genco\u2019s comprehensive value strategy is centered on three pillars: Dividends: paying sizeable quarterly cash dividends to shareholders Deleveraging: through voluntary debt repayments to maintain low financial leverage, and Growth: opportunistically growing and renewing the Company\u2019s asset base This strategy is a key differentiator for Genco , which we believe creates a compelling risk-reward balance to drive shareholder value over the long-term. The Company intends to pay a sizeable quarterly dividend across the cyclicality of the drybulk market while maintaining significant flexibility to grow the fleet through accretive vessel acquisitions. Key characteristics of our unique platform include: Industry low cash flow breakeven rate Net loan-to-value of 5% 3 Strong liquidity position of $380.0 million at September 30, 2024, which consists of: $47.0 million of cash on the balance sheet $333.0 million of revolver availability High operating leverage with our scalable fleet across the major and minor bulk sectors 3 Represents the principal amount of our credit facility debt outstanding less our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 divided by estimates of the market value of our fleet as of November 5, 2024 from VesselsValue.com. These figures are pro forma for vessel transactions that were consummated in Q4 2024. The actual market value of our vessels may vary. Financial Deleveraging 82% debt reduction since 2021 Debt outstanding: $80.0 million as of September 30, 2024 Paid down $25.0 million of debt in Q3 as we continue to actively manage our debt outstanding under our $500 million revolver to reduce interest expense and our cash flow breakeven rate In Q4 2024, Genco drew down $20.0 million to partially fund the acquisition of the Genco Intrepid We plan to continue to voluntarily pay down debt with a goal of zero net debt in order to enhance our ability to pay meaningful dividends and take advantage of strategic opportunities throughout drybulk market cycles Fleet Renewal Acquired the Genco Intrepid , a 2016-built 180,000 dwt Capesize vessel, for $47.5 million constructed at Dalian Shipbuilding in China. We took delivery of the vessel on the October 23, 2024. This is the third high-specification Capesize vessel that we have acquired over the past 12 months. Furthermore, we sold the Genco Warrior, a 2005-built 55,000 dwt Supramax vessel, for $11.95 million and the Genco Hadrian, a 2008-built 169,000 dwt Capesize vessel, for $25.0 million. Both of these vessels were scheduled to drydock in 2025, saving Genco approximately $5.0 million in drydocking expenses next year. The Genco Warrior was delivered to its buyer on July 5, 2024, and the Genco Hadrian was delivered to its buyer on October 4, 2024. Dividend Policy Genco declared a cash dividend of $0.40 per share for the third quarter of 2024. The Q3 2024 dividend is payable on or about November 25, 2024 to all shareholders of record as of November 18, 2024. Quarter ly dividend policy: 100% of quarterly operating cash flow less a voluntary reserve. During the third quarter of 2024, Genco enhanced its dividend policy to exclude the drydocking capex line item from the dividend calculation. Under the quarterly dividend policy adopted by our Board of Directors, the amount available for quarterly dividends is to be calculated based on the formula in the table below. The table includes the calculation of the actual Q3 2024 dividend and estimated amounts for the calculation of the dividend for Q4 2024: Dividend calculation Q3 2024 actual Q4 2024 estimates Net revenue $ 69.82 Fixtures + market Operating expenses (32.89 ) (32.95 ) Operating cash flow $ 36.93 Sum of the above Less: voluntary quarterly reserve (19.50 ) (19.50 ) Cash flow distributable as dividends $ 17.43 Sum of the above Number of shares to be paid dividends 43.5 43.5 Dividend per share $ 0.40 Numbers in millions except per share amounts Operating cash flow is defined as net revenue (consisting of voyage revenue less voyage expenses, charter hire expenses, and realized gains or losses on fuel hedges), less operating expenses (consisting of vessel operating expenses, general and administrative expenses other than non-cash restricted stock expenses, technical management expenses, and interest expense other than non-cash deferred financing costs), for purposes of the foregoing calculation. Estimated expenses for Q4 2024 are estimates and subject to change. The voluntary quarterly reserve for the fourth quarter of 2024 under the Company\u2019s dividend formula is expected to be $19.50 million, which remains fully within our discretion. A key component of Genco\u2019s value strategy is maintaining a voluntary quarterly reserve, as well as the optionality for the use of the reserve as Genco seeks to pay sizeable dividends across the cyclicality of the drybulk market. Subject to the development of freight rates for the remainder of the fourth quarter and our assessment of our liquidity and forward outlook, we maintain flexibility to reduce the quarterly reserve to pay dividends or increase the amount of dividends otherwise payable under our formula. The reserve is set by our Board of Directors at its discretion, and our Board has generally allotted an amount for anticipated debt prepayments plus an additional amount. We plan to set the voluntary reserve on a quarterly basis for the subsequent quarter. Anticipated uses for the voluntary reserve include , but are not limited to: Vessel acquisitions Debt repayments, and General corporate purposes The Board\u00a0expects to reassess the payment of dividends as appropriate from time to time. Our quarterly dividend policy and declaration and payment of dividends are subject to legally available funds, compliance with applicable law and contractual obligations (including our credit facility) and the Board of Directors\u2019 determination that each declaration and payment is at the time in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders after its review of our financial performance. Peter Allen, Chief Financial Officer, commented, \u201cDuring the third quarter of 2024, Genco continued to generate strong earnings achieving adjusted EBITDA of $36.9 million during the period. This brought year-to-date adjusted EBITDA to $118.5 million, already greater than the full year of 2023. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s decision to enhance the quarterly dividend calculation by removing the drydocking capex line item increased the amount of cash available for distribution augmenting our third quarter dividend. The ability to implement this adjustment was in large part due to Genco\u2019s industry low net loan-to-value ratio as we have reduced our debt by a total of 82% since implementing our value strategy in 2021. With $333 million in undrawn revolver capacity, Genco has significant financial flexibility and remains in a strong position to take advantage of accretive growth opportunities.\u201d Genco\u2019s Active Commercial Operating Platform and Fleet Deployment Strategy We utilize a portfolio approach towards revenue generation through a combination of: Short-term, spot market employment, and Opportunistically booking longer term coverage Our fleet deployment strategy currently remains weighted towards short-term fixtures, which provide us with optionality on our sizeable fleet. Our barbell approach towards fleet composition enables Genco to gain exposure to both the major and minor bulk commodities with a fleet whose cargoes carried align with global commodity trade flows. This approach continues to serve us well given the upside potential in major bulk rates together with the relative stability of minor bulk rates. Based on current fixtures to date, our estimated TCE to date for the fourth quarter of 2024 on a load-to-discharge basis is presented below. Actual rates for the fourth quarter will vary based upon future fixtures. These estimates are based on time charter contracts entered by the Company as well as current spot fixtures on the load-to-discharge method, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the voyage from the commencement of loading to the completion of discharge. The actual TCE rates to be earned will depend on the number of contracted days and the number of ballast days at the end of the period. According to the load-to-discharge accounting method, the Company does not recognize revenue for any ballast days or uncontracted days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2024. At the same time, expenses for uncontracted days will be recognized. Estimated net TCE - Q4 2024 to Date Vessel Type Fleet-wide % Fixed Capesize $ 25,962 59 % Ultra/Supra $ 14,851 68 % Total $ 18,786 65 % Our index-linked and period time charters are listed below: Vessel Type DWT Year Built Rate Duration Min Expiration Genco Reliance Capesize 181,146 2016 BCI + 28% + scrubber 10-12 months Jan-25 Genco Ranger Capesize 180,882 2016 BCI + 28% + scrubber 11-14 months Feb-25 Genco Liberty Capesize 180,032 2016 $ 35,000 11-14 months Feb-25 Genco Resolute Capesize 181,060 2015 BCI + 23% + scrubber 11-14 months Apr-25 Genco Defender Capesize 180,021 2016 BCI + 23% + scrubber 11-14 months Apr-25 Genco Endeavour Capesize 181,057 2015 $ 30,565 12-15 months Oct-25 Financial Review: 2024 Third Quarter The Company recorded net income for the third quarter of 2024 of $21.5 million, or $0.50 and $0.49 basic and diluted earnings per share, respectively. Adjusted net income amounted to $18.1 million, or $0.42 and $0.41 basic and diluted earnings per share, respectively, excluding a gain on sale of vessels of $4.5 million, non-cash vessel impairment charges of $1.0 million and unrealized fuel losses of $0.1 million. Comparatively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a net loss of $32.0 million, or $0.75 basic and diluted loss per share. Adjusted net loss is $3.9 million or $0.09 basic and diluted loss per share excluding a non-cash vessel impairment charge of $28.1 million. Revenue / TCE The Company\u2019s revenues increased to $99.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $83.4 million recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher rates earned by our major and minor bulk vessels. The average daily time charter equivalent, or TCE, rates obtained by the Company\u2019s fleet was $19,260 per day for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $12,082 per day for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Voyage expenses Voyage expenses decreased to $28.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $34.3 million during the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower voyage expenses for our major bulk vessels, including lower bunker consumption. Vessel operating expenses Vessel operating expenses increased to $24.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $24.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Daily vessel operating expenses, or DVOE, amounted to $6,423 per vessel per day for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $6,113 per vessel per day for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to the timing of the purchase of stores and higher repair and maintenance costs. We believe daily vessel operating expenses are best measured for comparative purposes over a 12-month period in order to take into account all of the expenses that each vessel in our fleet will incur over a full year of operation. Based on current estimates, our DVOE budget for Q4 2024 is $6,200 per vessel per day on a fleet-wide basis. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses increased to $6.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $6.6 million for the third quarter of 2023 due to higher nonvested stock amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expenses Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to $16.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $17.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Financial Review: Nine Months 2024 The Company recorded net income of $63.7 million or $1.48 and $1.46 basic and diluted earnings per share, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Adjusted net income amounted to $59.4 million, or $1.38 and $1.36 basic and diluted earnings per share, respectively, excluding a gain on sale of vessels of $16.7 million, non-cash vessel impairment charges of $6.6 million, other operating expense of $5.7 million and unrealized fuel losses of $0.1 million. This compares to net loss of $17.8 million or $0.42 basic and diluted loss per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted net income is $10.3 million or $0.24 basic and diluted earnings per share excluding a non-cash vessel impairment charge of $28.1 million. Revenue / TCE The Company\u2019s revenues increased to $323.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $268.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in voyage revenues was primarily due to higher rates earned by our major bulk vessels and our Ultrabulk vessels that are in our minor bulk fleet. TCE rates obtained by the Company increased to $19,458 per day for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $13,855 per day for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Voyage expenses Voyage expenses decreased to $95.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $100.5 million for the same period in 2023. Vessel operating expenses Vessel operating expenses increased to $77.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $71.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. DVOE was $6,514 for the first nine months of 2024 versus $5,971 in the first nine months of 2023. The increase was primarily due to the timing of the purchase of stores and spares, higher repair and maintenance costs, and higher crew costs. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to $20.8 million as compared to $21.3 million in the same period of 2023 primarily due to lower legal and professional fees. EBITDA EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to $122.8 million compared to $36.2 million during the prior year period. During the nine months of 2024 and 2023, EBITDA included non-cash impairment charges, other operating expenses, gains on sale of vessels as well as gains and losses on fuel hedges. Excluding these items, our adjusted EBITDA would have amounted to $118.5 million and $64.4 million, for the respective periods. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $96.9 million and $52.2 million, respectively. This increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher freight rates earned by our major bulk vessels and our Ultramax vessels, as well as changes in working capital.\u00a0 This increase was partially offset by an increase in drydocking costs incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $73.7 million and ($3.3) million, respectively. This fluctuation was primarily a result of $79.1 million of proceeds from the sale of the Genco Commodus, the Genco Claudius, the Genco Maximus and the Genco Warrior during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $170.4 million and $60.8 million, respectively.\u00a0 The increase is primarily due to a $93.8 million increase in debt repayments made during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\u00a0 There was also a $15.9 million increase in the payment of dividends during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Capital Expenditures Genco\u2019s fleet consists of 42 vessels with an average age of 11.9 years and an aggregate capacity of approximately 4,446,000 dwt as follows: 16 Capesizes 15 Ultramaxes 11 Supramaxes In addition to acquisitions that we may undertake, we will incur additional capital expenditures due to special surveys and drydockings. Furthermore, we plan to upgrade a portion of our fleet with energy saving devices and apply high performance paint systems to our vessels in order to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. We estimate our capital expenditures related to drydocking, including capitalized costs incurred during drydocking related to vessel assets and vessel equipment, ballast water treatment system costs, fuel efficiency upgrades and scheduled off-hire days for our fleet for the balance of 2024 and 2025 to be: Estimated costs ($ in millions) Q4 2024 Q1 2025 Q2 2025 Q3 2025 Q4 2025 Drydock Costs (1) $ 6.99 $ 19.50 $ 11.55 $ 6.65 $ 3.10 Estimated BWTS Costs (2) $ - $ 0.53 $ 0.53 $ - $ - Fuel Efficiency Upgrade Costs (3) $ 1.77 $ 2.57 $ 0.68 $ 2.41 $ 0.14 Total Costs $ 8.76 $ 22.59 $ 12.76 $ 9.06 $ 3.24 Estimated Offhire Days (4) 111 265 165 95 55 (1) Estimates are based on our budgeted cost of drydocking our vessels in China. Actual costs will vary based on various factors, including where the drydockings are actually performed. We expect to fund these costs with cash on hand. These costs do not include drydock expense items that are reflected in vessel operating expenses. (2) Estimated costs associated with the installation of ballast water treatment systems are expected to be funded with cash on hand.

EBITDA is included because it is used by management and certain investors as a measure of operating performance. EBITDA is used by analysts in the shipping industry as a common performance measure to compare results across peers. Our management uses EBITDA as a performance measure in consolidating internal financial statements and it is presented for review at our board meetings. We believe that EBITDA is useful to investors as the shipping industry is capital intensive which often results in significant depreciation and cost of financing. EBITDA presents investors with a measure in addition to net income to evaluate our performance prior to these costs. EBITDA is not an item recognized by U.S. GAAP (i.e. non-GAAP measure) and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other indicator of a company\u2019s operating performance required by U.S. GAAP. EBITDA is not a measure of liquidity or cash flows as shown in our consolidated statement of cash flows. The definition of EBITDA used here may not be comparable to that used by other companies. 2) Average number of vessels is the number of vessels that constituted our fleet for the relevant period, as measured by the sum of the number of days each vessel was part of our fleet during the period divided by the number of calendar days in that period. 3) We define ownership days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet has been owned by us. Ownership days are an indicator of the size of our fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that we record during a period. 4) We define chartered-in days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which we chartered-in third-party vessels. 5) We define available days as the number of our ownership days and chartered-in days less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off-hire due to familiarization upon acquisition, repairs or repairs under guarantee, vessel upgrades or special surveys. Companies in the shipping industry generally use available days to measure the number of days in a period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues. 6) We define available days for the owned fleet as available days less chartered-in days. 7) We define operating days as the number of our total available days in a period less the aggregate number of days that the vessels are off-hire due to unforeseen circumstances. The shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period during which vessels actually generate revenues. 8) We calculate fleet utilization as the number of our operating days during a period divided by the number of ownership days plus chartered-in days less drydocking days. 9) We define TCE rates as our voyage revenues less voyage expenses, charter hire expenses, and realized gain or losses on fuel hedges, divided by the number of the available days of our owned fleet during the period . TCE rate is not an item recognized by U.S. GAAP (i.e., it is a non-GAAP measure). However it is a common shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare daily earnings generated by vessels on time charters with daily earnings generated by vessels on voyage charters, because charterhire rates for vessels on voyage charters are generally not expressed in per-day amounts while charterhire rates for vessels on time charters generally are expressed in such amounts. Our estimated TCE for the fourth quarter of 2024 is based on fixtures booked to date. Actual results may vary based on the actual duration of voyages and other factors. Accordingly, we are unable to provide, without unreasonable efforts, a reconciliation of estimated TCE for the fourth quarter to the most comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. When we compare our TCE to the Baltic Supramax Index (BSI) in this release, we adjust the BSI for customary commissions.

Daily vessel operating expenses are calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by ownership days for the relevant period.

Positive Points Genco Shipping & Trading Ltd ( NYSE:GNK ) reported a strong Q3 2024 with a 59% year-over-year increase in fleet-wide TCE performance. The company declared a $0.40 per share dividend for the quarter, marking an 18% increase from the previous quarter. Genco has successfully executed its fleet renewal strategy by acquiring three high-quality, fuel-efficient Capesize vessels, enhancing earnings power and reducing dry dock CapEx by $13 million. The company maintains a low net loan-to-value ratio of 5% and has over $330 million in undrawn revolver availability, providing significant financial flexibility. Genco's adjusted EBITDA for the first nine months of 2024 was $118.5 million, surpassing the full-year figure for 2023, indicating strong financial performance. Negative Points Recent freight rate volatility has been observed, with rates pulling back due to factors such as China's stimulus impact and customs-related issues in West Africa. Despite a constructive outlook, the drybulk market remains subject to cyclical volatility, which could impact future earnings. The company faces potential challenges from geopolitical changes, such as the incoming U.S. administration, which could affect global trade dynamics. Bauxite export disruptions have impacted the Capesize market, although the situation is expected to stabilize. Asset prices for vessels remain relatively high, which could limit acquisition opportunities despite the company's financial flexibility. Q & A Highlights Q : How do you think the incoming Trump administration will affect the shipping markets, specifically the drybulk market? A : John Wobensmith, CEO, explained that while there might not be substantial impacts on ton miles, unintended consequences like tariffs could disrupt global trade. Historically, goods continue to move, sometimes inefficiently, which could increase ton miles. He noted that past tariffs led to shifts in trade routes, such as U.S. grain being replaced by Brazilian grain exports to China. The administration's actions might prompt China to increase fiscal stimulus spending, but the overall impact remains uncertain. Story Continues Q : What has caused recent pressure on the drybulk market, and do you see the recent improvement as a modest bounce or the start of something more meaningful? A : John Wobensmith, CEO, attributed recent market pressure to factors like reduced bauxite exports and force majeures, which pushed Capesize vessels back into the Atlantic Basin, lowering freight rates. He noted a slowdown in iron ore exports and typical over-tonnage situations. However, he expressed optimism for rates firming up towards the end of the year, with a normal seasonal downturn expected in Q1, followed by recovery in Q2. Q : With Capesize valuations coming in, what does your acquisition pipeline look like, especially with your financial flexibility? A : John Wobensmith, CEO, stated that Genco is focused on its fleet renewal program, noting that while asset prices have softened slightly, they remain firm, particularly for eco vessels. The company is still in fleet renewal mode and will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions, leveraging its financial flexibility and liquidity. Q : Would you consider expanding beyond the Ultramax and Capesize fleet, given the opportunities in those segments? A : John Wobensmith, CEO, indicated that Genco will primarily stick to its current fleet strategy, focusing on Capesize and Ultramax vessels. He mentioned that while transformative opportunities in other segments could be considered, the company prefers not to engage in one-off transactions outside its established commercial platforms. Q : With the new dividend policy, what is the right amount of leverage for the balance sheet, and has that changed? A : John Wobensmith, CEO, stated that the goal remains to achieve net debt zero, providing flexibility for the dividend policy. The company is open to leveraging up for the right transaction, potentially increasing leverage into the 20% range temporarily, but not to 50%. The revolving credit facility is in place to support growth and accretive opportunities. For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .

Highlights: Pangaea (NASDAQ:PANL) Vs The Rest Of The Marine Transportation Stocks Anthony Lee Fri, Dec 6, 2024, 11:12 AM 5 min read In This Article: PANL -3.62% STNG +0.69% KEX -1.84% Q3 Earnings Highlights: Pangaea (NASDAQ:PANL) Vs The Rest Of The Marine Transportation Stocks As the craze of earnings season draws to a close, here\u2019s a look back at some of the most exciting (and some less so) results from Q3. Today, we are looking at marine transportation stocks, starting with Pangaea (NASDAQ:PANL). The growth of e-commerce and global trade continues to drive demand for shipping services, presenting opportunities for marine transportation companies. While ocean freight is more fuel efficient and therefore cheaper than its air and ground counterparts, it results in slower delivery times, presenting a trade off. To improve transit speeds, the industry continues to invest in digitization to optimize fleets and routes. However, marine transportation companies are still at the whim of economic cycles. Consumer spending, for example, can greatly impact the demand for these companies\u2019 offerings while fuel costs can influence profit margins. Geopolitical tensions can also affect access to trade routes, and if certain countries are banned from using passageways like the Panama Canal, costs can spiral out of control. The 5 marine transportation stocks we track reported a slower Q3. As a group, revenues missed analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 0.7%. Amidst this news, share prices of the companies have had a rough stretch. On average, they are down 5.5% since the latest earnings results. Pangaea (NASDAQ:PANL) Established in 1996, Pangaea Logistics (NASDAQ:PANL) specializes in global logistics and transportation services, focusing on the shipment of dry bulk cargoes. Pangaea reported revenues of $153.1 million, up 12.9% year on year. This print exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations by 8.3%. Despite the top-line beat, it was still a mixed quarter for the company. \"Strategically, this has been a historic year for Pangaea, one in which we've continued to advance our value creation strategy through a combination of targeted fleet expansion, strong operational execution, and accretive inorganic growth,\" stated Mark Filanowski, Chief Executive Officer of Pangaea Logistics Solutions. Pangaea Total Revenue Pangaea pulled off the biggest analyst estimates beat of the whole group. Still, the market seems discontent with the results. The stock is down 2.3% since reporting and currently trades at $5.84. Read our full report on Pangaea here, it\u2019s free .

Market Update As a result of the Fed's rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has come down from frothy levels post-pandemic. The general rise in the price of goods and services is trending towards the Fed's 2% goal as of late, which is good news. The higher rates that fought inflation also didn't slow economic activity enough to catalyze a recession. So far, soft landing. This, combined with recent rate cuts (half a percent in September 2024 and a quarter percent in November 2024) have led to strong stock market performance in 2024. The icing on the cake for 2024 returns was Donald Trump's victory in the US Presidential Election in early November, sending major indices to all-time highs in the week following the election. Still, debates around the health of the economy and the impact of potential tariffs and corporate tax cuts remain. Said differently, there's still much uncertainty around 2025.
