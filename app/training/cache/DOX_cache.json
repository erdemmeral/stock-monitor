[{"text": "Amdocs Limited (DOX): Why Should You Invest In This Undervalued Tech Stock Now? Talha Qureshi Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 8:35 PM 6 min read In This Article: DOX -0.91% We recently compiled a list of the 12 Most Undervalued Tech Stocks to Invest in Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amdocs Limited (NASDAQ:DOX) stands against the other undervalued tech stocks. Will Tech And AI Be The Driving Force in 2025? Katrina Dudley, global equity portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton Investments joined CNBC on December 31, 2024, to discuss which sectors are expected to continue with their gains in 2025. She mentioned that it is important to understand what sectors performed well last year to predict the future performance of the market. Dudley highlighted that technology was one of the sectors that worked well last year followed by some utility sector companies. The utility sector companies that performed well were mostly those power-producing companies that experienced increased demand due to AI. She emphasized that one of the themes she believes is secular and will continue to perform is the AI and the technology sector. While talking about the high valuations of technology and communication services sector, Dudley acknowledged that these sectors are trading at lofty valuations above the S&P 500 index. However, she emphasized that valuations have never been a reason to sell something. It is important to unpack what high valuations are telling about the industry. She thinks that valuations at the moment reflect the number of things that the market is getting right. For instance, the earnings growth for these sectors has been positive, which is very different from the infinite bubble scenario. Moreover, the second contributing factor to higher valuations as explained by Dubley is the network effect, which is driving returns to the biggest players in the industry. Concerning these two points, she thinks there is a good rationale behind the tech stocks' high valuation. Dudley also highlighted that one of the ways the valuation multiple can come down is when these companies grow their earnings ahead of market consensus. This she believes is one of the risks that the market should be cognizant about. As earnings growth for any company is difficult to predict and when the market is expecting the company to deliver earnings growth there is always a risk of mis-execution. Therefore these high valuation companies need to deliver on earnings growth. Dudley mentioned that she is not worried about the valuations however it is something that she would be watching closely.

How far can it push before consumers push back? Francisco Velasquez Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 11:03 PM 4 min read In This Article: NFLX +0.22% A \u201cNetflix\u201d logo shines brightly at the presentation of the new season (3) of the Netflix series \u201cBridgerton.\u201d - Image: Rolf Vennenbernd/picture alliance (Getty Images) Netflix ( NFLX ) has mastered the art of striking while the iron is hot . But with its latest price hikes, it faces the challenge of pushing limits without losing viewers. Netflix\u2019s dominance in streaming reached new heights as its shares surged more than 15% in early trading Wednesday, briefly touching $1,000 before edging back. The rally came after the company reported adding a record 19 million subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2024, pushing its total subscriber base to 302 million. The stock\u2019s strong performance \u2014up 79% over the past year \u2014 got an additional boost from Netflix\u2019s plans to raise prices. But while investors cheered the move, a key question remains: How much more can Netflix charge before testing subscriber loyalty? On Jan. 21, the same day it announced its fourth-quarter earnings, Netflix revealed plans to hike prices across most of its plans in the U.S., Canada, Portugal, and Argentina. The ad-supported tier is now $7.99 per month, up from $6.99, while the standard ad-free plan rises to $17.99 (from $15.49), and the premium plan hits $24.99 (up from $22.99). Gregory K. Peters, Netflix\u2019s co-CEO, called the ad-supported tier \u201can incredible entertainment value,\u201d describing it as a \u201chighly accessible entry point.\u201d Still, market watchers say that with increasing competition in the streaming space, the company will need to offer compelling content to retain customers. As it stands, price sensitivity among streaming subscribers seems to be decreasing. A survey conducted by software company Amdocs ( DOX ) found that only 25% of consumers say price impacts their loyalty today, down from 38% in 2020. But that doesn\u2019t mean Netflix can raise prices without consequences. Todd Hay, vice president of revenue and analytics at Plex, argues, \u201cThe problem with Netflix\u2019s ad tier is that it\u2019s pretty expensive compared to free and paid alternatives.\u201d Consumers may begin questioning the value of Netflix as it raises prices, especially when services like Hulu\u2019s ( DIS ) ad-free plan ( $18.99 ) and Max\u2019s ( WBD ) ( $16.99 ) are in a similar price range. And while Netflix has taken incremental steps, there\u2019s a limit to how much price hikes can continue without driving users away. For price-sensitive consumers, the $7.99 ad-supported tier may be their only option. But Destiny Chatman, consumer expert at TopCashBack USA, warns that more price increases could push those customers away. \u201cNetflix risks losing those customers who moved from shared accounts to a low-cost plan,\u201d she said, referring to Netflix\u2019s crackdown on password sharing in May 2023. Story Continues Ads could be a turnoff for many, too. Amdocs found that 38% of consumers oppose more ads, though younger generations, such as Gen Z and millennials, are open to the idea. Still, Netflix\u2019s pricing could face competition from Hulu\u2019s $10 ad-supported plan and Amazon Prime Video ( AMZN ), which offers ads for $14.99 a month as part of its broader membership. \u201cIf Netflix wants to stay competitive in the ad-supported space, it may need to rethink its pricing strategy,\u201d Hay from Plex said. Inflation is a major factor behind Netflix\u2019s price increases, as the company looks to boost profits while still investing in high-quality content. \u201cPrice increases are necessary to continue producing the content that consumers expect,\u201d Stefan Lederer, CEO of system software company Bitmovin, told Quartz. Netflix has earned its reputation as the never-ending faucet for blockbusters, from the Korean horror \u201cSquid Game\u201d to the historical romance \u201cBridgerton.\u201d Its viewership spiked on Christmas Day, too, thanks to the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight, which became the \u201cmost-streamed sporting event ever.\u201d \u201cCustomers are looking for increasing control over their entertainment experience, and at the same time, ready for content innovation,\u201d Anthony Goonetilleke, Amdocs group president of technology, told Quartz. If Netflix can strike the right balance of pricing, content, and customer experience, it could continue winning the streaming wars. Looking ahead, the company is gearing up for the return of \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cWednesday.\u201d Earlier this year, it ventured into live TV programming with WWE\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Raw.\u201d \u201cMore dollars, of course, means better content and customer satisfaction,\u201d said Ryan Schreiber of Streamline Technologies LLC. \u201cThe implicit agreement by the subscriber is that, \u2018I will continue, but I expect to continue to have something to watch.\u2019\u201d For the latest news, Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .

Wikipedia Blake Montgomery Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 6:00 PM 8 min read Mark Zuckerberg during an interview at Meta headquarters in Menlo Park, California, on 18 July 2024. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images Meta, Wikipedia, and The Truth\u2122 Hello, and welcome back to TechScape. Last Tuesday , I predicted Meta would enter a new political era after the departure of Nick Clegg. Two hours after I published last week\u2019s newsletter, Mark Zuckerberg declared that the new conservative phase would begin. It was sooner and more brazen than I had expected \u2013 and faster-paced. Zuckerberg announced he would disband Meta\u2019s US fact-checking operation because he believes his fact-checkers have been too politically biased. He feels the truth is better served by the mob; notes by Facebook users themselves in the style of Twitter/X will replace professional fact-checkers. Zuckerberg also announced that Meta would move its content moderation teams, which are separate from its third-party fact-checking operations, from California to Texas in a move, he said, will \u201chelp remove the concern that biased employees are overly censoring content\u201d. The laundry list of what Zuckerberg has done to win Donald Trump\u2019s approval is long, but today I\u2019m going to focus on these two items in particular, as they are indicative of how the rich and powerful are bending the concept of the truth to their own ends. The plan to dox Wikipedia editors and Meta\u2019s moves are attempts to politicize the truth by controlling its custodians. In news that is ominously and thematically related to Meta\u2019s announcement, the ultra-conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington DC, which published the influential Project 2025 roadmap for the president-elect, has laid out plans to go after Wikipedia\u2019s volunteer editors both online and off, possibly with facial recognition. Once doxxed, Wikipedia editors can be persuaded to stop \u201cabusing their positions\u201d and inserting what Heritage believes to be antisemitic entries. Heritage\u2019s plan was first reported by Forward , in a great scoop. It\u2019s not clear what type of antisemitism the Heritage Foundation seeks to address, but prominent Jewish groups have complained in recent months about changes made to sensitive Wikipedia entries related to the war in Gaza and its consequences, per Forward. The implication of this assault is that the organization believes facts make Israel look bad. Benjamin Netanyahu \u2019s government has barred journalists from entering Gaza for similar reasons. Last week was a banner one for the use of The Truth\u2122 as a political cudgel. The plan to dox Wikipedia editors and Meta\u2019s moves are attempts to politicize the truth by controlling its custodians. Facts online can be whatever you want them to be, rather than a shared set of incontrovertible, observable things that are the case, so long as you can manipulate their arbiters. Story Continues One surprising convergence of these pieces of news is that Wikipedia\u2019s system of volunteer editors works. Through a thousand corrections and minuscule debates, we emerge with an agreed-upon version of the truth. Perhaps Zuckerberg imagines Facebook\u2019s new system of community notes will work the same way. The differences between Facebook, Instagram and Wikipedia are as vast as the Gulf of America , though: the goal of Wikipedia is to compile and spread accurate information. That is not the aim of Facebook, Instagram, or any other social network, and has never been one of its strong points. Meta ending fact-checking in favor of community notes: observable, verifiable truth is not as important online as agreed-upon truth. We can read between the lines of Zuckerberg\u2019s loud proclamation that moderators will move from a liberal state to a conservative one: agreed-upon truth has moved to the political right \u2013 to Texas, specifically. The laws and politics of the state that houses the moderators will in part determine the acceptable range of discussion on Facebook and Instagram. Facebook and Instagram are so large that their terms of service in effect set the Overton window for online conversation across the world. California allows people obtaining driver\u2019s licenses to choose a non-binary option for their gender, X. Texas, by contrast, bans gender-affirming care for transgender minors. California\u2019s governor has vowed to defend healthcare providers performing out-of-state abortions. Texas instituted a six-week abortion ban in 2021 \u2013 before Roe v Wade was overturned. If one state is biased, so is its replacement. Meta\u2019s moderators were already in Texas before the announcement, as my colleague Dara Kerr reports . The relocation proclamation is an obvious play for the approval of Trump and Musk, who are both furiously tweeting about how much of an idiot the governor of California is as I write this. They are wielding the devastating wildfires in Los Angeles against Gavin Newsom as a bludgeon. The fires did not incite them to action; they have hated Newsom for a long time. The wildfires merely present an expedient means to criticize him, whatever the reality of the blazes might be. As Trump and Musk blame diversity, equity, and inclusion programs for the fact that LA\u2019s firefighters have not been able to surmount the blazes, Meta said on Friday it would terminate those programs . The name of Donald Trump\u2019s social network, Truth Social, fits into this line of thinking. On X, he communicated to the public via tweets. That was his first administration. He has presided over this near-decade of the erosion of factual reality in US politics. He is an expert at working the referees of a discussion. It was in response to his election that Meta introduced its dead fact-checking program. Now, in his second term, he speaks to us in posts called Truths. He owns the political concept of The Truth\u2122. Zuckerberg certainly thinks he does, at least. Joe Biden recognized the threat. He called Zuckerberg\u2019s choice \u201creally shameful\u201d. Users react to TikTok\u2019s likely ban in the US TikTok made its case before the US supreme court on Friday \u2013 unsuccessfully, early indicators suggest. Justices spent nearly twice the time questioning TikTok\u2019s lawyer as they did the solicitor general who spoke on behalf of the US. They appear to have far more problems with TikTok\u2019s argument that a ban violates the free speech rights of Americans than the government\u2019s argument that TikTok presents an enormous, if theoretical, threat to US national security. The ban is scheduled to go into effect on Sunday, 19 January, at which point TikTok will disappear from the app store but will remain available on your phone if you have already downloaded it. Parent company ByteDance can sell the app, but it has repeatedly proclaimed that it will not do so; TikTok has said divestment is impossible. In response to the impending blackout, TikTokers are making videos bidding farewell to their \u201cpersonal Chinese spy\u201d. In their videos, they thank the spies in clunky, Google-translated Mandarin for five good years \u2013 TikTok debuted in the US in 2019 \u2013 of memes, dances, viral trends, and the collection of sensitive user data by a foreign adversary. Within the meme, people are expressing genuine sadness over the departure of an app that has brought joy into their lives as well as tangible financial benefits. What happens to the cottage industry of TikTok influencers now is anybody\u2019s guess. In one emblematic thank you, Lisandra Vazquez, who had 128,000 followers, tells the camera: \u201cTo my Chinese spy, thank you for your service. If we don\u2019t get to hang out anymore, I just want to thank you for the good times we\u2019ve had. I just know it was you looking out for me and sending me those tarot readers telling me he was no good for me \u2018cause there\u2019s no other reason they would show up. You put \u2018Sprinkle Sprinkle Lady\u2019 in my life, and you\u2019re still doing your big one with all the Bad Bunny content. \u201cYou\u2019ve connected me to a lot of people that I would have never met otherwise. You allowed me a place to have my voice be heard authentically, and you allowed me to leave a job that I hated so I could find a place here and make a job for myself on this platform. \u201cYou know me better than I know myself. I trust you with all my data. Xie xie, you beautiful bitch. I love you. Thank you for everything,\u201d she says. The sentiment is genuine even as the form it takes is one of a joke. Another video, made by a TikToker with about 800,000 followers, shows her walking with a suitcase into the sunset. The caption: \u201cMe because I\u2019d rather move to China than Instagram Reels\u201d. She\u2019s right: Meta stands to benefit most from the demise of its most successful competitor. \u201cPersonal spy\u201d is a riff on the \u201cmy FBI agent meme\u201d, making light of surveillance of US citizens by domestic tech companies and the federal government. Both the US and China are spying on their own citizens and foreign ones. Both Meta and Google collect sensitive data about their users like TikTok. The solicitor general said in Friday\u2019s supreme court hearing that TikTok could operate exactly the way it does today if it had an owner in the US. Surveillance is fine, the government attorney seemed to say, so long we\u2019re the ones doing it. The argument has carried water in court. The appeals court that denied TikTok an injunction against the ban in December sided with the government\u2019s claim that the threat of covert manipulation by an adversary \u2013 no public evidence it has occurred yet \u2013 is reason enough for Congress to forbid foreign ownership of a popular communications platform. It is a compelling national security interest to prevent enemy spying while enabling your own. Among the online hoi polloi, though, the obvious hypocrisy of \u201crules for me, not for thee\u201d doesn\u2019t play so well. Read the full story on Friday\u2019s hearing.

Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 8:19 PM 2 min read In This Article: DOX -0.91% If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. That's why when we briefly looked at Amdocs' ( NASDAQ:DOX ) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw. Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Amdocs: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.15 = US$760m \u00f7 (US$6.4b - US$1.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024) . So, Amdocs has an ROCE of 15%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the IT industry average of 11% it's much better. See our latest analysis for Amdocs NasdaqGS:DOX Return on Capital Employed January 15th 2025 In the above chart we have measured Amdocs' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Amdocs . What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us While the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. The company has consistently earned 15% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 20% in that time. 15% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Amdocs has consistently earned this amount. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders. The Key Takeaway To sum it up, Amdocs has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. And given the stock has only risen 24% over the last five years, we'd suspect the market is beginning to recognize these trends. So to determine if Amdocs is a multi-bagger going forward, we'd suggest digging deeper into the company's other fundamentals. While Amdocs doesn't shine too bright in this respect, it's still worth seeing if the company is trading at attractive prices.

Technology Stock Right Now Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 8, 2025, 7:50 PM 4 min read In This Article: DXC +1.34% DXC Technology Company DXC shares have gained 10.3% over the past six months and outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector\u2019s return of 4.9%, reflecting investor confidence. The company has made significant strides in its operational performance, innovation capabilities and financial stability, making it an attractive investment opportunity. Here are three compelling reasons to consider adding DXC stock to investors\u2019 portfolios right now. DXC\u2019s Transformation Efforts DXC\u2019s sustained efforts toward transforming itself from a struggling, highly leveraged company to a high-growth, business-oriented firm are commendable. DXC was formed by the merger of Computer Sciences Corporation (\u201cCSC\u201d) and the Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company HPE, which was completed on April 1, 2017. CSC, prior to the completion of the merger, took an additional debt. This amplified DXC\u2019s total long-term liability, thereby increasing its interest cost burden while limiting its scope for investing in growth opportunities. To overcome this situation, DXC resorted to debt refinancing and divestment, as well as a spin-off of non-core assets. The strategy significantly reduced its outstanding debt level to $3.83 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024, from $10.33 billion as of June 30, 2020. Divestment and spinning off non-core assets have improved DXC\u2019s focus on its core businesses. Also, it enhances the firm\u2019s ability to execute acquisition strategies across high-growth businesses, including enterprise software-as-a-service, technology security solutions and autonomous driving. The trimmed business is likely to help DXC focus on reviving its financial performance, which has been hurt by a slowdown in IT spending. Additionally, a low-leverage balance sheet will provide it with financial flexibility in investing in growth areas. DXC Technology Company. Price and Consensus DXC Technology Company.

Quote DXC\u2019s Leadership in AI and Digital Services Innovation DXC is leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance its product offerings and differentiate itself in a competitive IT services market. A prime example is its Generative AI Center of Excellence, which has been instrumental in deploying AI-powered solutions across industries. Moreover, with its most recent launch of AI Impact in January 2025, a strategy aimed at assisting clients in resolving their most urgent problems, DXC leverages its extensive industry knowledge and technological know-how to jointly develop solutions, services and experiences that will produce tangible business results utilizing the newest technological advancements. DXC is also focusing on assisting customers in managing the entire GenAI life cycle, from initial deployments to creating comprehensive solutions that safely expand with their companies. This entails matching the most recent language models to satisfy customer demands and guaranteeing that GenAI solutions have access to accurate, up-to-date, and clean data. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, DXC showcased its innovation with a generative AI virtual service agent developed for Equitable Holdings. This solution improved response times by an impressive 80%, underscoring the company\u2019s ability to deliver tangible business outcomes for its clients. As enterprises increasingly adopt AI to drive efficiency and innovation, DXC\u2019s early leadership in this space positions it for significant growth. Additionally, the company\u2019s focus on digital transformation is evident in its expanding Global Business Services (GBS) segment, which constitutes over half of its total revenues. The GBS segment delivered a profit margin of 12.8% in the second quarter, with the core insurance services and software businesses growing by 5% year over year. Story Continues DXC\u2019s Attractive Valuation DXC\u2019s valuation adds to its appeal. The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 6.27, significantly below the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry average of 38.11. This reasonable valuation, coupled with the company\u2019s growth potential, offers an appealing entry point for investors seeking exposure to the IT services industry. The stock\u2019s current P/E multiple is also lower than other peers in the IT Services industry, including Science Applications International SAIC and Amdocs DOX. At present, SAIC and DOX trade at a P/E multiple of 12.66 and 11.81, respectively. Zacks Rank DXC\u2019s focus on transformational efforts, innovation in AI and digital services, and attractive valuation make it a compelling buy. DXC currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), implying that existing investors should keep holding the stock while new buyers should accumulate the stock.

uptake in breast cancer treatment with localised magnetic fields PR Newswire Tue, Jan 7, 2025, 4:33 AM 4 min read A recent study explained the mechanisms by which pulsed electromagnetic field therapy enhances doxorubicin uptake, paving the way for precision-driven cancer therapies with fewer side effects SINGAPORE , Jan. 6, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Researchers at the National University of Singapore (NUS) have developed a non-invasive method to improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy while reducing its harmful side effects. National University of Singapore Logo (PRNewsFoto/National University of Singapore) By applying brief, localised pulses of magnetic fields, the team demonstrated a significant increase in the uptake of doxorubicin (DOX), a widely used chemotherapy drug, into breast cancer cells, with minimal impact on healthy tissues. This selective uptake enables more precise targeting of cancer cells, potentially improving treatment outcomes and reducing the adverse effects often associated with chemotherapy. The study, led by Associate Professor Alfredo Franco-Obreg\u00f3n, Principal Investigator at the Institute for Health Innovation & Technology (iHealthtech) at NUS and faculty member of the Department of Surgery at NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (NUS Medicine), is the first to systematically show how pulsed magnetic fields enhance DOX uptake in cancer cells. The team also showed that this approach could suppress tumours at lower drug doses. The team's research was published in the journal Cancers on 18 November 2024 . It builds on earlier work from 2022 , which first revealed that certain cancer cells are more vulnerable to magnetic field therapy. Targeted therapy for better chemotherapy outcomes and fewer side effects DOX is a commonly used chemotherapy drug for breast cancer. It works by binding to DNA components and disrupting cell replication and respiration, which then kills off cancer cells. Despite its efficacy, it is a non-selective drug, which means it can also damage healthy tissues, leading to side effects ranging from mild to severe, including cardiomyopathy and muscle atrophy. To address these challenges, the NUS researchers developed a novel approach that uses brief pulses of magnetic fields to selectively increase DOX uptake into breast cancer cells. Their study revealed the role of a calcium ion channel known as TRPC1, which is often found in aggressive cancers, including breast cancer. Magnetic field exposure activates TRPC1, enhancing its ability to facilitate the entry of DOX into cancer cells. The researchers conducted experiments comparing the effects of the magnetic field therapy on human breast cancer cells and healthy muscle cells. They found that breast cancer cells took in significantly more DOX when exposed to magnetic pulses, while normal tissues were not targeted as much. A 10-minute magnetic field exposure reduced the drug concentration needed for similar amount of cancer killing by half, particularly at low doses of the drug. Story Continues In contrast, healthy muscle cells did not show an increase in cell death in response to the combination of DOX and magnetic pulses indicating greater protection for non-cancerous tissues. The team also demonstrated that reducing TRPC1 expression or blocking its activity eliminated this effect, which confirms the crucial role of TRPC1 channels in the process. \"Importantly, when we increased the amount of TRPC1, we observed an increase in DOX uptake \u2014 this means that TRPC1 can be used as a viable therapeutic target for aggressive cancers,\" said Mr Viresh Krishnan Sukumar , the paper's first author and a PhD candidate at NUS Centre for Cancer Research (N2CR) under NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine. \"What's promising is that this mechanism works strongest at low drug concentrations, enabling us to target cancer cells more effectively while reducing the burden of chemotherapy on healthy tissues,\" Assoc Prof Franco-Obreg\u00f3n added. With breast cancer remaining the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide, the need for novel treatment strategies is urgent. \"The majority of women who undergo chemotherapy experience side effects from treatment, and in some cases, doses of chemotherapy need to be reduced, or in severe cases, stopped prematurely,\" said research team member Assistant Professor Joline Lim , Principal Investigator at N2CR and Senior Consultant, Department of Haematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute, Singapore . \"Moreover, prolonged exposure to high-dose chemotherapy can also lead to drug resistance. This targeted approach represents an excellent opportunity to potentially improve treatment outcomes while preserving patients' quality of life.\" Advancing the frontier of precision oncology The team's magnetic-assisted approach addresses one of the biggest challenges of chemotherapy, namely its toxic effects on healthy tissues. By selectively enhancing drug uptake into cancer cells, this method has the potential to drastically reduce the systemic side effects often experienced by breast cancer patients. This not only improves treatment outcomes and quality of life, but also encourages earlier treatment for those hesitant about treatment side effects. The study also underscores the role of biomarkers, such as elevated TRPC1 expression, in transforming cancer care by enabling precision-driven treatment options. Future work will focus on translating these findings into clinical practice by localising magnetic field exposure specifically to tumours in patients. This would further validate the potential to reduce systemic DOX doses while maximising localised drug delivery in cancer cells. \"Our approach will be patented and form the foundation for a startup specialising in breast cancer treatment. We are currently in discussions with potential investors in Southeast Asia and the United States to translate this technology from bench to bedside,\" shared Assoc Prof Franco-Obreg\u00f3n.

Going Ex-Dividend Soon editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Thu, Dec 26, 2024, 1:55 PM 4 min read In This Article: DOX -0.91% Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Amdocs Limited ( NASDAQ:DOX ) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Accordingly, Amdocs investors that purchase the stock on or after the 31st of December will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 31st of January. The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.479 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.92 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Amdocs has a trailing yield of approximately 2.2% on its current stock price of US$86.87. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. Check out our latest analysis for Amdocs Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Amdocs paid out a comfortable 44% of its profit last year. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Fortunately, it paid out only 34% of its free cash flow in the past year. It's positive to see that Amdocs's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut. Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends. NasdaqGS:DOX Historic Dividend December 26th 2024 Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing? Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. This is why it's a relief to see Amdocs earnings per share are up 4.6% per annum over the last five years. Recent earnings growth has been limited. Yet there are several ways to grow the dividend, and one of them is simply that the company may choose to pay out more of its earnings as dividends. Story Continues The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Amdocs has increased its dividend at approximately 12% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders. To Sum It Up Should investors buy Amdocs for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share growth has been growing somewhat, and Amdocs is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends. This is interesting for a few reasons, as it suggests management may be reinvesting heavily in the business, but it also provides room to increase the dividend in time. It might be nice to see earnings growing faster, but Amdocs is being conservative with its dividend payouts and could still perform reasonably over the long run. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research. Curious what other investors think of Amdocs?

Accounting Might Explain Soft Earnings editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Tue, Dec 24, 2024, 9:25 PM 2 min read In This Article: DOX -0.91% Shareholders appeared unconcerned with Amdocs Limited's ( NASDAQ:DOX ) lackluster earnings report last week. We think that the softer headline numbers might be getting counterbalanced by some positive underlying factors. View our latest analysis for Amdocs NasdaqGS:DOX Earnings and Revenue History December 24th 2024 The Impact Of Unusual Items On Profit For anyone who wants to understand Amdocs' profit beyond the statutory numbers, it's important to note that during the last twelve months statutory profit was reduced by US$131m due to unusual items. While deductions due to unusual items are disappointing in the first instance, there is a silver lining. We looked at thousands of listed companies and found that unusual items are very often one-off in nature. And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies. Assuming those unusual expenses don't come up again, we'd therefore expect Amdocs to produce a higher profit next year, all else being equal. That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates. Our Take On Amdocs' Profit Performance Because unusual items detracted from Amdocs' earnings over the last year, you could argue that we can expect an improved result in the current quarter. Based on this observation, we consider it likely that Amdocs' statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! On the other hand, its EPS actually shrunk in the last twelve months. Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors. Obviously, we love to consider the historical data to inform our opinion of a company. But it can be really valuable to consider what other analysts are forecasting. So feel free to check out our free graph representing analyst forecasts . This note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of Amdocs' profit. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company. Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business.

International Revenue in Focus: Trends and Expectations Zacks Equity Research Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 5:15 PM 4 min read In This Article: DOX -0.91% Have you evaluated the performance of Amdocs' (DOX) international operations for the quarter ending September 2024? Given the extensive global presence of this provider of computer systems integration, analyzing the patterns in international revenues is crucial for understanding its financial strength and potential for growth. In the current global economy, which is more interconnected than ever, a company's success in penetrating international markets is crucial for its financial health and growth journey. Investors must understand a company's dependence on overseas markets, as this offers a window into the company's earnings stability, its ability to benefit from varied economic cycles and its potential for long-term growth. Being present in foreign markets serves as protection against local economic declines and helps benefit from more rapidly expanding economies. Yet, such expansion also introduces challenges related to currency fluctuations, geopolitical uncertainties and varied market behaviors. While analyzing DOX's performance for the last quarter, we found some intriguing trends in revenues from its overseas segments that Wall Street analysts commonly model and monitor. The company's total revenue for the quarter amounted to $1.26 billion, marking an increase of 1.7% from the year-ago quarter. We will next turn our attention to dissecting DOX's international revenue to get a clearer picture of how significant its operations are outside its main base. A Dive into DOX's International Revenue Trends Europe accounted for 14.57% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $184.1 million. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of -0.52%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $185.06 million. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, Europe contributed $175.9 million (14.07%) and $175.5 million (14.12%) to the total revenue, respectively. Rest of the world generated $244 million in revenues for the company in the last quarter, constituting 19.31% of the total. This represented a surprise of +1.39% compared to the $240.67 million projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively, in the previous quarter, Rest of the world accounted for $245.3 million (19.62%), and in the year-ago quarter, it contributed $232.6 million (18.72%) to the total revenue. Anticipated Revenues in Overseas Markets Wall Street analysts expect Amdocs to report a total revenue of $1.11 billion in the current fiscal quarter, which suggests a decline of 10.5% from the prior-year quarter. Revenue shares from Europe and Rest of the world are predicted to be 16.9% and 22.1%, corresponding to amounts of $187.73 million and $245.92 million, respectively. Story Continues Analysts expect the company to report a total annual revenue of $4.51 billion for the full year, marking a decrease of 9.9% compared to last year. The expected revenue contributions from Europe and Rest of the world are projected to be 16.8% ($757.56 million) and 22.8% ($1.03 billion) of the total revenue, in that order. Key Takeaways Relying on global markets for revenues presents both prospects and challenges for Amdocs. Therefore, scrutinizing its international revenue trends is key to effectively forecasting the company's future outlook. With the increasing intricacies of global interdependence and geopolitical strife, Wall Street analysts meticulously observe these patterns, especially for companies with an international footprint, to tweak their forecasts of earnings. Importantly, several additional factors, such as a company's domestic market status, also impact these earnings forecasts.

Q4 Earnings Match Estimates Zacks Equity Research Wed, Nov 13, 2024, 1:25 AM 3 min read In This Article: DOX -0.91% Amdocs (DOX) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.70 per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This compares to earnings of $1.42 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. A quarter ago, it was expected that this provider of computer systems integration would post earnings of $1.61 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.62, delivering a surprise of 0.62%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once. Amdocs , which belongs to the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, posted revenues of $1.26 billion for the quarter ended September 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.16%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.24 billion. The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Amdocs shares have added about 5.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 25.8%. What's Next for Amdocs? While Amdocs has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Amdocs: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.71 on $1.27 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.06 on $5.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year. Story Continues Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computers - IT Services is currently in the top 16% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
