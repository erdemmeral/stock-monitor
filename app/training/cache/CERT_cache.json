[{"text": "Certara Inc. (CERT): Accelerating Drug Development with AI Amid Leerink\u2019s Target Price Boost to $13 Niloy Chakrabarti Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 8:48 PM 4 min read In This Article: CERT We recently compiled a list of the Top 10 Medical AI Stocks on Wall Street's Radar . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Certara Inc. (NASDAQ:CERT) stands against the other medical AI stocks. Investments in the global healthcare industry have ramped up sharply since the COVID-19 pandemic. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), the industry witnessed a rapid transformation in early disease detection, genomic research, drug discovery, clinical processes, and treatment efficacy prediction. According to a 2023 PwC report, the AI market in healthcare was valued at $11 billion and is expected to grow to $188 billion by 2030. On January 21st, Oracle Co-founder Larry Ellison said during a White House speech that AI plays an integral role in early cancer detection and vaccine development. He highlighted how AI could help detect tiny tumor fragments and assist in gene-sequencing malignancies for the development of mRNA vaccines at a rapid speed for customized cancer treatment options. Furthermore, AI is speeding up accurate decision-making by aligning big health data with pattern recognition systems, improving patient outcomes by ensuring timely clinical intervention. During a fireside chat at the annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference on January 13th, Mayo Clinic chief administrative officer Christina Zorn shared how the company addresses potential future healthcare worker shortages and improves cancer care by leveraging AI in robotics and pathology database management. \u201cWe\u2019re going to use, essentially, the robots to be a member of the healthcare team in the healthcare spaces,\u201d she said. \u201cWe saw a paradigm shift in healthcare. You\u2019re either going to disrupt from within, or you\u2019re going to be disrupted,\u201d she said. The significant growth potential in the evolving AI healthcare industry is driving investor interest in the sector as drug discovery and development companies continue to announce new-gen breakthroughs. For this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

On January 17th, Leerink Partners boosted the company\u2019s target price to $13 from $12 and reiterated its \u201cHold\u201d rating. Analyst Michael Cherny\u2019s rating is based on Certara Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:CERT) robust FY24 performance, driven by revenue growth in both software and services segments, attributable to the Chemaxon acquisition. However, the brokerage remains cautious of potential weakness in services and volatility in the end markets for this year. Overall CERT ranks 1st on our list of the medical AI stocks on Wall Street's radar. While we acknowledge the potential of CERT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Electric Royalties Provides Progress Updates on Five Other Key Royalties ACCESS Newswire \u00b7 Electric Royalties Ltd. Electric Royalties Ltd. Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 3:45 PM 7 min read In This Article: ELECF Following announcements of financing involving its flagship lithium and manganese royalties, Electric Royalties Ltd. (TSXV:ELEC)(OTCQB:ELECF) (\"Electric Royalties\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to provide the following update on several other key assets in its royalty portfolio. Brendan Yurik, CEO of Electric Royalties, commented: \"We are delighted with the successful closing of our C$2.5 million equity financing last week and wish to thank our existing and new shareholders for their support. A small portion of these funds will be used to complete our closing obligations on our new cash-flowing copper-gold royalty on the Punitaqui mine in Chile with the balance available for general corporate purposes and further execution of our strategic plan. \"During 2024, the Company more than tripled its asset count and enters 2025 with 41 royalties plus 29 optioned properties that could be converted into royalties, together providing increasingly broad exposure to nine clean energy metals. \"In recent weeks, we announced the achievement of important financing milestones at Battery Hill and Seymour Lake that involve mining luminary Eric Sprott as well as the Canadian government (see Electric Royalties' news releases dated January 3, 2025 and December 24, 2024, respectively), and we're pleased also to release our first general asset update of the year. \"Key developments include metallurgy advancing at the Mont Sorcier Project ahead of the feasibility study, promising exploration results at the producing Punitaqui copper-gold mine, near-term resource update and bulk sampling results expected at the Graphite Bull Project, drilling results and new exploration targets identified at the R\u00e5na Nickel Project, and equity raised to help advance the Kenbridge Nickel Project.\" Highlights since the Company's previous update include: Punitaqui Copper Mine (0.75% Gross Revenue Royalty) - On January 14, 2025, Battery Mineral Resources Corp. (TSXV: BMR) (\"BMR\") announced assay results from its 2024 underground exploration and in-fill drill program at the San Andres deposit area of the Punitaqui copper mine complex in Chile. According to BMR's Vice President of Exploration, Peter Doyle, \"This drilling confirmed the copper grades which exist in the current geological model and better delineated the extent of the mineralization\u2026[Drilling at holes SAM-24-06 and SAM-24-07] has confirmed a fault offset of the lower shale which represents a new target east of the fault for future drilling.\" Story Continues Drill holes SAM-24-06, 07, 08, 09,10, 11 and 12 have returned results as follows: \u2022 SAM-24-06: 2.9 meters (m) at 0.92% total copper (CuT) and 27.3g/t (grams per tonne) silver (Ag) and 1.8m at 2.76% CuT and 21.0g/t Ag \u2022 SAM-24-07: 15.6m grading 0.9% CuT and 15.0g/t Ag \u2022 SAM-24-08: 5.1m at 0.9% CuT and 3.4g/t Ag \u2022 SAM-24-09: 9.8m at 1.1% CuT and 13.2g/t Ag \u2022 SAM-24-10: 19.8m at 2.3% CuT and 26.4g/t Ag \u2022 SAM-24-11: 21.9m at 1.2% CuT and 15.4g/t Ag \u2022 SAM-24-12: 12.0m at 1.1% CuT and 20.7g/t Ag and 10.2m at 1.2% CuT and 12.7g/t Ag Note: All intercepts reported as estimated true widths intervals. According to BMR, these drill results have been added to the three-dimensional geology and resource models that its mining engineers will use to update stope designs and optimize mining plans. The underground drilling program is focused on exploring accessible targets within the existing Inferred Resource with the goal to upgrade the resource to a higher resource category, and also targeting areas adjacent to the Inferred Resource to potentially add new resources. Electric Royalties is relying on the information provided by BMR and is unable to verify the reported drill information 1 . Graphite Bull Graphite Project (0.75% Gross Revenue Royalty) - On December 12, 2024, Buxton Resources Limited (ASX: BUX) (\"Buxton\") reported assay results from the remaining drill holes from its 2024 drill program at the Graphite Bull Project in Western Australia (see Electric Royalties' news releases dated December 5, 2024 and October 10, 2024 for summaries of earlier drill results). Buxton reported additional shallow, good grade intersections and is now completing 3D geological interpretation. An updated resource estimate is expected to be completed by February 2025. Buxton has also submitted a bulk sample derived from holes within the existing resource for qualification testwork; results are expected in February 2025. Graphite Bull flake concentrate was previously tested with positive results. On November 4, 2024, Buxton announced the completion of a A$0.6 million financing to fund the updated mineral resource estimate for Graphite Bull, additional exploration activities, and product qualification work with downstream battery producers. Electric Royalties is relying on the information provided by Buxton and is unable to verify the reported drill information 2 . Mont Sorcier Iron and Vanadium Project (1.0% Gross Metal Vanadium Royalty) - On December 4, 2024, Cerrado Gold Inc. (TSXV: CERT) (\"Cerrado\") announced that work programs are underway toward completion of a feasibility study of the Mont Sorcier Project near Chibougamau, Qu\u00e9bec, by the end of Q1 2026. Detailed metallurgical testwork programs are currently being undertaken to build on previous metallurgical test results announced in March 2024. Cerrado has also selected various consultants to undertake key work programs in 2025 to deliver the feasibility study, including lead consultant and study integrator DRA Global which will also be responsible for the updated mineral resource estimate, mine design and planning, geotech and hydrogeology. Electric Royalties is relying on the information provided by Cerrado. R\u00e5na Nickel-Copper-Cobalt Project (1.0% Net Smelter Royalty) - On December 18, 2024, Global Energy Metals Corporation (TSXV: GEMC) (\"Global Energy Metals\") and its strategic partner, Kingsrose Mining Limited (ASX: KRM) (\"Kingsrose\"), announced the receipt of all analytical results from the 2024 drilling program at the R\u00e5na Project in Norway, where three holes totalling 706 meters were drilled at the R\u00e5nbogen prospect. Drilling tested a previously undrilled zone of outcropping massive sulphide located 600 meters northwest of the massive sulphide zone intercepted at R\u00e5nbogen in 2023. Drilling discovered new zones of near-surface nickel-copper mineralization, indicating to Kingsrose that the R\u00e5na Project is prospective for polymetallic base metal sulphide mineralization within a large-scale intrusive system. Due to current nickel market conditions, limited exploration work is currently planned for 2025 to reduce expenditure and allow for Kingsrose to consider how best to advance the R\u00e5na Project. Electric Royalties is relying on the information provided by Global Energy Metals. Kenbridge Nickel Project (0.5% Gross Revenue Royalty) - On January 2, 2025, Tartisan Nickel Corp. (CSE: TN) (\"Tartisan\") announced that it has closed a C$500,000 financing with a 12-month escrow period to fund the exploration and development of the Kenbridge Project in Ontario, Canada. Electric Royalties is relying on the information provided by Tartisan.
