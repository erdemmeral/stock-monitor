[{"text": "Loss-Making enCore Energy Corp. (CVE:EU) Set To Breakeven editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sat, Jan 25, 2025, 4:09 PM 3 min read In This Article: EU -3.93% With the business potentially at an important milestone, we thought we'd take a closer look at enCore Energy Corp.'s ( CVE:EU ) future prospects. enCore Energy Corp. engages in the acquisition, exploration, and development of uranium resource properties in the United States. The company\u2019s loss has recently broadened since it announced a US$22m loss in the full financial year, compared to the latest trailing-twelve-month loss of US$46m, moving it further away from breakeven. The most pressing concern for investors is enCore Energy's path to profitability \u2013 when will it breakeven? We've put together a brief outline of industry analyst expectations for the company, its year of breakeven and its implied growth rate. See our latest analysis for enCore Energy Consensus from 4 of the Canadian Oil and Gas analysts is that enCore Energy is on the verge of breakeven. They anticipate the company to incur a final loss in 2024, before generating positive profits of US$9.5m in 2025. Therefore, the company is expected to breakeven roughly 12 months from now or less. How fast will the company have to grow to reach the consensus forecasts that anticipate breakeven by 2025? Working backwards from analyst estimates, it turns out that they expect the company to grow 68% year-on-year, on average, which is rather optimistic! If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, the company may become profitable much later than analysts predict. TSXV:EU Earnings Per Share Growth January 25th 2025 Given this is a high-level overview, we won\u2019t go into details of enCore Energy's upcoming projects, however, take into account that typically energy companies, depending on the stage of operation and resource produced, have irregular periods of cash flow. So, a high growth rate is not out of the ordinary, particularly when a company is in a period of investment. One thing we\u2019d like to point out is that The company has managed its capital prudently, with debt making up 5.6% of equity. This means that it has predominantly funded its operations from equity capital, and its low debt obligation reduces the risk around investing in the loss-making company.

A preliminary economic assessment of the Project, excluding the Inferred Resource, and using the current cost environment, which demonstrates robust economics for the Project with an after-tax Net Present Value (\"NPV\") of $133.6 million using an 8% discount rate and a project Internal Rate of Return (\"IRR\") of 33%. Paul Goranson , enCore's Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"This S-K 1300 Technical Report Summary for our Dewey-Burdock Project continues to demonstrate the Project's robust economics for supporting enCore's uranium production pipeline. At a time when continued and unprecedented geopolitical events demonstrate the value of domestically produced uranium to support America's increasing demand for energy, we expect that the Dewey-Burdock Project has the potential to become a significant supplier of fuel for clean and reliable nuclear power.\" Prior to January 1, 2025 , as a Canadian domiciled company, the mineral resource for the Dewey-Burdock Project has been disclosed solely under National Instrument 43-101. As of January 1, 2025 , as a U.S. domestic issuer, enCore Energy Corp. is now also reporting all mineral resources in accordance with Item 1302 of Regulation S-K (\"S-K 1300\"). S-K 1300 was adopted by the SEC to modernize mineral property disclosure requirements for mining registrants and to align U.S. disclosure requirements for mineral properties more closely with current industry and global regulatory standards. The mineral resource estimates set forth in this TRS have not previously been reported under the S-K 1300 format. Story Continues This TRS was prepared under S-K 1300 and filed with the SEC through EDGAR on Form 8-K. In addition, a Canadian technical report, entitled \"Dewey-Burdock Project, South Dakota, USA , National Instrument 43-101 Preliminary Economic Assessment Technical Report\", dated January 6, 2025 (the \"Canadian Technical Report\") was filed with Canadian securities regulators on SEDAR. The TRS and Canadian Technical Report were prepared by SOLA Project Services, LLC of Casper, Wyoming , with Stuart Bryan Soliz , P.G., Principal of SOLA Project Services, LLC being the Qualified Person for the purposes of National Instrument 43-101. Dewey-Burdock Project The Dewey-Burdock Project is an advanced-stage uranium exploration project located in southwest South Dakota and forms part of the northwestern extension of the Edgemont Uranium Mining District, about 13 miles north-northwest of Edgemont and is wholly owned by enCore. The Project is amenable for extraction of uranium using In-Situ Recovery technology (\"ISR\") (see below). enCore controls over 16,000 acres in the area, of which over 10,500 acres are within the Project's permit boundary. Mineral title is controlled by federal mining claims and private lease agreements.

Effective date of mineral resource is October 8, 2024. 2. enCore reports mineral reserves and mineral resources separately. Reported mineral resources do not include mineral reserves. 3. The geological model used is based on geological interpretations on section and plan derived from surface drillhole information. 4. Mineral resources have been estimated using a minimum grade-thickness cut-off of 0.20 ft% U 3 O 8 . 5. Mineral resources are estimated based on the use of ISR for mineral extraction. 6. Inferred mineral resources are estimated with a level of sampling sufficient to determine geological continuity but less confidence in grade and geological interpretation such that inferred resources cannot be converted to mineral reserves. 7. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Results of the Preliminary Economic Assessment (\"PEA\") The scenario used for the economic assessment for the Dewey-Burdock Project assumes a specific timeline in order to determine the appropriate economic results. It assumes that permitting and licensing actions are ongoing and forecasted completion is Q3 2026. Within the PEA, engineering is anticipated to commence by early 2026, and construction of the Dewey-Burdock ISR Uranium Central Processing Plant (\"CPP\") along with wellfield construction is anticipated to commence early in 2027. The PEA does not include any portion of the inferred resource. Using these assumptions, the PEA provides the following economic estimates: Estimated total capital costs: $264.2 M over the life of the Project; The estimated operating cost is expected to be $23.81 /lb of U 3 O 8 including CPP and wellfield operations, administrative costs, reclamation and decommissioning; 80% recovery of in situ mineral resources is expected; Pre-tax NPV: $180.1M with IRR 39%, net cash flow $476.8M ; After-tax NPV: $133.6M with IRR 33%, net cash flow $363.4 M . Current and future activities to proceed on schedule: Finalizing state and federal permitting and licensing work; Core drilling and analysis to finalize design plans and recovery parameters. Expected Production Facility Design and Capacity Parameters: The CPP is to be constructed on the Dewey portion of the project area; it will have Ion Exchange (\"IX\")recovery trains and yellowcake processing facilities; A satellite facility is to be constructed on the Burdock portion of the project area where IX resin is to be transported to the CPP for processing into yellowcake; Total flow capacity of 4,000 gpm; Annual capacity to process 1 million pounds of uranium per year; Over 14 million pounds of expected uranium recovery based on current plans.

About In-Situ Recovery Technology In-Situ Recovery (ISR) offers a minimally intrusive, eco-friendly, and economically competitive approach to mineral extraction. It's been proven a successful technique for obtaining uranium that replaces conventional open pit or underground workings with wellfield technology. ISR does not involve open pits, waste dumps, or tailings, making it more environmentally considerate. This method also streamlines the permitting, development, and remediation processes. With ISR, uranium is extracted without disturbing the surface, and once the process is complete, the land is restored to its original state and purpose. About enCore Energy Corp. enCore Energy Corp., America's Clean Energy Company\u2122, is committed to providing clean, reliable, and affordable fuel for nuclear energy as the only United States uranium company with multiple Central Processing Plants in operation. The enCore team is led by industry experts with extensive knowledge and experience in all aspects of ISR uranium operations and the nuclear fuel cycle. enCore solely utilizes ISR for uranium extraction, a well-known and proven technology co-developed by the leaders at enCore Energy. Following upon enCore's demonstrated success in South Texas , future projects in the production pipeline include the Dewey-Burdock Project in South Dakota and the Gas Hills project in Wyoming . The Company holds other assets including non-core assets and proprietary databases. enCore is committed to working with local communities and indigenous governments to create positive impact from corporate developments. www.encoreuranium.com Neither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.

has delivered a 979% return to shareholders over 5 years editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sun, Dec 15, 2024, 4:10 PM 3 min read In This Article: EU -3.93% enCore Energy Corp. ( CVE:EU ) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 11% in the last week. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last half decade have been spectacular. To be precise, the stock price is 979% higher than it was five years ago, a wonderful performance by any measure. Arguably, the recent fall is to be expected after such a strong rise. The most important thing for savvy investors to consider is whether the underlying business can justify the share price gain. While the long term returns are impressive, we do have some sympathy for those who bought more recently, given the 15% drop, in the last year. We love happy stories like this one. The company should be really proud of that performance! Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 11%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price. Check out our latest analysis for enCore Energy Because enCore Energy made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually desire strong revenue growth. That's because fast revenue growth can be easily extrapolated to forecast profits, often of considerable size. In the last 5 years enCore Energy saw its revenue grow at 100% per year. Even measured against other revenue-focussed companies, that's a good result. Arguably, this is well and truly reflected in the strong share price gain of 61%(per year) over the same period. It's never too late to start following a top notch stock like enCore Energy, since some long term winners go on winning for decades. On the face of it, this looks lke a good opportunity, although we note sentiment seems very positive already. The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image). TSXV:EU Earnings and Revenue Growth December 15th 2024 This free interactive report on enCore Energy's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further. A Different Perspective enCore Energy shareholders are down 15% for the year, but the market itself is up 24%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 61% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand enCore Energy better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for enCore Energy that you should be aware of before investing here.

(CVE:EU) Just Released Its Third-Quarter Earnings: Here's What Analysts Think editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 1:24 PM 3 min read In This Article: EU -3.93% Last week, you might have seen that enCore Energy Corp. ( CVE:EU ) released its third-quarter result to the market. The early response was not positive, with shares down 2.9% to CA$5.06 in the past week. Revenues of US$9.6m beat expectations by a respectable 9.7%, although statutory losses per share increased. enCore Energy lost US$0.10, which was 417% more than what the analysts had included in their models. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on enCore Energy after the latest results. Check out our latest analysis for enCore Energy TSXV:EU Earnings and Revenue Growth November 18th 2024 Following the latest results, enCore Energy's three analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$103.2m in 2025. This would be a substantial 130% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Earnings are expected to improve, with enCore Energy forecast to report a statutory profit of US$0.13 per share. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$104.9m and earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.12 in 2025. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates. The consensus price target was unchanged at CA$8.00, implying that the improved earnings outlook is not expected to have a long term impact on value creation for shareholders. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. The most optimistic enCore Energy analyst has a price target of CA$10.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at CA$7.00. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure. One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 94% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 100% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 1.7% annually. So although enCore Energy is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's definitely expected to grow faster than the wider industry. Story Continues The Bottom Line The biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around enCore Energy's earnings potential next year. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at CA$8.00, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets. With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

Nov. 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - enCore Energy Corp. (NASDAQ:\u00a0EU) (TSXV:\u00a0EU) (the \" Company \" or \" enCore\" ), America's Clean Energy Company\u2122, today reports results from the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 . enCore continued to enjoy rising revenue due to increasing extraction of uranium and sales of U 3 O 8 (\"yellowcake\") in the nine months of 2024.\u00a0 The Company commissioned the Alta Mesa In-Situ Recovery (\"ISR\") Uranium Central Processing Plant and Wellfield (\"Alta Mesa\") late in the second quarter ( June 13, 2024 NR ) as its second uranium processing plant, making enCore the only company in the United States with two operational uranium processing plants.\u00a0 The Company met its delivery commitments under contract with the delivery of 530,000 pounds of yellowcake, using both purchased and processed uranium during the nine month period.\u00a0 enCore continued to move its pipeline of projects ahead with permitting activities in South Texas and a drilling program in Wyoming . Nine Month Period Performance Highlights (in USD unless otherwise noted): The Company recorded revenue of $45 million from the sale of yellowcake; During the nine-month period, the Company extracted and packaged 100,261 pounds of yellowcake combined between its two operational South Texas Central Processing Plants (\"CPP\"), the Rosita and Alta Mesa ISR projects. Also, the Company delivered 56,551 pounds of yellowcake to a North American Conversion Facility; The Company continues to meet contractual commitments with contract deliveries of 530,000 pounds of yellowcake at an average sales price of $84.85 per pound; In Q3 2024, The Company entered its eighth uranium supply contract with a U.S. nuclear utility to deliver a total of 300,000 pounds of yellowcake in 2028 and 2029 above current long-term prices presently in the low to mid $80 per pound range 1 ; The Company conducted resource development drilling work at its Upper Spring Creek Project in South Texas to confirm uranium mineralization for the Company's next wellfield and to explore for roll fronts that may extend from the planned wellfield. Following the approval of the Class III Underground Injection Control (\"UIC\") permit received in June 2024 , the Company began installing the monitor well rings and baseline wells for the first wellfield at the Upper Spring Project. The project is planned to include a satellite ion exchange (\"IX\") facility and wellfield that will feed the Rosita CPP. Story Continues ____________________________ 1 Nuclear Market Review, November 8, 2024, Tradetech, LLC The Company conducted resource development drilling work at Alta Mesa in areas near the Alta Mesa CPP and the Meste\u00f1a Grande resource area, as reported in the project technical report. 2 In Wyoming , the Company conducted resource development drilling on its Dewey-Terrace project area, as well as conducted pre-submittal permit data collection by core drilling on its Gas Hills Uranium Project located in Fremont and Natrona Counties. Summary of Select Financial Highlights for the Quarter and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: (in thousands of US dollars) (CNW Group/enCore Energy Corp.) Revenue Discussion The Company's sales of 530,000 pounds of yellowcake were sourced from both purchased pounds and processed pounds at its Rosita In-Situ Recovery (\"ISR\") Uranium Central Processing Plant (\"Rosita\").\u00a0 These purchased pounds increased the cost of goods sold.\u00a0 As Alta Mesa came online late in Q2 there were no sales of processed pounds from Alta Mesa during the period.\u00a0 Revenues are expected to continue to increase throughout 2024, driven primarily by accelerated processing of uranium at Alta Mesa. As volume of yellowcake increases at Alta Mesa, this growth is expected to improve the Company's gross margin. Expense Discussion The increase in expenses is primarily due to activities related to the start-up of Alta Mesa, along with exploration and development efforts across several states. As both Alta Mesa and Rosita are in the early stages of start-up, they have incurred expenses and increased capital investments, both which are essential for fully realizing our growth strategy and achieving enCore's operational capacity. ____________________________ 2 \"Technical Report Summary for the Alta Mesa Uranium Project, Brooks and Jim Hogg Counties, Texas, USA; National Instrument 43-101, Technical Report,\" prepared by Douglas Beahm, PE, PG, BRS Inc. Riverton, Wyoming, January 20, 2023. Operations Performance Through the nine-month period, the Company observed increasing volume from both operating CPP's, primarily from Alta Mesa as the ramp up continues. The Company packaged 100,261 pounds of yellowcake during that period from the combined operations. Development drilling and wellfield installation continued at Wellfield 7 at Alta Mesa to support expansion through a second IX circuit at the CPP. During the quarter, wellfield solution head grades at Alta Mesa peaked at approximately 140 mg/L U 3 O 8 and averaged approximately 65 mg/L U 3 O 8 . The Company began resource development drilling to identify and classify additional mineral resources for additional wellfields beyond Wellfield 7. In South Texas , development drilling progressed on an expansion area adjacent to the planned wellfield at our Upper Spring Creek ISR Project that we expect will extend the volume of yellowcake for processing at the Rosita CPP. Following the approval of the Class III UIC permit for the Upper Spring Creek wellfield, monitor well installation commenced to advance the project to provide satellite IX feed for the Rosita CPP in 2025. Additionally, key materials, equipment and vessels have been ordered and staged in anticipation of commencing satellite IX facility and wellfield construction upon approval by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (\"TCEQ\") in early 2025. Outlook and Subsequent Events The Company's outlook is positive, with substantial and growing revenue from Alta Mesa contributing to financial results throughout the first nine months of 2024 and beyond, as additional production and extraction wells come online. The cost-to-revenue ratio is projected to decline, reflecting improved efficiency and profitability as the Company accelerates activities at Alta Mesa and, to a lesser extent, at Rosita for the remainder of the year.\u00a0 This trend is projected to accelerate as the Company expects to process in excess of one million pounds a year in 2025. Additional plant feed for Rosita will be developed at the Upper Spring Creek Project where the Company has submitted various permit and amendment applications to the regulatory authorities in anticipation of a late first half start-up in 2025. The nuclear industry outlook remains extremely positive with demand projections outpacing supply for the foreseeable future driven in part by increased electrical demand from Artificial Intelligence (\"AI\") and the commitment of many sectors of the economy to achieve zero carbon. Continued primary uranium production supply disruptions and constraints continue on a global basis as geopolitical tensions, trade restrictions, and local government decisions are observed. Current contracting conditions continue to remain favorable, with term contract pricing now higher than at the current spot price of $77.00 per pound.\u00a0 Current contracting prices are higher \u00a0than when the spot price reached its twelve-month high of $115 per pound U 3 O 8 3 . _____________________________ 3 Nuclear Market Review, February 2 and November 1, 2024, Tradetech, LLC Qualified Person John M.
