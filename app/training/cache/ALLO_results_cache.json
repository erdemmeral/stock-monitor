"MiNK Therapeutics Targets Immune Reconstitution to Combat Advanced Gastroesophageal Cancers with Novel Combination of Allo-iNKTs plus BOT/BAL at ASCO GI MiNK Therapeutics Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 10:13 PM 3 min read In This Article: INKT -14.19% MiNK Therapeutics NEW YORK, Jan. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MiNK Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: INKT), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the development of allogeneic, off-the-shelf invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cell therapies to treat cancer and other immune-mediated diseases, today announced a presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancers (ASCO GI) Symposium in San Francisco, California. \u201cINKT cells play a pivotal role in reconstituting lymphocytes, establishing a robust and responsive immune environment to address the complexities of advanced cancers. Agenus\u2019 botensilimab/balstilimab combination (BOT/BAL) amplifies this effect by enhancing T-cell priming, eliminating immunosuppressive regulatory cells, and fostering long-term immune memory. This novel multi-immune combination treats the immune system itself, fundamentally reshaping the tumor environment to make disease biologically unsustainable,\u201d said Dr. Jennifer Buell, Chief Executive Officer at MiNK Therapeutics. \u201cWe look forward to sharing further results from this study later this year.\u201d Phase 2 AgenT-797 plus BOT/BAL in Combination with Ramucirumab and Paclitaxel in Patients with Previously Treated, Unresectable or Metastatic Gastroesophageal Cancers (Abstract TPS515) This investigator-initiated, single-arm Phase 2 trial, conducted at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (NCT06251793), evaluates the novel combination of agenT-797 (iNKT cells), botensilimab, balstilimab, ramucirumab, and paclitaxel in advanced GE adenocarcinoma patients who have received at least one prior line of therapy. Data from the prior Phase I trial (NCT05108623) demonstrated long-term, durable responses and tolerability in PD-1 refractory relapsed/refractory cancers, including testicular, appendiceal, lung, and gastric cancers. Notably, gastric cancer patients exhibited significant clinical and immunologic responses, including robust T cell infiltration and expansion compared to non-responders. This novel, multi-immunologic combination demonstrated signals of tolerability and activity in patients with relapsed/refractory gastric cancer. MiNK plans to provide a clinical update from the ongoing Phase II study in the second half of 2025. The presentation will be available on the publications page of the MiNK website at the start of the scheduled presentation session at https://minktherapeutics.com/publications/ .

Wire Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 8:00 PM 4 min read In This Article: MAAT.PA +0.54% The Independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) has recommended that the trial proceeds as planned without modification. Consistent good safety profile and tolerability for MaaT033, a pooled donor-derived drug candidate in oral formulation. LYON, France, January 21, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Regulatory News: MaaT Pharma (EURONEXT: MAAT \u2013 the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biotechnology company and a leader in the development of Microbiome Ecosystem Therapies TM (MET) dedicated to enhancing survival for patients with cancer through immune modulation, announced that the DSMB completed its second safety assessment of the Phase 2b trial PHOEBUS, the largest randomized controlled trial assessing microbiome therapy in oncology to date, and recommended continuation of the trial without modification. The routine DSMB, which convenes every six months, is composed of 5 independent experts, reviewed safety data on 59 patients (cutoff date as of October 31 st , 2024) and concluded that MaaT033 is well tolerated and has an acceptable safety profile. \"We are pleased to see that the safety profile of MaaT033 remains positive, and the trial is advancing as planned. Additionally, we are proud to report that recruitment for our Phase 2b trial is progressing well, with 80 patients enrolled as of end of December 2024\", said Gianfranco Pittari, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer of MaaT Pharma. Patient enrollment continues to progress at a steady pace in France, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Netherlands and the United Kingdom, with 54 clinical centers open to date. The Phoebus trial is an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blinded study, testing MaaT033, an oral freeze-dried multi-donor formulation, as a potential adjunctive treatment for patients receiving Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (Allo-HSCT), against placebo. The trial is expected to enroll 387 patients and is set to be conducted in up to 56 clinical investigation sites ( NCT05762211 ). Upcoming milestones include the routine DSMB review for ongoing safety, conducted every six months, as well as a DSMB assessing mortality imbalance between arms, respectively at 60 patients (expected in Q1 2025) and at 120 patients (expected in Q3 2025), after 90 days of follow-up post Allo-HSCT. Previous data from a Phase 1b trial in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS) having received intensive chemotherapy (reported in January 2022) and from a Phase 1 trial in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) (reported in February 2024) further support MaaT033's favorable safety and tolerability profile.

Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 3:00 PM 7 min read In This Article: IPSC -4.95% Century Therapeutics, Inc. - Investigator-initiated trial (IIT) to be led by pioneers of cell therapy in B-cell mediated autoimmune disease, the Schett/Mackensen group at Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg - - Trial to evaluate and enhance clinical experience with CNTY-101 in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, lupus nephritis, idiopathic inflammatory myopathy, and diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis - PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Century Therapeutics , Inc. (NASDAQ: IPSC), an innovative biotechnology company developing induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cell therapies in immuno-oncology and autoimmune disease, has entered into an agreement for an investigator-initiated Phase 1/2 trial by Professors Georg Schett and Andreas Mackensen of its CD19 CAR-iNK investigational cell therapy candidate CNTY-101 in patients with B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases. The IIT, which is sponsored by the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, represents the first evaluation by the internationally recognized Schett/Mackensen group of an allogeneic iPSC-derived CD19-directed NK cell therapy for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Consistent with Century\u2019s ongoing Phase 1 CALiPSO-1 trial ( NCT06255028 ), the IIT (known as the CARAMEL trial) will evaluate safety, efficacy, and key translational data of CNTY-101 in systemic lupus erythematosus, lupus nephritis, idiopathic inflammatory myopathy, and diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis. \u201cThe decision by these internationally recognized experts to conduct their first evaluation of allogeneic iPSC-derived cell therapies in autoimmune indications with Century represents important recognition of the unique potential for CNTY-101 in this setting. We believe CNTY-101 is well positioned to address autoimmune diseases as an iPSC-derived NK cell therapy incorporating our Allo-Evasion TM technology for precise control over drug exposure, as supported by pre-clinical and clinical data demonstrating clear anti-B cell activity and an encouraging safety profile. We look forward to insights from Dr. Schett and Mackensen\u2019s research into Century\u2019s allogeneic iNK cell therapy to complement and enhance clinical experience in our ongoing Phase 1 CALiPSO-1 trial of CNTY-101, setting us up for important milestones in the year ahead,\u201d said Brent Pfeiffenberger, Pharm.D., Chief Executive Officer of Century Therapeutics. Dr. Andreas Mackensen, Director of Medical Clinic 5 \u2013 Hematology & Internal Oncology at Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, commented:\u00a0\u201cWe believe allogeneic iPSC-derived cell therapy with a consistent, off-the-shelf product like CNTY-101 holds immense promise in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, driven by the elimination of logistical hurdles such as apheresis, removal of washout concerns, and the potential for administration in outpatient settings. We look forward to our partnership with Century on this study as we seek to address significant unmet needs for patients across these serious diseases.\u201d Story Continues The Schett/Mackensen group at Erlangen has pioneered the development of cell therapy in autoimmune diseases, having first presented data in 2022 1 showing that autologous CD19 CAR-T cell therapy achieved deep depletion of B-cells in patients with severe autoimmune disease leading to groundbreaking clinical outcomes. Their data continues to provide evidence of long-term, drug-free remission, and has paved the way for broader clinical investigation of cell therapies in these indications. The CARAMEL trial with Century is intended to commence in mid-2025 following CTA approval. In addition to the Schett/Mackensen CARAMEL trial, the company plans also to expand the CALiPSO-1 clinical trial to include sites in select European countries. Century will provide timing on initial clinical data from its ongoing CALiPSO-1 clinical trial once a clear cadence of patient enrollment has been established across indications. About Century Therapeutics Century Therapeutics (NASDAQ: IPSC) is harnessing the power of adult stem cells to develop curative cell therapy products for cancer and autoimmune diseases that we believe will allow us to overcome the limitations of first-generation cell therapies. Our genetically engineered, iPSC-derived cell product candidates are designed to specifically target hematologic and solid tumor cancers, with a broadening application to autoimmune diseases. We are leveraging our expertise in cellular reprogramming, genetic engineering, and manufacturing to develop therapies with the potential to overcome many of the challenges inherent to cell therapy and provide a significant advantage over existing cell therapy technologies. We believe our commitment to developing off-the-shelf cell therapies will expand patient access and provide an unparalleled opportunity to advance the course of cancer and autoimmune disease care.
