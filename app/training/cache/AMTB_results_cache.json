[{"text": "Amerant Bancorp (NYSE:AMTB) Will Pay A Dividend Of $0.09 editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sun, Jan 26, 2025, 3:51 PM 3 min read In This Article: AMTB -2.50% Amerant Bancorp Inc.'s ( NYSE:AMTB ) investors are due to receive a payment of $0.09 per share on 28th of February. This payment means the dividend yield will be 1.5%, which is below the average for the industry. View our latest analysis for Amerant Bancorp Amerant Bancorp's Dividend Forecasted To Be Well Covered By Earnings Even a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. Amerant Bancorp is just starting to establish itself as being able to pay dividends to shareholders, given its short 3-year history of distributing earnings. But while Amerant Bancorp was able to sustain its dividend for a decent period of time, its most recent earnings report shows that the company didn't have enough earnings to cover their dividends. This is an alarming sign that could mean that Amerant Bancorp's dividend may no longer be sustainable for longer. Analysts expect a massive rise in earnings per share in the next 3 years. In addtion, they also estimate the future payout ratio could reach 14% in the same time period, which we would be comfortable to see continuing. NYSE:AMTB Historic Dividend January 26th 2025 Amerant Bancorp Is Still Building Its Track Record The dividend has been pretty stable looking back, but the company hasn't been paying one for very long. This makes it tough to judge how it would fare through a full economic cycle. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.24 in 2022 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.36. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 14% over that duration. We're not overly excited about the relatively short history of dividend payments, however the dividend is growing at a nice rate and we might take a closer look. The Dividend's Growth Prospects Are Limited Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. It's not great to see that Amerant Bancorp's earnings per share has fallen at approximately 4.9% per year over the past five years. A modest decline in earnings isn't great, and it makes it quite unlikely that the dividend will grow in the future unless that trend can be reversed. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited. An additional note is that the company has been raising capital by issuing stock equal to 25% of shares outstanding in the last 12 months. Regularly doing this can be detrimental - it's hard to grow dividends per share when new shares are regularly being created. Story Continues The Dividend Could Prove To Be Unreliable Overall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. The payments are bit high to be considered sustainable, and the track record isn't the best. We don't think Amerant Bancorp is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus. Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

Release Date: January 23, 2025 For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript . Positive Points Amerant Bancorp Inc ( NYSE:AMTB ) reported strong organic loan and deposit growth in the fourth quarter of 2024. Net interest income increased to $87.6 million, up from $81 million in the third quarter, with a net interest margin improvement to 3.75%. The company successfully completed the sale of its Houston franchise, resulting in a deposit premium of $12.5 million. Amerant Bancorp Inc ( NYSE:AMTB ) improved its capital ratios, with a total capital ratio of 13.43% and a CET1 ratio of 11.21% as of the fourth quarter. The company reported a significant improvement in its efficiency ratio, reducing it to 74.91% from 228.74% in the third quarter. Negative Points Total assets decreased to $9.9 billion from $10.35 billion in the third quarter, primarily due to the Houston franchise sale. Total deposits decreased by $256.9 million to $7.85 billion, also as a result of the Houston franchise sale. Non-performing loans increased by $69.7 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, despite a decrease from the third quarter. The company recorded a loss of $12.6 million on the sale of business-purpose investment property residential mortgage loans. Non-interest expense increased by $7.2 million from the third quarter, driven by transaction costs related to the Houston franchise sale and other non-routine items. Story Continues Q & A Highlights Q : Can you clarify the expected $14.2 million reduction in non-performing loans (NPL) and discuss the outlook for classified assets? A : Yes, the $14.2 million reduction is expected from the NPL bucket. We are focused on resolving classified assets and aim to reduce this balance quarter over quarter. We are laser-focused on reducing the non-performing list to just a handful, with weekly progress reports on each deal. Q : What is the outlook for net charge-offs and allowance for credit losses (ACL) levels throughout the year? A : We maintain our guidance of charge-offs around 25 to 30 basis points. The indirect consumer portfolio, now down to $83 million, will start reducing that level. The results this quarter at 26 basis points are a good reference for upcoming quarters. Q : How should we think about expenses and efficiency ratio for the year, given continued franchise investment? A : The first half of the year typically carries higher costs, including payroll taxes. We expect expenses to normalize slightly lower in the second half. The path to improved efficiency and ROA is primarily driven by growth and revenue. Q : What are your expectations for the investment portfolio size going forward? A : The investment portfolio size should remain relatively stable at its current level. Q : Can you discuss the expected margin pressure in the first quarter and the drivers behind it? A : The margin improvement in Q4 was due to the Houston franchise sale, securities repositioning, and reduction of FHLB advances. In Q1 2025, assets that repriced at the end of Q4 will have a full quarter impact, leading to a slightly lower margin.

This supplemental information is not required by, or is not presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company refers to these financial measures and ratios as \"non-GAAP financial measures\" and they should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the GAAP measures presented herein. We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including those mentioned above, both to explain our results to shareholders and the investment community and in the internal evaluation and management of our businesses. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures and the information they provide are useful to investors since these measures permit investors to view our performance using the same tools that our management uses to evaluate our past performance and prospects for future performance, especially in light of the additional costs we have incurred in connection with the Company\u2019s restructuring activities that began in 2018 and continued in 2024, including the effect of non-core banking activities such as the sale of loans and securities (including the investment portfolio repositioning initiated in the third quarter of 2024) and other repossessed assets, the sale of our Houston franchise, the valuation of securities, derivatives, loans held for sale and other real estate owned, impairment of investments, the early repayment of FHLB advances, Bank owned life insurance restructure, and other non-routine actions intended to improve customer service and operating performance. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our performance, this information should be considered as supplemental and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures presented by other companies. Exhibit 2 reconciles these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP reported results.

(14) In the year ended December 31, 2024, income tax effect amounts on nonroutine items of noninterest income and expense were calculated using estimated tax rates of 27.14% and 22.50%, respectively. In the year ended December 31, 2023, amounts were calculated using an estimated tax rate of 21.00%. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, amounts were calculated based upon the effective tax rate for the period of 21.50%. For all of the other periods shown, amounts represent the difference between the current and prior period year-to-date tax effect. (15) In the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, per share amounts and percentages were calculated using the after-tax impact of non- routine items in noninterest expense of $34.2 million and $52.3 million, respectively, and BOLI tax impact of $2.8 million in each period. In all other periods shown, per share amounts and percentages were calculated using the after tax impact of non-routine items in noninterest expense.

with quarterly earnings of $1.90 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.80 per share.

Pinnacle Financial , which belongs to the Zacks Banks - Southeast industry, posted revenues of $475.34 million for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.56%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $396.34 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Pinnacle Financial shares have added about 4.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2%. What's Next for Pinnacle Financial? While Pinnacle Financial has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock.

(AMTB) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 6:00 PM 5 min read In This Article: TBBK +0.10% PNFPP -0.44% Amerant Bancorp Inc. (AMTB) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price. The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 22, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.27 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -41.3%. Revenues are expected to be $100.54 million, down 0.7% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.7% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change. Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction). The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Story Continues Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Amerant Bancorp? For Amerant Bancorp, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%. On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3. So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Amerant Bancorp will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue? While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Amerant Bancorp would post earnings of $0.23 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.27, delivering a surprise of +17.39%. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once. Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Amerant Bancorp doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release. An Industry Player's Expected Results Another stock from the Zacks Banks - Southeast industry, Pinnacle Financial (PNFP), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.80 per share for the quarter ended December 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +7.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $463.47 million, up 16.9% from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Pinnacle Financial has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 2.08%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate. This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggests that Pinnacle Financial will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.
