Automotive Initiatives Brand Engagement Network, Inc. Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 3:35 PM 5 min read In This Article: BNAI -0.98% BNAIW +0.38% Brand Engagement Network, Inc. JACKSON, Wyo., Jan. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brand Engagement Network Inc. (\u201cBEN\u201d) (NASDAQ: BNAI), an innovator in AI-powered customer engagement solutions, today announced the termination of its Exclusive Reseller Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) with AFG Companies, Inc. (\u201cAFG\u201d) and the filing of a lawsuit in the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, against AFG and its CEO, Ralph Wright Brewer III. The lawsuit alleges fraudulent misrepresentation, breach of contract, and the concealment of a ransomware attack on their network shortly before the agreement was executed. The Agreement, signed in August 2023, was intended to expedite BEN\u2019s entry into the automotive market. However, AFG\u2019s failure to provide access to the agreed-upon operational-ready data platform hindered BEN\u2019s ability to deliver its AI solutions to dealerships. BEN believes these issues caused significant delays in key automotive initiatives and irreparably damaged trust in the partnership. \u201cWe believe AFG\u2019s actions significantly disrupted our efforts to modernize dealership operations,\u201d said Paul Chang, Chief Executive Officer of BEN. \u201cTerminating the Agreement was essential to protect our strategy and enable us to focus on delivering impactful AI solutions to the automotive industry.\u201d \u201cThe ransomware attack occurred before we would have integrated any of our systems with AFG, and at no point were BEN\u2019s systems, data, or customers ever impacted,\u201d Chang added. BEN Prepares for 2025 Automotive AI Agent Rollout BEN is finalizing preparations to launch its Automotive AI Agent, a solution that integrates with major automotive data and service platform providers and supports over 13,000 dealerships nationwide. This initiative highlights BEN\u2019s strong commitment to the automotive sector. The AI Agent streamlines dealership operations by improving lead conversion, automating scheduling, enhancing service efficiency, and providing advanced analytics. Additionally, BEN plans to expand its efforts through pilot programs in the Midwest, stronger reseller partnerships in Mexico, and collaborations with Canadian dealership groups. These initiatives showcase BEN\u2019s dedication to delivering innovative, safe, scalable, and data-driven solutions to meet the evolving needs of automotive dealerships . AI Healthcare Solutions for Patient Engagement Continues to Expand BEN continues to expand its AI healthcare solutions to transform patient engagement and streamline communications.

By prioritizing robust data security and reducing administrative burdens, BEN empowers healthcare providers to focus on delivering high-quality care. Story Continues BEN Prioritizes Trust and Automotive Partnerships \u201cWe understand the importance of data security and trust in the automotive industry, in particular. The termination of this Agreement underscores our zero tolerance for actions that undermine trust,\u201d said Walid Khiari, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer of BEN. \u201cThis decisive step strengthens our ability to prioritize initiatives that benefit our automotive partners.\u201d About BEN Brand Engagement Network Inc.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Brand Engagement Network, Inc. (NASDAQ:BNAI) stands against the other AI stocks. Technology is advancing unprecedentedly, and physical AI seems to be the next leap forward. That\u2019s right, physical AI is going to be an incremental moment for mankind, where intelligent machines will have the ability to interact and manipulate their environment. Manifesting in robots and machines, these advanced systems can analyze their surroundings, use data to make decisions, and even physically interact with the world around them. READ NOW: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar This makes robotics makers, auto suppliers, and specialty semiconductor companies the next big winners in AI. While it initially started with search bots, technology is now moving to agentic AI, such as research assistants and customer service representatives. Naturally, the next focus is going to be technology that can interact with the physical world and act independently through artificial intelligence. According to analysts, this is where all the \u201cbig money\u201d is going to be. \u201cAs you go into 2025, agentic AI is that next inflection point here before you hit that physical AI moment ...\u00a0like with everything else in the world, you have to crawl before you can walk and then run. Gen AI hasn\u2019t really seen much monetization thus far. So when you start thinking about agentic AI and robotics and what have you, there\u2019s a real kind of belief out there \u2014 and expectation. You\u2019ll see those use cases start to come about this year\u201d. According to CNBC, Wall Street anticipates realistic AI-enabled agent applications to start appearing this year. Innovations in physical AI could begin coming out later, most likely beginning with self-driving cars. Physical AI has created \u201can additional leg to the stool\u201d to the AI build-out phase. \u201cThere\u2019s an additional driver now that augments what\u2019s going on today and AI broadly\u201d. According to CEO Jensen Huang, \u201cthe ChatGPT moment for general robotics is just around the corner\u201d. He said that the company anticipates enabling the development of three key robots in the coming years: agentic agents, self-driving vehicles, and humanoid robots. In this respect, he has also introduced Nvidia\u2019s Cosmos platform for companies looking to train and develop physical AI systems. According to a recent Nvidia press release, the Cosmos platform can generate physics-based videos from several inputs, like video, image text, as well as robot sensor and motion data. Story Continues Here is what Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch thinks about Physical AI: \u201cWe see physical AI as a nascent interdisciplinary field poised to transform the industrial complex through increased asset productivity and labor efficiency. We see outsized investment return potential in sensing, sensor fusion, compute hardware & software architecture, connectivity, controls, and AI training strategies\u201d.

Effective in Destruction of Kidney Tumors with 88.7% Recurrence-Free Rate Based on Interim ICESECRET Study Results PR Newswire Thu, Dec 5, 2024, 4:30 PM 4 min read In This Article: ICCM +0.80% Data confirm previous results showing that ProSense \u00ae cryoablation is highly effective for kidney tumors < 3 cm and a safe procedure for kidney tumors < 5 cm in people ineligible for surgery Interim results presented at the Israeli Urological Association Conference in Eilat, Israel ProSense \u00ae is approved for benign and malignant kidney tumors in the U.S., Europe and numerous other countries CAESAREA, Israel , Dec. 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- IceCure Medical Ltd. (NASDAQ: ICCM) ('IceCure', 'IceCure Medical' or the 'Company'), developer of minimally-invasive cryoablation technology that destroys tumors by freezing as an alternative to surgical tumor removal, today announced interim results from the Company's ICESECRET study of cryoablation for patients with small renal masses ('SRM') who cannot be offered kidney preserving surgery. Data were presented on December 5, 2024 at the Israeli Urological Association Conference in Eilat, Israel . The presentation titled 'Renal Mass Cryoablation - Interim Analysis of ICESECRET Study' was delivered by Dr. Keren Boguslavsky of Bnai Zion Medical Center. IceCure_Medical_Logo Results were reported at a mean follow-up period of 36 months for 111 patients with 117 lesions. A summary of the key results were: In 91 patients (approximately 82%), no tumor recurrence was observed. Following an additional cryoablation procedure for the same tumor in 13 patients, the success rate for the overall population was 83.8%, with a mean follow-up time of 39.6 months. In patients without a history of kidney cancer with one tumor < 3 cm, the success rate was 88.7%. Freezing of the renal tumor, including safety margins of 0.5 cm, was achieved in 95.6% of the procedures demonstrating high efficacy in cases without anatomic limitation for ice ball creation. Four procedure-related serious adverse events were reported, three of which were mild and treated conservatively. One severe complication was observed seven months after the cryoablation procedure. Renal function was preserved, on an average basis across the patient cohort, with no significant change in creatinine and hemoglobin levels compared to baseline. The procedure time, relative to the standard of care as supported by and documented in medical literature, was short at approximately 25 minutes. \"The ability to offer cryoablation for kidney cancer is a large unmet need, particularly in patients who are ineligible for kidney preserving surgery. We are very pleased that ICESECRET's latest interim results present ProSense \u00ae as a safe and effective option for these patients. These results are particularly important since ProSense \u00ae is already approved for the as a cryosurgical tool in the destruction of malignant and benign tumors of the kidney in key markets including the U.S. and Europe ,\" stated IceCure's Chief Executive Officer, Eyal Shamir . Story Continues According to the American Journal of Roentgenology, small renal masses, which may be malignant or benign tumors in the kidney, have been increasing in incidence over the past two decades. According to the American Cancer Society, in 2024, in the United States , an estimated 81,610 new cases of kidney cancer will have been diagnosed, with approximately 14,390 dying from the disease. Globally , there were more than 434,000 new cases of kidney cancer in 2022 and about 156,000 deaths according to World Cancer Research Fund International. About ICESECRET ICESECRET, a prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical trial is being performed at Bnai Zion Medical Center in Haifa, Israel and Shamir Medical Center in Zerifin, Israel and is being led by Principal Investigator Prof. Halahmi Sarel. The trial includes 114 patients (138 lesions) with localized SRM of \u22645 cm that were ablated with ProSense \u00ae cryoablation under CT guidance. Follow-up visits are performed six weeks, six months, one year, and then annually up to five years after the procedure. During the follow-up visits, data related to local recurrence, based on CT imaging, is collected. Safety was determined by monitoring procedure-related adverse events throughout the study. About ProSense \u00ae The ProSense \u00ae Cryoablation\u00a0System is a minimally invasive cryosurgical tool that provides the option to destroy tumors by freezing them.

Montclair might be the place for you Maddie McGay, NorthJersey.com Updated Fri, Nov 8, 2024, 5:13 PM 16 min read So, you're considering making the move to Montclair? Situated in northern Essex County between communities like Glen Ridge and West Orange, some may view Montclair as an overrated commuter town with an expensive lifestyle, dormant social scene and haughty attitude. But with a population of residents that is passionate about community engagement, neighborhoods that are filled with historic homes and a trendy downtown area with a booming arts and food scene, Montclair might really be worth the hype. Is the perception of Montclair \u2014 a quiet and congested suburb with overpriced homes and uppish residents \u2014 the reality? Don't worry, we've got you covered. Here's your guide to deciding whether Montclair is right for you. The draw of Montclair Perception: Despite all of its praise, Montclair is just a congested commuter town with a sleepy social scene and overpriced housing. Reality: A diverse and bustling hub in North Jersey, Montclair is know for its rich arts, culture and dining scene. The artsy suburb is also home to trendy shops, favors all different types of lifestyles and offers plenty of ways to get involved in the community. Sometimes referred to as \"The Park Slope of New Jersey,\" Montclair is a trendy and historic suburb in the foothills of the Watchung Mountains. The town spans 6.3 square miles in Essex County and is home to a diverse population of about 40,000 residents, all within about 17 miles of Midtown Manhattan. Given its proximity to New York City, the town is often a popular choice among North Jersey commuters. \"It\u2019s a very diverse community and there\u2019s a lot of community spirit. Also it\u2019s proximity to New York City makes it the best of both worlds,\" said Jackie Apicella, marketing and events director for the Montclair Center BID and director of Experience Montclair. \"We have that New York charm, but we also have the suburban life.\" Montclair is broken up into six main districts: Montclair Center, Watchung Plaza, Walnut Street, Frog Hollow, South End and Upper Montclair. Each of these districts offer their own array of local businesses and restaurants, as well as a variety of different housing styles. June Raegner, a broker associate with Stanton Company Realtors, said Montclair is unique in that there is not just one type of person that calls the town home. Having these different districts and a variety of neighborhoods lends Montclair to be an appealing place for many different demographics. \"It's not like a lot of these commuter towns that are like Wall Street. There's finance sector people, there's a lot of people in advertising, there's a lot of media people, there's a lot of film production people and there's a lot of writers,\" she said. \"You've always had people who do a lot of different things, which I actually think has really insulated the town in economic downturns.\" Similarly, Apicella said that whether you're looking to be in the thick of the town's hustle and bustle, or would prefer a more quiet lifestyle, there's a place in Montclair for you. If you want to be close by to the downtown area and always visit the town's different events, Montclair Center might be your best best. Or if you want an environment that's more relaxed, but still within close distance of the downtown, Upper Montclair could appeal to you. Our series, Move Right In, explores what it's like to live in different areas of North Jersey. And despite having residents with so many different lifestyles and interests, Montclair has managed to maintain a close-knit community that prides itself on getting involved in what the town has to offer. Apicella said that when she's out and about in Montclair, it's nearly impossible to not run into someone you know. \"I'll be going out and it's like, 'There's Bob from the shoe store,' and 'Oh, there's Sally who I met at the Jazz Festival,'\" she said. \"The great part about Montclair is really the community. It's kind of like the whole 'Cheers' thing, like where everybody knows your name.\" As for amenities, Montclair is home to supermarkets like Acme, Kings Food Markets and Whole Foods. And while Montclair does not have any major shopping centers, it is full of local businesses in each of its six main districts. Apicella said that one of the biggest highlights of Montclair is its booming dining scene. Between Michelin-starred chefs, restaurants owned by celebrity chefs and more than 100 spots that offer outdoor dining, she said its impossible to name just how many options are available. To name a few, there's Faubourg, Nami Nori, Masaharu Morimoto, Le Salbuen, Marcel, Ray's Luncheonette, The Corner and much more. Montclair real estate Residential houses on Walnut St in Montclair on Thursday, Oct. 3, 2024. Perception: Montclair is an affluent community, so the town must only offer multi-million dollar homes and luxury rentals. Reality: Montclair is known for being one of North Jersey's priciest suburbs, and therefore housing here is more expensive than other North Jersey towns. But sale and rental prices do vary. Raegner said that home prices in Montclair have rapidly increased over the last several years. But she noted that potential buyers should keep in mind that this is not a unique issue to Montclair. \"I say this all the time, but it's not just a Montclair problem. It's an east coast and tri-state area problem,\" she said. \"Having these rapidly escalating prices is pricing people out who have been here for generations. It's great that our biggest financial investment is rapidly increasing in value. But as far as it being a healthy dynamic for the town, it's not.\" Still, those considering a possible move to Montclair should expect to pay a pretty penny for a home here. The median listing price for a home in Montclair was about $1.15 million in September, according to Realtor.com . As of mid-October, listing prices range anywhere from $249,000 for a studio condo on Valley Road to as much as $17 million for an eight-bedroom, 11-bathroom estate on Club Way . But a majority of homes listing for sale in Montclair sit in the $600,000 to $1 million price range. When it comes to the styles of homes available in Montclair, the town is known for having a high supply of historically-significant properties. Expect to see classic architectural styles like Colonial Revival, Queen Anne, Tudor, Georgian and Craftsman, as well as homes that feature a mix of these styles. \"\"We have a lot of different neighborhoods and I would say a majority of our housing stock was built in the 1920s, 1930s and early 1940s. So we have amazing architecture,\" Raegner said. \"We have a lot of houses that were built by really interesting and special architects who either lived in Montclair or who did work in Montclair. That's a really neat part about being a realtor here. There's so many cool and special houses.\" And if you're someone who isn't looking to permanently settle down quite yet or just prefer renting over owning, there is an abundance of rentals available in Montclair. Raegner said that housing in Montclair is about 35% rentals, which is a higher-than-usual amount for most towns. These rentals primarily consist of those found in newer luxury buildings \u2014 like Two South Willow Apartments, Alister Montclair and Valley & Bloom \u2014 or other existing rental communities in Montclair, such as Montclair Gardens, the Whitehall Apartments and Eagle Rock Apartments. There are rentals sometimes available in multi-family houses as well, but Raegner said that there have been less of these units available over time. \"Montclair is interesting in that there was a big push, I would say in the 70s and 80s, where people took all these huge homes and made them into multi-family homes,\" Raegner said. \"There's been an update to fire code, building code and rent control since then, so we actually do see people buying those and returning them to these enormous single-family homes. That's kind of an interesting dynamic, which is actually a shame because it takes more of the more affordable rentals off the market.\" As for pricing, Montclair's town council passed a rent control ordinance in 2022. This ordinance applies to rental units within a building, but excludes single-family homes and owner-occupied housing that contain three or fewer rental units. Additionally, because of state law, Raegner said this rent control can only apply to buildings that were built within the last 30 years. She said this means that this rent control ordinance does apply to many buildings in Montclair, but will not apply the new luxury rental buildings that are constantly being introduced. Overall, you can expect to pay anywhere from about $1,600 for a one-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment on Bay Street to as much as $6,000 for a four-bedroom, three-bathroom home on Orange Road or $8,000 for a three-bedroom, three-bathroom townhouse on Walnut Street . Activities in Montclair People past under The Clairidge, a movie theater, on Bloomfield Ave in Montclair on Thursday, Oct. 3, 2024. Perception: Because Montclair is known for its arts and culture scene, the town must be home to mostly music, art and film events. Reality: In addition to its abundance of arts and culture attractions, the town is also home to thriving local businesses, public parks and a variety of highly-rated restaurants. Because Montclair is a popular hub for artists, musicians, filmmakers and other creatives, the town is full of attractions for those looking to foster these interests. And most of these can be located in the town's downtown arts district, known as Montclair Center. The Montclair Art Museum \u2014 founded in 1914 and featuring a diverse collection of more than 12,000 works \u2014 regularly updates its exhibits, and hosts a variety of workshops and events throughout the year. There's also the Montclair History Center , which stewards three historic houses on Orange Road and showcases the local history. For theaters, The Claridge \u2014 a six-screen theater owned by non-profit Montclair Film \u2014 holds screenings of recently-released films and is home to the annual Montclair Film Festival. And for live entertainment, The Wellmont Theater constantly has a calendar full of musical arts, comedy acts and more. Other arts and culture events in Montclair include the annual Jazz Festival, Light Up Diwali, Walnut Street Fair, Rose Squared Art Show and more. Apicella said the Montclair Center BID often hosts events throughout the year as well, such as the annual fall Art Walk. \"Right now, there's like 100 fall events that happen within Montclair, both big and small. Big means like the Jazz Festival and the Film Festival, but we have zombie walks and a haunted house. We have a winter wonderland in the winter,\" Apicella said. \"We have all sorts of different things throughout the districts.\" Edgemont Memorial Park in Montclair on Thursday, Oct. 3, 2024. Montclair is also home to an abundance of green spaces, with approximately 175 acres of parks . This includes Edgemont Memorial Park, Glenfield Park, Anderson Park, Nishuane Park, Mountainside Park and more. You can also visit the Brookdale Park Rose Garden and the Van Vleck House and Gardens, which features an array of brightly colored flowers during the peak blooming months. The Montclair Public Library \u2014 opened in 1893 after the town's residents voted to create a free public library \u2014 has two locations open to the public today: the main library branch on S. Fullerton Avenue and the Bellevue Avenue branch. You can enjoy a selection of books, audiobooks, movies and games from these libraries, or participate in clubs, workshops and other events.

Commute from Montclair An NJ Transit train arrives at the Watchung Ave Station in Montclair on Thursday, Oct. 3, 2024. Perception: Located about 17 miles from Midtown Manhattan, Montclair offers residents a convenient commute to New York City and surrounding North Jersey towns. Reality: Montclair is known for having a large commuter population, with residents having access to several train stations, bus lines and highways in and around the town. Montclair is home to, or within close proximity to, several commuting methods, making it an ideal town for those who have to regularly commute to New York City and nearby North Jersey towns. In fact, Montclair has consistently ranked as one of New Jersey's best commuter towns. \"Although we are close to the city, you'd need to figure out if you're commuting and working in the city. What part of Montclair makes sense for that?\" Apicella said. \"You'd have to look into that if you were going to be a commuter to make sure it makes sense for you, whether you'd be taking the bus as opposed to the train.\" For train service, Montclair has six different train stations: Bay Street Station, Walnut Street Station, Watchung Avenue Station, Upper Montclair Station, Mountain Avenue Station and Montclair Heights Station. All six of these stations are serviced by NJ Transit's Montclair-Boonton Line, which runs directly to New York Penn Station \u2014 including stops at Newark Broad Street and Secaucus Junction for transfers to Hoboken \u2014\u00a0on weekdays. The trip from Montclair to New York City takes anywhere from 40 minutes to an hour, depending on the time of day and which train station you use. And a month worth of rides will cost you anywhere from $241 to $261, when purchasing an unlimited monthly pass, if you have to commute regularly. On weekends though, the Montclair-Boonton Line does not regularly travel directly to New York Penn Station. A direct train to Midtown Manhattan runs every hour on the weekends only at Bay Street Station. Otherwise, most trains run to Hoboken instead, so those looking to travel to Secaucus Junction or New York Penn Station will have to transfer trains at Newark Broad Street. DeCamp Bus Lines permanently stopped commuter service into New York City from places like Montclair in 2023, limiting the options for commuting by bus from here to Port Authority. NJ Transit bus routes 101 and 191 are currently the only public buses available for those looking to travel directly from Montclair to Port Authority. With a limited number of these buses running \u2014 check the schedules for times \u2014 the trip takes about an hour and costs commuters $192 for a monthly pass. For private bus services, Boxcar Transit offers weekday rides for those commuting to Midtown Manhattan. No major highways run straight through Montclair, but there are several just a short distance away for those who prefer to drive. This includes the Garden State Parkway, Route 280, Route 3 and Route 46. Depending on the area of town, though, residents often stress that finding parking in Montclair is difficult. So, keep that in mind if you choose to commute by driving. Montclair schools Montclair High School in Montclair on Thursday, Oct. 3, 2024. Perception: Because Montclair tends to foster a wealthy lifestyle, most residents must send their children to private schools and therefore the public school system must be lacking. Reality: While some students in Montclair may attend private schools, many students are enrolled in the town's public schools system. The district tends to be highly-rated in New Jersey and actually provides specialized education between its different schools. With 11 schools within its district, Montclair Public Schools serves more than 6,000 students. The district has what is known as a magnet system \u2014 established in 1977 \u2014 where each school offers a specialized program based on specific areas of study.

There are seven elementary schools in the Montclair school system. This includes Nishuane Elementary School (pre-K-2) and Hillside Elementary School (3-5) for students considered to be gifted and talented, as well as Bradford Elementary School (pre-K-5) \u2014 known as \"The University Magnet\" for its partnership with Montclair State University. The remaining elementary schools are K-5 and offer different magnet themes: Charles H. Bullock Elementary School (liberal arts), Edgemont Montessori School (Montessori), Northeast Elementary School (global studies) and Watchung Elementary School (science and technology). For students in sixth through eighth grade, there are three middle schools. This includes Buzz Aldrin Middle School, specializing in STEM, Renaissance Middle School for liberal arts and Glenfield Middle School for visual and performing arts. And Montclair High School services students in ninth through 12th grade. Overall, Montclair Public Schools is considered to be an above average school district in North Jersey.

And outside of the public school system, there are also several preschool programs in Montclair. This includes Early Explorers Preschool, Montclair Community Pre-K, Park Street Academy and Parkside Montessori School. The Montclair social scene Montclair Brewery on Walnut St in Montclair on Thursday, Oct. 3, 2024.
