Presents Data at ASCO GI Demonstrating Impact of BOT/BAL in Colorectal Cancer Across Neoadjuvant and Advanced Disease Business Wire Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 10:48 PM 9 min read In This Article: AGEN -7.63% Results from two independent neoadjuvant studies in the U.S. and Europe, enrolling more than 80 patients, underscore BOT/BAL\u2019s potential to enable chemo-free and non-operative approaches in colorectal cancer (CRC). New randomized Phase 2 results in over 230 patients with refractory MSS mCRC, consistent with Phase 1 data, demonstrate durable responses and a favorable safety profile. Strong activity demonstrated with BOT/BAL in first-line and rechallenged MSS mCRC in combination with chemotherapy and targeted therapies shows synergy and tolerability in a large patient population. LEXINGTON, Mass., January 22, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Agenus Inc. (Nasdaq: AGEN ), a leader in immuno-oncology, today shared new data on botensilimab (BOT) and balstilimab (BAL) at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium (ASCO GI) in San Francisco. Data from five presentations underscore the transformative potential of BOT/BAL across multiple lines of therapy in colorectal cancer, including neoadjuvant, first-line, and refractory settings. Data presented also highlight BOT/BAL\u2019s potential in treating microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC tumors, which account for 85-95% 1 of patients living with CRC that historically have been unresponsive to immuno-oncology (I/O) therapies. To date, BOT/BAL has been evaluated in approximately 1,100 patients across more than 60 centers worldwide. \"Data presented at ASCO GI highlight botensilimab and balstilimab\u2019s potential to redefine colorectal cancer treatment, delivering remarkable outcomes in neoadjuvant MSS CRC,\" said Dr. Steven O\u2019Day, Chief Medical Officer of Agenus . \"These findings set the stage for pivotal studies intended to create a new standard of care for colon and rectal cancer patients by reducing reliance on chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery, while improving survival.\" Key Data Highlights Neoadjuvant CRC: A Potential Path to Chemo-Free Treatment Data presented from two independent studies, UNICORN and NEST, collectively include more than 80 patients treated with BOT/BAL: UNICORN : Phase 2 Trial of Pre-Operative BOT/BAL Combination Treatment in Resectable Colon Cancer (Abstract 158): This multicenter Phase 2 study enrolled 56 patients across 10 centers in Italy and France. Pathological complete responses (pCR) and pathological major responses (pMR) were observed in both the pMMR/MSS and dMMR/MSI-H patient populations. BOT/BAL achieved a 93% pCR rate and 100% pMR in dMMR/MSI-H tumors and 29% pCR rate and 36% pMR rate in pMMR/MSS tumors, highlighting the opportunity for a non-operative, organ sparing, approach in this disease setting. Serious adverse events (AEs) occurred in 9 pts (16%) and were treatment-related in 3 pts (5%). Only 1 of 56 surgeries were delayed due to an AE. NEST : Phase 2 Trial of Neoadjuvant Combination Treatment of BOT/BAL in Patients with Resectable Colon Cancer (Abstract 207): This trial has currently enrolled 24 patients. After median follow-up of 18 months (NEST-1 arm) and 9 months (NEST-2 arm), all patients (100%) remained ctDNA negative and no clinical recurrences were observed. The pMR improved in NEST-2 to 47% (7/15) in MSS tumors when the median time to surgery was extended. The combination was well tolerated with no grade 4 events and no unresolved immune-mediated adverse events (imAEs). No delays in surgery occurred due to imAEs. Story Continues Dr. Filippo Pietrantonio, Department of Medical Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori Milan comments on the UNICORN study stating, \" These results further validate the transformative potential of botensilimab and balstilimab in colorectal cancer. The remarkable pathological response rates observed in both pMMR and dMMR tumors highlight the unique strength of this combination in addressing a critical unmet need and pave the way for non-operative management strategies.\" First-Line and FOLFOX Rechallenged MSS CRC: Powerful Combination with Standard Therapies Phase 1/2 Trial of BOT/BAL With FOLFOX-Bevacizumab in MSS mCRC (Abstract 180): Preliminary findings showed activity of combination independent of liver metastases. In the initial 14 patients, 12 which were previously treated with FOLFOX, a 71% overall response rate (ORR) was achieved. In the 9/14 patients with liver metastases, a 67% ORR was achieved. The combination was well-tolerated with limited severe imAEs, supporting the opportunity for higher doses of BOT. Refractory MSS CRC: Consistent Results Across Phase 1 and 2 Studies Global Randomized Phase 2 Study of BOT/BAL in MSS mCRC NLM (Abstract 23): This is a global Phase 2 trial (NCT05608044) of BOT/BAL versus standard-of-care treatments of regorafenib or trifluridine/tipiracil in patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer that had spread to either peritoneum, lymph nodes, lungs, bone or brain. 234 patients were enrolled across 40 centers worldwide. These results reinforce the activity and safety seen in the Phase 1 study and confirm the contribution of BAL to BOT. BOT75/BAL achieved a 19% ORR and 55% disease control rate (DCR) in this refractory population. Standard of care had no responses. 70% of responses were ongoing at the time of data cut-off, demonstrating durability as DOR continues to mature. BOT/BAL showed a superior benefit-risk profile at 75 mg compared to BOT/BAL 150mg and has been selected for Phase 3 trials. No new safety signals were observed, and no treatment related deaths occurred. The most common imAEs at BOT 75mg + BAL included diarrhea/colitis (35%) and hypothyroidism (13%). \"The Phase 2 results highlight the unique and consistent activity of the botensilimab and balstilimab combination, demonstrating a compelling objective response rate in microsatellite stable metastatic colorectal cancer, a disease where responses to immunotherapy have historically been absent,\" said Dr. Marwan Fakih, Department of Medical Oncology and Therapeutics Research, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center. \"These findings underscore the potential of botensilimab and balstilimab combination treatment in addressing this critical unmet need, paving the way for further investigation.\" Gastric Cancer Phase 2 BOT/BAL/AgenT-797 in Combination with Ramucirumab and Paclitaxel in Patients with Previously Treated, Unresectable or Metastatic Gastroesophageal Cancers (Abstract TPS515): The Phase 2 trial (NCT06251973) is investigating a novel combination approach, which leverages cellular therapy and immune modulation to address the unmet needs in gastroesophageal cancers. Gastroesophageal cancers continue to be a growing global burden responsible for nearly 1.3 million global deaths annually 2 . The novel approach demonstrated early signals of activity and tolerability in the second-line treatment setting, with additional efficacy data anticipated in 2H 2025. Future Development Plans Agenus has developed registrational enabling trials in MSS CRC across neoadjuvant, first-line, and late-line settings. These trials will launch upon completion of strategic transactions. Upon the options being considered are, partnerships, licensing, or joint ventures. These initiatives aim to accelerate global access to BOT/BOL to deliver transformative patient outcomes and drive substantial value for stakeholders. Botensilimab, balstilimab, and agenT-797 are investigational agents and are not approved for use as therapies in any jurisdiction worldwide.

Semi-Autonomous Venture Capital Fund Identifies and Supports Innovation in AI Tools that Execute Complex Business Tasks, a Multi-Trillion Dollar Opportunity in 2025 SEATTLE , Jan. 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Agent Fund , a semi-autonomous venture capital fund investing in AI autonomous agent startups, launched today on AngelList led by Yohei Nakajima (GP at Untapped Capital and creator of BabyAGI), Adam Silverman , and Alex Reibman (co-founders of Agen.cy AI and creators of AgentOps.ai ,). Agent Fund focuses on identifying and supporting innovative startups within the burgeoning autonomous agent ecosystem, and will operate semi-autonomously itself by leveraging AI for deal\u00a0sourcing, due diligence, portfolio management and community-building. Autonomous agents represent the next evolution of AI tools, transcending simple prompts and API calls to dynamically decide what to do based on objectives, and utilizing tools, memory, and reasoning to execute complex tasks. Nakajima created Baby AGI in April 2022 , a fully autonomous task manager that can create, track, prioritize and execute a company's projects using artificial intelligence. Since then, hundreds of founders have reached out to him for funding, inspiring a separate investment strategy. He teamed up with Silvernam and Reibman who help businesses build AI agents and were also seeking an investment strategy. \"Agent Fund is the perfect playground for startups who are pushing the boundaries of what we can automate with AI,\" said Nakajima. \"Our goal is to build a large, collaborative community of autonomous agent startups and for the Fund to be semi-autonomous itself. We will still have people making key decisions, but leverage AI across all aspects of the business from sourcing deals to selecting the people to invest in and managing the portfolio.\" AI agents are a multi-trillion dollar opportunity 1 and Agent Fund is well positioned to fuel innovation in this space with its extensive network, bolstered by the global recognition of BabyAGI. Agent Fund supports startups at scale, covering diverse use cases from infrastructure to AI employees, enterprise tools, and no-code solutions, making it a preferred partner for top-tier startups. Agent Fund is structured as a rolling fund on AngelList, with individual investments ranging from $50,000 - $200,000 each.

Buy Stock Zacks Equity Research Mon, Jan 20, 2025, 8:00 PM 3 min read In This Article: AGEN -7.63% Agenus (AGEN) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change. A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years. Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Agenus basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price. Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock. For Agenus, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher. Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>. Story Continues Earnings Estimate Revisions for Agenus This biotechnology company is expected to earn -$12.84 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2024, which represents a year-over-year change of 7%. Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Agenus. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 13.3%. Bottom Line Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term. You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>> The upgrade of Agenus to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.

news and updates on Trump's tariffs Skate City: New York is a mobile game that manuals the line between casual and deep play It's out today on Apple Arcade. Engadget \u00b7 Snowman / Agens Nathan Ingraham \u00b7 Deputy Editor, News Fri, Jan 10, 2025, 10:15 PM 5 min read Skate City was an Apple Arcade launch title way back in 2019, developed by Agens and published by Snowman, a company well-known for its mobile-first games like Alto's Adventure, the \"sequel\" Alto's Odyssey , When Cards Fall and a handful of other intriguing titles. It's been over five years since Skate City first arrived, but the Snowman / Agens team is back with Skate City: New York , which is out on Apple Arcade today. There have been a number of content updates to the original game over the years, but this is a full-fledged new title that feels quite familiar but also has a number of improvements and updates. I had a chance to try Skate City: New York a few days before its launch, and I also spoke with Snowman's Ryan Cash and Andrew Schimmel about the new game, which they said has been in the works for a good three years now. As with the first Skate City, you're rolling left-to-right in classic side-scrolling format here. To make things accessible, you can pull off tricks by swiping in one of eight directions on the lower half of the screen; the left side is for ollie-based tricks while the right shifts you to nollie. You don't have to do anything precise to land, just launch the trick and the game will make sure you hit the ground rolling (unless you land on stairs or an obstacle, of course). That's the basic starting point, but you can also do spins, manuals, grinds and more. It's simpler than a game like the classic Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series or the recent OlliOlli World , but there's still a lot of timing and dexterity involved in really nailing your runs. As you'd expect, the visuals are more dynamic and the backgrounds are much-improved over the original (which was still a lovely game). But what sets this one apart the most, according to Schimmel, is the fact the \"Pro Skate\" mode, which is the most involved part of the game, uses procedurally-generated levels. \"We didn't want to limit ourselves to the original [game's] loops through the city, but instead make something that was more adaptive and dynamic,\" Schimmel said. \"Procedural generation was the answer and the biggest technical challenge.\" It's not something that I was able to pick up on immediately, since I've only played the game for a couple hours, but Schimmel's confident it'll make Skate City: New York have even more replay-ability than the original. Skate City: New York \u00b7 Snowman / Agens Pro Skate reminds me a lot of Snowman's Alto's Adventure, but translated to skating \u2014 the goal is to go as far as you can and rack up as many points as possible while completing three objectives to level your progress up. Objectives are things like \"land three 180-degree spins\" or \"grind for 100 meters.\" But with levels more unpredictable than in the prior game, you'll need to be better at reacting on-the-fly to new obstacles, which can end your run but also give you an opportunity for a good grind or trick. Story Continues As with all of Snowman's games, there are no in-app purchases here; instead, you'll get points for completing challenges and leveling up in Pro Skate. You can then use those to customize your character with the much more flexible and expanded Skate Shop. You can tweak your character's body, hair, facial characteristics, clothes, skateboard and so forth. I haven't played around with it a ton yet but it's obviously right off the bat that there's a lot more personalization here. As with Skate City , Snowman promises that there will be a steady stream of fresh challenges and more parts of the city to explore over the next year and beyond. Schimmel referred to it as a \"live services\" game even though there's no monetization aspect to it. I also asked how the team decided to release Skate City: New York through Apple Arcade versus having it be a one-time payment or even including paid updates in the game \u2014 Cash called it an \"easy choice.\" \"We haven\u2019t done a paid up-front game since Alto's Odyssey in 2018,\" Cash said. \"Apple Arcade and Netflix Games are where we're at right now. And it was an easy choice when talking about Skate City: New York, because the first game was a launch title and found a lot of success there. It just made sense to bring it back to Apple Arcade.\" The first Skate City eventually came to consoles and PC, as well, and Cash said that was definitely under consideration for the future, but the goal is to make a mobile-first title as good as it can be. While the game doesn't feel wildly different than its predecessor, Skate City: New York still feels like a premium mobile game at a time when those can be hard to find. And Snowman and Agens have done a great job of balancing the pick-up-and-play aspects of a good mobile game with a deeper experience, at least from what I've seen so far. \"We want a seven-year-old who's excited about skateboarding to have fun,\" Cash said, \"as well as people like us who grew up loving skateboarding and really want a challenge.\" Skate City: New York is out today exclusively on Apple Arcade.

Trump's tariffs This Tech Stock Could Dominate the Market for Agentic AI. Here's Why. Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool Tue, Jan 7, 2025, 1:49 PM 5 min de lectura En este art\u00edculo: CRM -0.72% NVDA -2.84% 2025 is shaping up to be the year of artificial intelligence (AI) software. Over the last two years, the AI boom has focused on semiconductor stocks like Nvidia , but after building out data centers to perform generative AI computing scale, software companies now seem next up to capitalize on the new tech boom. Tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush recently said, \"The time has come for the broader software space to get in on the AI Party as we believe the use cases are exploding.\" Agentic AI is rapidly becoming a buzzword in the industry as using AI via autonomous agents seems to be one of the most immediate applications of generative AI beyond chatbots. Through agentic AI, AI technology can autonomously solve difficult problems using sophisticated reasoning and multistep planning. Companies are rapidly building their agentic AI tools, but one that looks poised to be a leader in the new technology is Salesforce 's (NYSE: CRM) Agentforce. Image source: Getty Images. What Salesforce is doing with agentic AI Salesforce is one of the oldest pure-play cloud software stocks , and it's long led the market for customer relationship management (CRM) software, so the company figures to be a favorite in Agentic AI. Like Nvidia and other AI leaders, Salesforce is building on years of work and data with its new AI product, Agentforce. The company introduced Agentforce at its Dreamforce conference in September. Agentforce allows users to build and customize autonomous AI agents that can serve employees and customers 24/7. Salesforce says that Agentforce resolves 83% of visitor requests on its help site, and its usage spans Salesforce's product suite from CRM to Slack to Tableau. Those touchpoints and Salesforce's 25-year history give it deeper customer relationships than most of its competitors, and CEO Marc Benioff explained on the company's recent earnings call that agentic AI and Agentforce have significantly expanded the company's total addressable market (TAM), saying, \"We've really created a whole new market, a new TAM, a TAM that is so much bigger and so much more exciting than the data management market, it's hard to get our head completely around.\" Salesforce has already signed 200 deals with Agentforce, and Benioff described the pipeline as \"incredible.\" Part of the reason stocks have soared on AI is that the technology has the power to greatly scale productivity, and Agentforce is one of the first tools to tap into that. Benioff said, \"This is really a moment where productivity is no longer tied to workforce growth, but through this intelligent technology that can be scaled without limits.\" Leer m\u00e1s What it means for Salesforce Salesforce's revenue growth rate has slowed substantially from pre-pandemic levels, coming in at just 8.3% in the third quarter, and there isn't evidence yet in its forecast that Agentforce is moving the needle. For the fourth quarter, the company guided for 7% to 9% revenue growth, and for remaining performance obligations (RPO) growth of 9%, referring to the growth of its backlog over the next year. It will likely take a few more quarters for Agentforce and Agentic AI to begin to impact the company's growth as it just launched the product in September. A product like Agentforce also has the potential to deliver high-margin profits for Salesforce as the product, like software generally, is highly scalable and the marginal cost of delivering it for additional customers is essentially zero. Once the intellectual property is created, the costs are primarily associated with the cloud computing power necessary to run it. The research and development necessary to create the product has already been done, though Salesforce is likely to improve on it, meaning that the incremental revenue from Agentforce should be mostly profit. That helps explain why cloud infrastructure companies have been willing to spend tens of billions of dollars on Nvidia components to build out AI infrastructure. The potential of software programs like Agentforce is massive as it's a huge value-add and productivity improvement that Salesforce's customers are likely to pay up for. It's unclear how much Agentforce will expand Salesforce's TAM and drive its growth, but investors should heed Benioff's words above. The new technology is likely to be a game changer for Salesforce.

Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 5:35 PM 2 min read In This Article: AGEN -7.63% Agenus (AGEN) has been beaten down lately with too much selling pressure. While the stock has lost 41.6% over the past four weeks, there is light at the end of the tunnel as it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts expect the company to report better earnings than they predicted earlier. Guide to Identifying Oversold Stocks We use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30. Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal. So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound. However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision. Why a Trend Reversal is Due for AGEN The RSI reading of 16.18 for AGEN is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand. 3-month RSI Chart for AGEN This technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering AGEN in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 38.9% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term. Moreover, AGEN currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Garo, to highlight our progress in the third quarter. Garo H. Armen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Alexa, and good morning, everyone and thank you all for joining us today. At Agenus, we are driven by the belief that we can redefine, what is possible in cancer treatment. This belief is embodied in the progress, we've made with BOT/BAL. BOT/BAL is showing unprecedented results, in cancers that have resisted all previous therapies, as well as in patients with earlier stages of disease, who face morbidities associated with conventional treatment options, such as chemotherapy, radiation and radical and sometimes debilitating, or even mutilating surgeries. Story Continues BOT/BAL represents a paradigm shift, in how we approach cancer treatment. In the neoadjuvant setting, for example, BOT/BAL has demonstrated the potential to address diseases such as MSS colorectal cancer, which do not typically respond to immunotherapy and, which account for more than 85% of all colorectal cancer. The initial data we presented at ESMO GI in 2024, just a few months ago from the Cornell study highlights this potential. These results in a tumor type historically resistant to immunotherapy, are absolutely groundbreaking. Ongoing trials in Italy and the Netherlands will further expand on these results, and provide insights with data anticipated early next year. We believe these studies will reinforce the strength and breadth of BOT/BAL impact, not just in colorectal cancer, but across multiple cancers, which generally respond poorly to other treatments. While the science is advancing the financial challenges we face are significant. Developing therapies with this level of promise, requires significant resources, and we're operating under financial constraints. For example, we ended the quarter with just $44.8 million in cash, and subsequently raised another $7 million and change. These figures underscore the need for decisive action. Let me give you a glimpse of what we're doing. First, we've implemented measures that have significantly reduced cash outflows, ensuring we remain focused on our highest priorities, and internalizing as many extensive functions as possible, such as CRO and CDMO services, for which we have spent a significant amount of money in the first nine months of this year. Second, by the way, these were necessary expenditures, so but now we are internalizing this, as we wind down some of these activities as trials are maturing. Secondly, for the first time in almost a year, the window is opening up for us to monetize on our real estate assets. Remarkably, this effort has gained momentum with the improved financial environment, following the U.S. elections just a week ago. And the assets that we're talking about, are valued or they are appraised at our Vacaville property at over $45 million that's an appraisal about a year ago. And our Berkeley facility, which was our first manufacturing facility, which is appraised at $25 million. And thirdly, and most importantly, we are in advanced discussions on several strategic transactions, designed to deliver substantial value and resources. We see one or more, or a combination of these transactions, as key to our long-term growth, enabling us to sustain and accelerate our progress with BOT/BAL. These steps reflect our commitment to building a strong foundation for Agenus. One that allows us to deliver on the extraordinary promise of BOT/BAL, while meeting the needs of our patients and health. The progress we've made thus far is a testament to the strength of our science, and the dedication of our team. With that, I'll now turn it over to Dr. Robin Taylor, our chief commercial officer, to provide further insights into our business strategy, and patient access initiatives. Robin? Robin Taylor -- Chief Commercial Officer Thank you, Garo. And good morning, everyone. Building on Garo's remarks, I'd like to provide more detail on the strategic initiatives that are driving our progress. First, let's start with the clinical data. BOT/BAL's results are reshaping expectations for immunotherapy, especially in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, a setting that has been resistant to treatment, with prior immunotherapy approaches. These unprecedented outcomes, combined with data across multiple tumor types, are driving significant interest in BOT/BAL from key stakeholders, including the medical community, patient advocates and potential collaborators. From a business development perspective, we are actively engaged in discussions with pharmaceutical partners, regional collaborators, and other stakeholders to ensure BOT/BAL reaches its full potential. These discussions are focused on optimizing value creation, for both patients and shareholders. We are also advancing our compassionate use, and name patient programs globally, ensuring that patients with limited options will have broader access to BOT/BAL outside of clinical trials. These initiatives are critical for addressing the urgent needs of patients around the world. On the financial front, our strategy is built on a combination of operational discipline, asset monetization and strategic transactions. The recent uptick in market conditions, particularly following the U.S. Elections, has bolstered the value of our real estate and operational assets. We expect to close on these monetization opportunities soon, which will provide a bridge to a transformative transaction currently under active discussion. This transaction, which we anticipate finalizing in the near-term, is expected to bring in significant resources to support our mission, while optimizing long-term value for our shareholders. In summary, we are making significant strides in advancing BOT/BAL and positioning Agenus for long-term success. I'll now hand it over to Christine to discuss the financials. Christine M. Klaskin -- Vice President, Finance and Principal Financial Accounting Officer Thank you, Robin. Agenus ended the third quarter 2024, with a consolidated cash balance of $44.8 million, compared to $76.1 million on December 31, 2023. As Garo mentioned, we have raised $7.1 million through sales of common stock, under our market issuance sales agreement, since the end of the third quarter. Cash used in operations for the nine months ended September 2024 was $129.7 million. This is a reduction from spend of $183.8 million for the same period in 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognize revenue, which includes non-cash revenue of $25 million and $77 million respectively. This compares to $24 million and $7 million for the same periods in 2023. Net loss for the three and nine months ended Sept 30, 2024, is $67 million and $186 million, respectively. This net loss includes non-cash operating expenses, of $41 million for the third quarter and $112 million, for the nine months ended September. This compares to a net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 of $65 million and $20 million, respectively oh, sorry, $290 million respectively. I'll now turn the call back to Garo. Garo H. Armen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Robin and Christine. As we close, I want to leave you with a sense of what we are striving for Agenus. BOT/BAL is not just a new therapy. It is an opportunity to redefine the future of cancer treatment. And these are the sentiments of not just Agenus team members, but the sentiments of scores of clinicians around the world. BOT/BAL is an opportunity to redefine cancer treatment in ways that, we think will benefit patients in an unprecedented manner. In MSS, colorectal cancer and other hard-to-treat cancers. BOT/BAL is showing that it's possible to intervene earlier, more effectively, and with outcomes that could preserve not just the survival, but the quality of life that patients deserve. You will see significant evidence of that, at conference presentations very early next year. Two separate presentations representing two separate trials in the neoadjuvant setting. One in colorectal cancer, one in cancers that are across the board. This is why we are so committed to advancing this therapy. We know the financial challenges we face, and we are addressing them with deliberate and focused action. By reducing costs, monetizing assets, and advancing discussions on strategic transactions, we are laying the foundation for sustained progress. This is a critical moment for our company and for patients. The science is strong, the clinical momentum is real, and the opportunities ahead of us are extraordinary. But above all, this is about the patients, those who are counting on us to deliver hope and a path forward. I want to thank you for your continued support, and belief in our vision. We remain committed to realizing the full potential of BOT/BAL for the benefit of patients, shareholders, and the broader medical community. With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator? Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] The first question comes from the line of Emily Bodnar with H.C. Wainwright. Hold on a moment, please. Please go ahead. Emily Bodnar -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question, I guess. First one from me. Now, that you have guidance from the FDA and the EMA around the Phase 3 design, can you maybe just summarize how you're thinking about the Phase 3 design, and next steps and timelines for getting that study initiated? And then, on the three investigator trials that you mentioned in the neoadjuvant setting, can you maybe just go through each of those and kind of how the designs, for those studies differ and maybe set some expectations, to what we can see in the early 2025 data readout? Thank you. Garo H. Armen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer OK. So the first question I will ask Robin Taylor to answer, because he has been in deep discussions with potential collaborators and investors in the company, on this very issue. And the second question I'll ask our chief medical officer, Dr. Steven O'Day, to address. Robin Taylor -- Chief Commercial Officer Hi, Emily. So to address your question around the Phase 3 design and timing. We now have, as-you noted, we have feedback both from EMA and FDA that really allows us to proceed. Of course, we will do that when we have a strategic partnership that allows us, to be able to finance the study. And that can come in either through, our efforts on the financing side, or through a potential collaboration with a pharma partner. Both of which, we are in active discussions at the moment. And so, that is really the level of detail that we can provide at the moment. But we definitely are excited, by the fact that the door is now open for us to be able to proceed with that study. Garo H. Armen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And our two neoadjuvant studies beyond Cornell. There has been some concern Steven, that because of some personnel changes at Cornell, our neoadjuvant efforts had come to a halt. But in reality, it's just the opposite. In fact, we have extended that you can articulate without disclosing too much data, so that we don't jeopardize our presentation. Steven O'Day -- Chief Medical Officer Thank you, Emily, for the question. As we presented our NEST data, which is the Cornell data, at several conferences, most recently at ESMO GI, by updating that data, which continues to really be remarkable in the signal that it's giving in both MS stable and MS high colon cancer. There are two, as Garo referred to. There are two other data sets that are emerging, which will be presented in early 2025, both from Europe. One of them is a similar scenario to the Cornell in the sense that it's looking at colorectal cancer in the neoadjuvant setting with BOT and BAL. And we look forward to sharing that independent second data set in the setting, of what Cornell showed. And then, the other data set that's emerging from Europe, is from the Netherlands. And this will be a broader patient population that includes colorectal patients. But also includes other solid tumors that historically, have had major challenges, or had inability to respond to immunotherapy. So those are the two other data sets that, will be emerging in the first part of next year. Emily Bodnar -- Analyst Got it. OK. Makes sense. And then, maybe just lastly, on the Phase 2 relapsed refractory setting, do you see I believe previously you were saying you would have additional data, I believe, in first half of 2025. Is that still on track? Steven O'Day -- Chief Medical Officer Emily, thank you. Steve O'Day again. Yes, that data has continued to mature. The last patient was enrolled in the Phase 2 colorectal refractory study in November a year ago. And we look forward to continuing to allow that data to mature, and present it at a conference in early 2025. Emily Bodnar -- Analyst OK. Great. Thank you so much. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Matt Phipps with William Blair. Madeline Stone -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst Great. Hi, this is Madeline on for Matt. Thanks for taking our questions. First, should we expect any data from some of the cohorts, and other tumor types like melanoma and pancreatic cancer in the near-term, or could you provide any updated timing for those cohorts? Garo H. Armen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I mean, Steven O'Day will address that, but as we have generated data across approximately 10 children. And most recently at ESMO, we presented data on sarcoma. The data as it matures, is getting more and more compelling. And our investigators at places like ESMO that convene and discuss the prospects, for treating their patients in the future. Are very excited about the need to make BOT/BAL available for their patients on a wider scale. But Dr. O'Day is the gatekeeper of all of these efforts, and he'll give you more color on what we're going to be doing. Steven O'Day -- Chief Medical Officer So thank you for the question. In addition to our Phase 2 colorectal data, two other Phase 2 trials, as you mentioned, one in pancreas in a refractory setting, and one in melanoma in a very refractory setting, have completed accrual and are maturing. And we expect to have randomized data in-those settings in the first half of the next year. Madeline Stone -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst Great. Thank you.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $24.31 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Agenus shares have lost about 76.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 25.8%. What's Next for Agenus? While Agenus has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Agenus: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
