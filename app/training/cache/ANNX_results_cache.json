(Nasdaq: ANNX), a biopharmaceutical company advancing a late-stage clinical platform of novel therapies for people living with devastating classical complement-mediated neuroinflammatory diseases of the body, brain, and eye, today announced its 2025 outlook and key catalysts for its flagship programs: ANX005 in Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), ANX007 in geographic atrophy (GA), and oral small molecule ANX1502 for a host of diseases. \u201cFounded ten years ago, Annexon has pursued an intentional path to transform the complement landscape and thereby drive immense value by effectively translating our pioneering science into potential treatments for millions of patients suffering from complement-mediated neuroinflammatory diseases. With significant progress and achievements across our diverse and wholly-owned complement portfolio, we\u2019re more encouraged than ever by the opportunity for each of our potentially best-in-class flagship programs, and we remain laser focused on our mission to help scores of patients live their best lives,\u201d said Douglas Love, president and chief executive officer of Annexon.\u201d Mr. Love continued, \u201cSpecifically regarding the flagship programs, our ANX005 program is most advanced and positioned to displace current standard of care in GBS as the first potential targeted treatment to rapidly improve muscle strength and restore normal function in this devastating neurological condition, and we are preparing our BLA submission for the first half of 2025. Additionally, our ANX007 registrational Phase 3 ARCHER II trial in GA is designed to replicate the significant vision preservation observed in the ARCHER proof-of-concept trial, and enrollment is on pace for completion in the second half of 2025. Finally, ANX1502, our first-in-kind oral C1s inhibitor, is advancing toward clinical proof-of-concept data in the first quarter of 2025 with the potential to disrupt the landscape treating a range of autoimmune and other diseases currently managed with infused biologics. With significant catalysts approaching, we\u2019re excited to take advantage of our strong momentum and are well-positioned for a breakthrough year ahead.\u201d Story Continues 2025 Strategic Priorities and Key Catalysts ANX005 for GBS: Potential to be the first targeted therapy for GBS Successful pivotal Phase 3 trial showed ANX005 helped patients get better sooner with rapid improvement in muscle strength and more complete functional recovery than placebo through 6 months, and provided an important benefit in the burden of care by enabling patients to walk or be off ventilation earlier Real World Evidence (RWE) study matched ANX005-treated patients from the pivotal Phase 3 study with a Western world patient population predominantly from Europe and North America treated with current standards of care (intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) or plasma exchange (PE)). Consistent with Phase 3, ANX005 showed rapid increase in muscle strength with more complete recovery over IVIg or PE. Next Milestone: BLA Submission targeted for first half of 2025 ANX007 in GA: Only investigational therapy to show significant vision preservation on the endpoints of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and low light visual acuity (LLVA) in GA Successful Phase 2 ARCHER data showed significant protection of vision in both standard and low light conditions, as well as enhanced visual protection in patients with healthier eyes, and structural protection of photoreceptors in the central fovea that are associated with visual acuity Ongoing global registrational Phase 3 ARCHER II trial, a well-powered, sham-controlled study with a robust safety database, expected to enroll ~630 patients and use BCVA protection against \u226515-letter loss as primary outcome measure Next Milestone: Phase 3 ARCHER II trial enrollment to be completed in second half of 2025; data expected in second half of 2026 ANX1502 for Autoimmune Conditions: First-in-kind oral C1s inhibitor with convenient and flexible dosing Completed bridging study in healthy volunteers from a liquid suspension formulation to a twice-daily tablet with safety and pharmacokinetic profile similar or better than previous studies Ongoing open label single arm study in cold agglutinin disease (CAD) evaluating enteric-coated tablet formulation with improved tolerability will inform next steps for later-stage clinical development Next Milestone: Clinical proof of concept data in CAD and update on future target indications in first quarter of 2025 About Annexon Annexon Biosciences (Nasdaq: ANNX) is developing therapeutics that stop classical complement-driven neurodegeneration as first-in-kind treatments for millions of people living with serious neuroinflammatory diseases of the body, brain and eye. Our novel scientific approach focuses on C1q, the initiating molecule of classical complement\u2019s potent inflammatory pathway that when misdirected can lead to tissue damage and loss. By targeting C1q, our immunotherapies are designed to stop this neuroinflammatory cascade in disease before it starts. Our pipeline spans three diverse therapeutic areas \u2013 autoimmune, neurodegenerative and ophthalmic diseases \u2013 and includes targeted investigational drug candidates designed to address the unmet needs of over 8 million people worldwide. Annexon\u2019s mission is to deliver game-changing therapies to patients so that they can live their best lives. To learn more visit annexonbio.com.

Biosciences Real-World Evidence Study Strengthens the Body of Evidence Supporting ANX005 for Treatment of GBS ANX005 Phase 3 Population Was Matched 1:1 on Prespecified Criteria with Patients in International GBS Outcomes Study (IGOS) Matched Cohort Study Showed Early and Greater Benefits of ANX005 over IVIg or PE in Muscle Strength and Functional Outcomes Across Multiple Measurements Conference Call and Webcast Today at 8:30 a.m. ET BRISBANE, Calif., Dec. 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Annexon, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANNX), a biopharmaceutical company advancing a late-stage clinical platform of novel therapies for people living with devastating classical complement-mediated neuroinflammatory diseases of the body, brain, and eye, today announced positive topline results from a real-world evidence (RWE) study supporting ANX005 as a potential treatment for Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS). GBS is a rapid-onset and acute neuromuscular disease with no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments. ANX005, the most advanced targeted immunotherapy in development for GBS, is designed to rapidly block C1q and complement activity with a single dose to halt disease progression during the critical progressive phase of the disease. Working in collaboration, the IGOS investigators and Annexon established a cohort of 79 real-world patients from the IGOS global patient registry that was matched based on key prespecified prognostic factors to the cohort of 79 patients treated with ANX005 30 mg/kg from Annexon\u2019s completed Phase 3 study conducted outside the United States. Patients in the ANX005 Phase 3 population had moderate to severe disease, and the matching level demonstrates that the Phase 3 population is represented within the global GBS patient spectrum captured in IGOS. Patients treated with ANX005 showed faster and greater improvement in muscle strength and disability compared to patients in the matched IGOS cohort treated with IVIg or PE. The comparison also showed that fewer patients treated with ANX005 required mechanical ventilation. Further, ANX005-treated patients were observed to spend less time on ventilation and less time in the intensive care unit (ICU). These findings indicate that ANX005 may decrease the overall burden of GBS care. \u201cWe\u2019re highly encouraged by the growing body of evidence demonstrating consistent, robust effects of ANX005 treatment across the Phase 3 trial and in this real-world study of patients with GBS,\u201d said Douglas Love, president and chief executive officer of Annexon. \u201cWe look forward to discussing these data and our overall regulatory package with regulators as we prepare for our planned U.S. Biologics License Application submission in the first half of 2025.\u201d Story Continues Hugh Willison, MBBS, PhD, professor emeritus of neurology, University of Glasgow and a member of the IGOS Steering Committee added: \u201cIn this analysis, patients treated with a single dose of ANX005 showed improved and more rapid benefit on muscle strength and disability over matched patients treated with multiple days of IVIg or PE. Recognizing the common role of complement biology in GBS pathogenesis, it\u2019s reasonable to expect these results could translate well to a broad population of patients with GBS.\u201d Key findings comparing ANX005 30 mg/kg to IVIg or PE: By week 1, patients treated with ANX005 showed more than a 10-point improvement in muscle strength over patients treated with IVIg or PE, a clinically meaningful benefit as measured by Medical Research Council (MRC) sumscore and an indicator for future recovery potential 1 ( p < 0.0001) Patients treated with ANX005 were approximately twice as likely to be in a better state of health than patients on IVIg or PE on the GBS-Disability Scale (GBS-DS) at multiple timepoints throughout the study, including at week 8, the primary endpoint for the Phase 3 trial ( p = 0.0459) Approximately half the number of patients treated with ANX005 (n=15 of 79) required mechanical ventilation compared with patients treated with IVIg or PE (n=32 of 79) ( p = 0.022) ANX005-treated patients were observed to spend fewer days on mechanical ventilation and fewer days in the ICU (median of 12 fewer days for each measure, p = n.s.*) \u201cGBS is a traumatizing disease that can affect anyone, anywhere, at any time, resulting in nerve damage, severe weakness and acute paralysis,\u201d said Lisa Butler, executive director, GBS/CIDP Foundation International. \u201cThese new data from the ANX005 real-world study support the value of ANX005 as a potential novel targeted therapy for GBS. After decades with limited treatment options, none of which are FDA-approved, the GBS community deserves a future where patients can be hopeful for a quicker recovery and better outcomes.\u201d Conference Call and Webcast Information Annexon management will hold a conference call and webcast today at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss topline results from its real-world evidence (RWE) study in GBS.

About the Real-World Evidence Study Comparing ANX005 Treatment to IGOS Matched Cohort Working in collaboration, the IGOS investigators and Annexon conducted the RWE study. The RWE study applied a well-accepted statistical method of propensity score matching to establish 1:1 cohorts of patients matched on key prespecified prognostic factors of disease severity (muscle strength and GBS disability score measured at the time of hospitalization, prior to treatment). The same analytical and statistical approaches used to measure efficacy in the Phase 3 trial were applied to assess treatment effect in the matched populations (n=79 in each cohort). IGOS is a global, prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study that enrolled 2,000 patients who were followed for one to three years. Consistent with global standards of care (SoC), patients in the IGOS registry were treated with IVIg or PE. Published literature has demonstrated that more severe patients experience less benefit from IVIg or PE, further highlighting the unmet need in this patient population. 2, 3, 4, 5 About ANX005 Annexon\u2019s lead investigational therapy, ANX005, is a first-of-its kind selective, targeted and rapid-acting agent designed to reduce inflammation and nerve damage by stopping C1q activity in the peripheral and central nervous systems. In GBS, ANX005 is designed to seek out C1q and prevent its binding to targets on peripheral nerves. ANX005 is administered intravenously and has been observed to act almost immediately in blocking C1q function. The aim of an effective treatment in GBS is to rapidly stop the autoimmune damage on nerve cells, allowing patients to regain muscle strength sooner and to regain independence and return to pre-illness activities. ANX005 has received both Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as well as orphan drug designation from the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of GBS. About the ANX005 Phase 3 Trial Positive data from a previously reported Phase 3 study demonstrated statistically significant effects of 30mg/kg ANX005 treatment over placebo on multiple measures of GBS, including on the primary endpoint GBS-DS. Patients treated with ANX005 demonstrated a higher likelihood of being in a better state of health at week 1 on the GBS-DS, a benefit that was observed across the 26-week study period. Early, robust and durable treatment effects were observed, which resulted in expedited recovery and reduced days on mechanical ventilation, allowing patients to walk approximately one month earlier. ANX005 was generally well-tolerated with a safety profile similar to placebo. About Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) GBS is a severe disease resulting from an acute autoantibody and classical complement-mediated attack on peripheral nerves that generally occurs post-infection in otherwise healthy persons. It is an acute, rapidly progressive neurological disease with a narrow timeframe for therapeutic intervention. GBS results in the hospitalization of more than 22,000 people annually in the U.S. and Europe. The peripheral nerve damage progresses rapidly, causing acute neuromuscular paralysis that can lead to significant morbidity, disability and mortality. Currently, there are no approved treatments for GBS in the United States. The long-term disease burden associated with GBS has led to a multi-billion-dollar annual economic cost to the U.S. healthcare system alone. About Annexon Annexon Biosciences (Nasdaq: ANNX) is harnessing therapeutics against classical complement-driven neuroinflammation to advance potentially first-in-kind treatments for millions of people living with serious neuroinflammatory diseases of the body, brain and eye. Our novel scientific approach focuses on C1q, the initiating molecule of the classical complement cascade, which can inappropriately lead to severe tissue damage and loss. By targeting C1q, our immunotherapies are designed to stop neuroinflammatory diseases where they start. Our pipeline spans three diverse therapeutic areas \u2013 autoimmune, neurodegenerative and ophthalmic diseases \u2013 and includes targeted investigational drug candidates designed to address the unmet needs of over 8 million people worldwide.

In dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or geographic atrophy (GA), C1q binds to photoreceptor synapses, causing aberrant activation of the classical pathway with synapse loss, inflammation and neuronal damage that results in vision loss. Intravitreal administration of ANX007 fully stopped C1q and classical pathway activation. In animal models, the murine analog of ANX007 protected against loss of photoreceptor synapses and cells to preserve function. ANX007 has been granted Fast Track designation from the Food and Drug Administration and is the first therapeutic candidate for the treatment of GA to receive Priority Medicine (PRIME) designation in the EU, which provides early and proactive support to developers of promising medicines that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments or benefit to patients without treatment options. In the randomized, multi-center, double-masked, sham-controlled Phase 2 ARCHER clinical trial, ANX007 demonstrated consistent protection against vision loss across multiple measures in a broad population of patients with GA. ANX007 provided statistically significant, time and dose-dependent protection from vision loss as measured by \u2265 15 letter loss on reading an eye chart with best corrected visual acuity (BCVA\u226515), the widely accepted and clinically-meaningful functional endpoint. Significant protection from vision loss was also shown in other prespecified measures of BCVA and visual function, including low luminance visual acuity (LLVA) and low luminance visual deficit (LLVD). ANX007\u2019s treatment effect increased over the course of the on-treatment portion of the study, suggesting that ANX007 may provide a growing and durable treatment effect over time. While benefit gained against vision loss was maintained during the subsequent six-month off-treatment period, the rate of decline for BCVA \u2265 15-letter vision after treatment termination began to parallel that of sham, providing additional support for the observed on-treatment protection. ANX007 was also shown to protect key retinal structures important for vision, including significant protection of photoreceptors as measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and supported by slowing of loss of retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) near the fovea, as measured by fundus autofluorescence (FAF). ANX007 was generally well-tolerated through month 12, with no increase in choroidal neovascularization (CNV) rates between the treated and sham arms and no events of retinal vasculitis reported. About Dry AMD and Geographic Atrophy Dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common form of AMD and geographic atrophy (GA) is an advanced form of dry AMD, an eye disease that is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly. Dry AMD and GA are chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorders of the retina involving the loss of photoreceptor synapses and cells in the outer retina. GA affects an estimated one million people in the United States and eight million people globally, severely limiting their independence and causing frustration, anxiety and emotional hardship. Effective treatments that preserve vision are still needed, as no currently approved therapies have been shown in clinical trials to significantly prevent vision loss. About Phase 3 ARCHER II Trial ARCHER II is a global, randomized, double-masked, sham-controlled Phase 3 trial expected to enroll approximately 630 patients with geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration who will be randomized 2:1 to receive a monthly dose of ANX007 or sham procedure. The primary endpoint is the prevention of \u226515-letter loss of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), which represents three lines on the standard Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) eye chart. The primary analysis will occur between 12 and 18 months from dosing initiation based on the accumulation of target events (patients in the overall study experiencing BCVA \u226515-letter loss on consecutive visits). Proportion of patients experiencing BCVA \u226515-letter loss is a well-established functional endpoint that has served as the basis for numerous ophthalmology drug approvals by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA). Secondary endpoints in ARCHER II include safety, low-luminance visual acuity (LLVA), and photoreceptor integrity (EZ). Topline data are expected in the second half of 2026.

Potential ANX005 Commercialization Robust Balance Sheet with Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Short-term Investments of Approximately $340 Million as of September 30, 2024, and Anticipated Runway into Second Half 2026 BRISBANE, Calif., Nov. 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Annexon, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANNX), a biopharmaceutical company advancing a late-stage clinical platform of novel therapies for people living with devastating classical complement-mediated neuroinflammatory diseases of the body, brain, and eye, today highlighted portfolio progress and reported third quarter 2024 financial results. \u201cWe are executing toward a strong finish for the year to propel us into the start of an impactful 2025. The RWE data for our ANX005 GBS program expected by year end 2024 will be an important part of our first BLA submission as a company and a significant step toward providing GBS patients with a targeted and approved therapy. ARCHER II, our Phase 3 trial in GA, is actively enrolling and designed to provide the first significant data for protection of vision in a pivotal GA trial. Finally, we\u2019re anticipating data from our first-in-kind oral C1s program, ANX1502, with an improved tablet formulation in patients with CAD in the first quarter of 2025,\u201d said Douglas Love, president and chief executive officer of Annexon. Mr. Love continued, \u201cOur portfolio of programs has provided consistent support for our approach to target C1q, a key upstream driver of neuroinflammatory diseases of the body, brain and eye, and we\u2019re encouraged by the outlook for our programs. With a strong balance sheet and runway into the second half of 2026, we are laser-focused to deliver on our near-term goals and achieve our mission of helping millions of patients live their best lives.\u201d Recent Corporate and Clinical Program Updates Strengthened senior leadership team in commercial, medical affairs and health economics to advance global late-stage neuroinflammatory-targeted portfolio: Appointments include Shikhar Agarwal, M.B.A. as senior vice president, head of commercial, Sunil B. Mehta, Pharm.D as senior vice president of medical affairs and Myoung Kim, PhD, M.A., M.B.A. as vice president of health economics and outcomes research. Story Continues Flagship Programs ANX005 in Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS): First-in-kind monoclonal antibody designed to block C1q and the entire classical complement pathway in both the body and the brain has the potential to be the first targeted therapy for GBS, if approved. Positive topline Phase 3 data demonstrated statistically significant effects of ANX005 treatment on multiple measures of GBS, including on the primary endpoint GBS-disability scale (GBS-DS) Demonstrated higher likelihood of being in a better state of health as early as week 1, and observed through 26-weeks on the GBS-DS Early, robust and durable treatment effects expedited recovery and led to patients walking and off ventilation for those requiring it approximately one month earlier Single infusion of ANX005 was generally well-tolerated with a safety profile similar to placebo and balanced across groups Patients with baseline characteristics similar to those of patients in North America and Europe had greater responses to ANX005 over placebo than were observed in the overall population of the study Ongoing RWE study conducted by global experts in GBS using the International Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome Outcomes Study (IGOS) Study will produce a cohort of patients from our GBS Phase 3 trial matched to patients in the IGOS registry based on key prognostic factors to support BLA submission Study will compare outcomes of patients treated with ANX005 vs. patients treated with IVIg or plasma exchange assessed on the GBS-DS primary and other outcome measures, including impact on muscle strength ANX007 in Geographic Atrophy (GA): First-in-kind, non-pegylated antigen-binding fragment (Fab) designed to block C1q and the classical complement cascade locally in the eye is the only investigational medicine to date to show significant protection against \u226515-letter loss (vision protection) on the endpoint of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in GA. Ongoing global registrational Phase 3 ARCHER II trial, a well-powered, randomized, double masked, sham-controlled trial that will include a robust safety database expected to enroll approximately ~630 patients Regulatory alignment with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on the primary outcome measure for the Phase 3 program, BCVA protection against \u226515-letter loss New Phase 2 ARCHER data on the protection of vision and vision-related retinal structure presented at the 2024 American Society of Retina Specialists Annual Scientific meeting, at the Retina Society\u2019s 57 th annual scientific meeting, at the 24 th annual Euretina Congress, at the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) 2024 annual meeting and at the Eyecelerator conference at AAO. Highlighted data with ANX007 treatment included: Significant vision protection in both standard and low light conditions, and protection of photoreceptor integrity in the central fovea, the region of the retina most important for activities such as reading, driving and recognizing faces Enhanced protection of vision in healthier eyes and greater preservation of central photoreceptor cells in patients with less advanced GA, as measured by the photoreceptor ellipsoid zone (EZ) in the central fovea ANX1502 for Autoimmune Conditions: First-in-kind oral C1s inhibitor has the potential to offer the advantages of selective upstream classical complement inhibition with the convenience and flexibility of oral administration. Completed bridging study in healthy volunteers from a liquid suspension formulation to a twice daily tablet with safety and pharmacokinetic profile similar or better than previous studies Created an enteric-coated tablet formulation to enhance the patient experience and provide improved tolerability, for use in the proof-of-concept (POC) study in CAD Ongoing open label single arm study in CAD patients will evaluate enteric-coated tablet formulation of ANX1502 administered twice daily for up to 4 weeks. The study will characterize the pharmacodynamics of ANX1502 on objective and established markers of complement activation and disease-related hemolysis POC study is designed to enable advancement in multiple antibody-mediated autoimmune indications, including those with clinical validation and where approved treatments require weekly or every other week infusions Key Anticipated Milestones for Flagship Programs ANX005 in GBS: Initial topline data from RWE comparability protocol with IGOS expected by year-end 2024 to support a planned BLA submission in the first half of 2025 ANX007 in GA: Phase 3 ARCHER II trial topline data expected in the second half of 2026. Plans for an injection-controlled study, ARROW, to assess the prevention of \u226515-letter loss of BCVA, are being assessed ANX1502 in CAD: Initial data from POC trial evaluating the pharmacodynamics of an oral tablet formulation in CAD expected in the first quarter of 2025 Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results Cash and operating runway: Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $340.1 million as of September 30, 2024.

But late last summer, Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman Freddie Freeman had to step away from the game for several weeks when his son became ill with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a rare, potentially life-threatening neurological disorder. The swell of support for Freeman, who went on to become the 2024 World Series MVP, suddenly raised the profile of the disease. In GBS, the immune system mistakenly attacks part of the peripheral nervous system. Symptoms come on suddenly and progress rapidly, starting with tingling and weakness and sometimes leading to paralysis. \u201cIt starts in your feet and moves up through your body,\u201d said Douglas Love, president and CEO of Annexon Biosciences, which has a late-stage GBS candidate in the pipeline. \u201cOne in four patients are going to be on a ventilator within a couple of weeks.\u201d That common trajectory was the same for Freeman\u2019s three-year-old son, Maximus. Within a matter of days, he developed a limp, couldn\u2019t sit up and eventually couldn\u2019t breathe on his own. Although the \u201cwhy\u201d behind GBS is unknown, it strikes days or weeks after another illness, such as a respiratory or gastrointestinal bacterial or viral infection, has cleared. \u201cThere\u2019s no disease that I'm familiar with that\u2019s like Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. It happens in patients who are otherwise completely healthy,\u201d said Love. GBS impacts 3,000-6,000 people in the U.S. each year, according to the CDC , and is often treated with off-label intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. \u201cIt has some effect, depending upon how severe the disease is. But the more severe the disease, the less effective IVIG is,\u201d Love said. However, there\u2019s no FDA-approved treatment for the disease, and while most patients recover, the process can be long and brutal. \u201cIt's a neurological nightmare for patients that deserves an appropriate therapy.\" Douglas Love CEO, Annexon Biosciences Annexon Biosciences wants to change that. The company successfully completed a pivotal phase 3 trial for its lead candidate, ANX005, an immunotherapy that targets and blocks C1q, the molecule that initiates the classical complement pathway associated with GBS. ANX005 received FDA fast track and orphan drug designations. \u201cWe're pursuing what is a unique or diverse approach from other complement programs in that we're targeting upstream complement activity,\u201d Love said. \u201cIt localizes and activates complement or inflammation right on disease tissue, so you can be more proximal in your approach in targeting aberrant inflammation.\u201d Story Continues A June phase 3 readout showed ANX005 had statistically significant results on key endpoints, including on the GBS disability scale. Unlike IVIG, which is administered over five days, ANX005 is given by IV infusion within a few hours and works that quickly, too, Love said. \u201cOur drug is quite simple. It is designed to block C1q immediately upon administration,\u201d he said. \u201cIt speaks to the power of our approach, which is quickly shutting down C1q, shutting down the disease process, and allowing patients to move from a state of decline to stopping the disease process.\u201d Love said the company plans to file its biologics license application for ANX005 in the first half of 2025. Although the GBS market is small, Annexon will have it cornered as the first and only approved treatment if it wins an FDA OK. In addition, Love said there\u2019s a 90% compliance rate in treating GBS, and 80% of the disease\u2019s incidence occurs in five large states and in \u201cjust a few hundred hospitals.\u201d \u201cAlthough [GBS] happens acutely and sporadically, it happens where you have more people,\u201d he said. \u201cThat allows us to have a very efficient commercial footprint.\u201d ANX005 isn\u2019t the only product in Annexon\u2019s pipeline targeting C1q. Its other flagship programs are in geographic atrophy and complement-mediated autoimmune diseases, as well as programs in Huntington\u2019s disease, ALS and lupus nephritis. \u201cWe're the first, and thus far, the only company targeting C1q in the clinic,\u201d Love said. \u201cBy targeting C1q where it initiates this inflammatory disease process, it allows us to pursue a wide swath of indications that you don't necessarily always see with complement programs.\u201d First up, though, is a chance to change the trajectory of GBS. \u201cIt's a neurological nightmare for patients that deserves an appropriate therapy,\u201d Love said.
