[{"text": "Record Resources' Hydrogen Neighbour Delivers Outstanding Drilling Results Newsfile Corp. Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 5:55 PM 3 min read In This Article: REC.V 0.00% Calgary, Alberta--(Newsfile Corp. - January 23, 2025) - Record Resources Inc. (TSXV: REC) is strongly impressed and highly encouraged by the drilling results of its Lake Temiskaming neighbour, Quebec Innovate Materials Corporation (QIMC) (see QIMC news release, January 21, 2025). \"From what we've seen, these are some of the best grades of any early-stage hydrogen exploration project,\" said Michael Judson, Record Resources CEO. \"Other explorers have reported 500 and 700 ppm measurements. QIMC hit 7000 ppm. This is another level.\" \"QIMC also made history. They are the first exploration company to drill shallow wells targeting natural hydrogen,\" said Judson. \"Everyone else has been doing soil samples. This drilling provides us with much more compelling data and more confidence regarding the geological occurrence.\" One shallow well drilled by QIMC reached a measurement 7,119 parts per million, plateauing at 2,886 ppm. Five other measurements included one of over 2,400 ppm, one of over 1,000 ppm and one of over 900 ppm.\" The results were recorded with wells drilled to shallow depths of up to 50 metres. The drilling locations in new fault zones inferred from electrical tomography imagery performed by the Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique during fall 2024. \"This achievement, despite the challenging very cold winter conditions, underscores the robustness of our geological and geophysical models, validating our geophysical identification of potentially advective fault zones as key areas for abundant natural hydrogen,\" stated John Karagiannidis, chief executive officer of Quebec Innovative,\" said John Karagiannidis, QIMC CEO, in a January 21, 2025 news release. Record's newly acquired Lorrain-Bucke hydrogen property (see company's January 14, 2025 news release) is contiguous with the QIMC on its western boundary in Lake Temiskaming in Ontario. Record's Lorrain-Bucke claim blocks are strategically located between major rift faults in the Lake Temiskaming Graben structure and directly adjacent to QIMC's St-Bruno-de-Guigues hydrogen project. (See figure 1). Record also corrects the date of expiration reported for the finder's warrants referenced in the company's December 30, 2024 news release regarding the closing of the company's 436,999.95 Private Placement. The correct exercise period is 24 months following the closing of the Offering, as follows: the company paid finders' fees and issued finders' shares and finders' warrants to EMD Financial Inc. consisting of: (i) cash finders' fees of 8 per cent of the gross proceeds of the offering; (ii) finders' shares in an amount equal of 4 per cent of the number of units issued pursuant to the offering; and (iii) finders' warrants in an amount equal of 4 per cent of the number of units issued pursuant to the offering, exercisable at a price of five cents per common share for a period of 24 months following the closing of the offering.

Launch of Caregiver Leave Benefit, Strengthening Inclusive Family-Friendly Offerings Business Wire Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 5:05 PM 5 min read Caregiver Leave Benefit to offer financially protected 10-day minimum leave to employees globally Primarily aimed to support the care of critically and terminally ill immediate family members Program to be introduced starting in 2025 on a market-by-market basis DARMSTADT, Germany, January 22, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, a leading science and technology company, today announced the introduction of a Caregiver Leave Benefit as an additional family-friendly offering for employees of the company and its affiliates. The new global benefit includes a minimum of ten days of financially protected leave. 1 This initiative builds on the recent rollout of the global Fertility Benefit at Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany and its affiliates, and advances the company\u2019s journey to provide an inclusive suite of benefits that support employees\u2019 holistic well-being. \"At our company, we recognize the vital role that caregivers play and understand what is required of those who take this on, alongside the day-to-day care of their families and work responsibilities. We can\u2019t always anticipate when a loved one needs extraordinary care. Any of us could find ourselves in such a situation at a moment's notice, and we want to take at least one worry off our employees by giving them the opportunity to focus on their family during this challenging time. Our employees who become caregivers live our values, exhibiting courage, respect, and a strong sense of duty. It is critical, and part of our commitment as an employer, to ensure that employees are supported, together, with the loved ones they care for,\" said Bel\u00e9n Garijo, Chair of the Executive Board and CEO of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. \"Our new Caregiver Leave Benefit is one more example of how we, at Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany and its affiliates, look holistically at our benefits offering to ensure the health and well-being of our employees no matter what stage they are in life,\" said Khadija Ben Hammada, Chief Human Resources Officer at Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. \"I am proud that we are further expanding our range of benefits. This way, we can give employees more time, space, and financial support for moments that matter.\" The Caregiver Leave Benefit is intended for use by those caring for immediate family members who are critically or terminally ill. This includes but is not limited to parents, children, and partners. The new benefit is expected to be rolled out globally over the next twelve months on a market-by-market basis, designed locally to include and integrate with any existing leave benefits or regulatory requirements that support employees in their individual situation. Story Continues Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, has a longstanding commitment to supporting caregivers and a close connection to this community through its Healthcare business. The 2017 launch of \" Embracing Carers \u00ae \" for caregivers around the world opened an avenue to enhance support and resources, including training and upskilling to benefit caregivers and their loved ones.
