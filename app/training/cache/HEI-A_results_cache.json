Ashar Jawad Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 7:01 PM 6 min read In This Article: HEI-A +0.70% We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Space Stocks To Buy According To Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where HEICO Corporation (NYSE:HEI) stands against the other space stocks. We also dive deep into American dominance in space technology. Space exploration continues to be a key area of research for scientists. In recent decades, it has attracted interest from security experts globally, given the wide use of satellites for peaceful military purposes, such as navigation, intelligence gathering, and military communications. READ ALSO: 8 Best Military Drone Stocks To Buy According to Analysts and 11 Undervalued Aerospace Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds . Both the United States and the Soviet Union had come close during the Cold War to developing satellites that were capable of striking targets on the surface of Earth. However, all efforts were put to a halt with the 1967 Outer Space Treaty that bans countries from non-peaceful activities in space, including stationing weapons of mass destruction. The United States continues to dominate space, with the most number of active satellites and the largest space budget. Home-based aerospace companies have played a key role in ensuring this strength. Space Based-Infrared System, or SBIRS, which is one of the United States Space Force\u2019s high priority programs, has further enhanced the country\u2019s space power with capabilities to detect missile launches and provide early warning. Several pure-play space stocks have surged following Trump\u2019s victory in the November 2024 presidential elections, driven by what analysts are describing as the \u2018Trump-Elon trade\u2019. While talking to CNBC, Andrew Chanin, the CEO of ProcureAM, LLC, which runs an ETF with exposure to space stocks, believes the Trump-Elon partnership will prove to be a significant driving force for the industry. \"I don\u2019t think anyone can underplay the potential catalyst that I don\u2019t think many people were talking about before: the most important human in the history of the space industry having the ear of the president-elect, who in his past term found space important enough to create a separate branch of the military.\" Strong financial results during the third quarter of 2024 have also partly led the stock rally. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst, Andres Sheppard, has said there is a broader sentiment driving the stocks, such as demand for national security and ongoing work on key space projects. \"We\u2019re seeing a big increase in investor inbounds. We\u2019re getting calls and emails from institutional investors, which are finally starting to realize that this market is only going to continue to accelerate. It\u2019s only going to continue to proliferate because of national security, because of the Artemis program to get the U.S. astronauts back on the moon, because of Elon\u2019s ambitious goals of getting to Mars.\" Story Continues Sheppard also stated that space stocks are benefitting from SpaceX being privately held, as investors look toward other companies in the industry to enhance their exposure to the space sector.

+1.12% HEI-A +0.70% META +0.55% Investors brace for a bumpy ride as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s second term gets underway on Monday, bringing the promise of significant policy shifts \u2014 including lighter regulation and tax cuts. Those two priorities have Wall Street upbeat, while cooling inflation and strong earnings have also fueled investor optimism. This past week, the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) clocked its best weekly performance since the election. Since Nov. 5, the S&P 500 has climbed 3.6%. Yet some areas of the market could be at risk, as Trump\u2019s unpredictable approach is largely expected to trigger market volatility. In recent weeks, I\u2019ve spoken with several top CEOs and Wall Street analysts about what Trump 2.0 means for businesses and investors. Here\u2019s what they told me about the incoming administration\u2019s expected impact across various sectors. Winning trades under Trump: Financials, industrials, airlines, crypto Financials Financials is viewed as a top trade as investors bet on looser regulation and increased M&A activity. Just this week, the nation\u2019s largest banks reported a surge in corporate profits . \"There has been a meaningful shift in CEO confidence, particularly following the results of the US election,\" Goldman Sachs ( GS ) CEO David Solomon said on the bank\u2019s earnings call. \u201cIt feels like we have a tailwind going into 2025.\" Meanwhile, JPMorgan ( JPM ) CFO Jeremy Barnum cited a \u201csignificant amount of increase of optimism in the overall environment,\u201d telling reporters following the bank\u2019s earnings results that \u201cwe\u2019re in an animal-spirits moment right now.\u201d \u201cWe need to have a more level, less volatile regulatory environment,\u201d Chris Whalen, chairman of Whalen Global Advisors, told me on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Morning Brief. \u201cHaving banks manage their business on whether or not [Senator] Elizabeth Warren is going to attack them or not is absurd. You can't run a business that way.\u201d Read more: Trump lurks over Davos and the World Economic Forum Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Mac Sykes expects lighter oversight of the banking industry to be a catalyst for the group, telling Yahoo Finance that deregulation will \u201cbenefit the banks.\u201d \u201cThere was a 10% hit that was coming [from Basel III endgame], and that probably will go to neutral,\u201d Sykes said . He also added that increased M&A within the sector will allow smaller players to take advantage of synergies, an outcome that\u2019s being \u201cunderappreciated by investors.\u201d Industrials Goldman Sachs analyst Joe Ritchie told me last month that the industrial sector is gaining confidence after months of contraction, adding \u201cseveral companies are expecting better growth in 2025 \u2026 It\u2019s only a matter of time before it happens.\u201d Story Continues \u2022 USD (XLI) Follow View Quote Details HEICO ( HEI ) co-president Eric Mendelson is among the group\u2019s business leaders who see Trump\u2019s policies boosting investor confidence in the economy, creating a \u201cvery positive environment\u201d for the industrial sector. And Elon Musk\u2019s influence on the incoming administration could be another catalyst. Robert Cardillo, chief strategist of Planet Labs ( PL ), told me last month at the Goldman Sachs Industrial and Materials conference that Musk\u2019s impact will likely be \u201cgood news\u201d for the sector. Airlines Industry leaders and experts are expecting the incoming administration to create a supportive backdrop for the sector. \u201cIt\u2019s constructive in a lot of ways \u2026 The tax efforts I think are constructive. The regulatory environment I hope is also more constructive for the industry,\u201d Southwest ( LUV ) CEO Bob Jordan told me last month . And industry watchers are predicting significant changes to the air transportation and aerospace sector, including plans to scale back the Biden administration's consumer protection initiatives and reduce regulations affecting the commercial space and advanced air mobility industries, according to recent analysis from Pillsbury law firm\u2019s aviation team. \u201cWe anticipate seeing support from the Trump Administration for joint-ventures, mergers and/or acquisition efforts by smaller airlines to compete more effectively with the larger U.S. airlines,\u201d Pillsbury\u2019s Charles Donley, Edward Sauer, and Laura Jennings Ochoa wrote. That sentiment is being echoed by top industry analysts. \u201cBetween the new administration\u2019s stance as well as some of the smaller airlines struggling, there's a better chance of M&A now \u2026 that's an upside for the group and definitely a higher likelihood in 2025 than what we've seen these past few years,\u201d Raymond James\u2019s Savanthi Syth told me . \u2022 USD (LUV) Follow View Quote Details Tech Big Tech leaders are cozying up to President-elect Donald Trump due to his plans to peel back regulations and invest heavily in AI . Amazon ( AMZN ) founder Jeff Bezos, Apple ( AAPL ) CEO Tim Cook, Alphabet ( GOOGL ) CEO Sundar Pichai, Meta ( META ) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Microsoft ( MSFT ) CEO Satya Nadella are among tech leaders who contributed funds to Trump\u2019s inauguration campaign as Big Tech tries to win the backing of the new administration. \u2022 USD (META) Follow View Quote Details Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives expects the technology sector to be a big winner this year, predicting a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d scenario for Big Tech. \u201cWe expect tech stocks to be up 25% in 2025 as the Street further digests a less regulatory spider web under Trump in the White House with Khan/FTC days in the rear-view mirror, stronger AI initiatives within the Beltway on the way, and a goldilocks foundation for Big Tech and Tesla looking into 2025 and beyond,\u201d Ives wrote in a note to clients. IBM ( IBM ) CEO Arvind Krishna told me at Yahoo Finance\u2019s Invest conference that he\u2019s hopeful the incoming Trump administration will foster \u201ca lot more innovation and less regulation,\u201d laying the groundwork for a more favorable deal environment. \u201cIf we have more certainty on the outcome, then we are willing to lean into things like M&A. \u2026 If the regulatory process and antitrust are going to be more certain, that allows you to take more risk,\u201d Krishna said. Losing trades under Trump: Automakers, retailers, construction Automakers Plans by the incoming administration to roll back the Biden administration\u2019s EV policies on day one, along with threats of tariffs, pose a risk to the automotive sector. Tom Donnelly, president and CEO of Mazda North American Operations, told me it\u2019s \u201cpotentially\u201d more difficult to do business under Trump given the unpredictability surrounding his administration and the potential for more tariffs. He told Yahoo Finance that Mazda has been \u201cscenario planning\u201d for months, which includes potentially shifting some of its production from Mexico to its plant in Alabama. \u201cUncertainty isn\u2019t beneficial,\u201d Donnelly told me. \u201cWhat's clear is no business in any industry can absorb the magnitude of what's being talked about here.\u201d Since Election Day, Trump has threatened a slew of tariffs, ranging from a gradual implementation to a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 60% tariff on Chinese goods. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico, in particular, are expected to be an overhang for the auto sector this year. Evercore\u2019s Chris McNally remains \u201crelatively cautious\u201d on the entire legacy auto group until there\u2019s a resolution on Trump\u2019s tariff threats, warning of an earnings hit to some of the industry\u2019s largest players. \u201cGeneral Motors ( GM ) has the highest negative EPS exposure to a 25% Mexico Tariff in the whopping range of 45%-50% EPS hit if implemented,\u201d McNally wrote in a note to clients earlier this month. GM CEO Mary Barra told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi tariffs could mean higher car prices, and maybe more sluggish demand. RBC\u2019s Tom Narayan sees Trump\u2019s \u201cerratic\u201d behavior as a risk to the industry and expects Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs to \u201ccontinue to pressure\u201d auto stocks until the industry gains some clarity. \u2022 USD (GM) Follow View Quote Details Discount retailers Discount retailers are among the stocks most at risk of tariffs , as the group relies heavily on Chinese imports. For example, nearly a third of products sold at Boot Barn ( BOOT ) are produced in China, while 25% are produced in Mexico, according to recent analysis from Bank of America\u2019s Christopher Nardone. Dollar Tree ( DLTR ) CEO Michael Creedon noted on the company\u2019s third quarter earnings call that the retailer has policies in place to mitigate risk associated with tariffs, including the ability to \u201celiminate the product altogether.\u201d Construction Trump\u2019s promise of mass deportations, along with tariffs, is a risk to the construction industry. \u201cHigher tariffs on Canada and Mexico and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants could increase costs for materials and labor. Higher tariffs on China could slow its economy, causing land developers to slow their investments,\u201d S&P Global Ratings wrote in a recent note. The team notes that softwood lumber, which is used to frame buildings, is often imported from Canada, while drywall and cement component gypsum is often imported from both Mexico and Canada. And that sentiment was echoed by Realtor.com\u2019s senior economist Joel Berner, who warned that higher costs will slow building activity. \u201cPolicy initiatives of the incoming Trump administration, which has promised tariffs on imported goods that include construction materials and mass deportations that will impact builders\u2019 labor forces, surely have come into play as builders slow down in terms of initiating new building projects,\u201d Berner wrote.

Its Flight Support Group (FSG) provides FAA-approved aircraft and engine replacement parts, while the Electronics Technologies Group (ETG) serves industries such as aerospace, defense, homeland security, space, and medical with specialized electronic components. We believe the company is well-positioned to benefit from the steady aging of the global commercial aerospace fleet, resulting in increased consumption of aftermarket parts. Additionally, ongoing production issues from two major aircraft manufacturers have reduced the projected new plane deliveries, further supporting our view that the average age of the global fleet is likely to remain elevated over the next few years. During the quarter, shares detracted from performance after the company reported mixed fiscal fourth-quarter results. While earnings met analyst estimates, revenues fell short of consensus, accompanied by a modest revenue slowdown in commercial aerospace aftermarket revenue, which was largely expected. Despite this, we believe the company remains well-positioned for long-term growth potential within the commercial aerospace aftermarket.\" A machinist performing intricate work on a high-temperature resistant alloy for a jet engine.

They\u2019re also rising here and in some foreign countries due to concerns over growing government debt and deficit burdens. Markets will get key inflation readings this week, including the Producer Price Index (PPI) on Tuesday and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday. Those could cause significant market volatility (one way, the other, or both!) depending on how hot or cold they turn out to be. The next Fed meeting is set for Jan. 28-29 and rate futures markets are all but pricing out a Fed rate cut. A month ago, they were pricing in about an 18% chance of another 25-basis point reduction. The dollar is rallying in response to expectations US rates will remain higher than foreign rates for longer. That, in turn, is helping tighten financial conditions here.

2025, 1:00 PM 2 min read As technologies go, AI is a game-changer. Maybe the game-changer of game-changers. As Time detailed in its February story \u201cThe First AI War,\u201d there\u2019s one public company \u2013 an American company \u2013 that\u2019s staked itself to an early lead. That company is Palantir Technologies Inc. ( PLTR ) , observes Bill Patalon , chief stock picker at Stock Picker\u2019s Corner . Editor\u2019s Note: To get a FREE copy of the complete MoneyShow 2025 Top Picks Report , click HERE .) Before I came into the investing-research business in 2005, I spent 22 years as an award-winning business journalist. A swath of it was spent covering the same defense sector that employed my dad, a great man who had a five-decade professional career as an engineer. It all taught me the importance of history \u2013 especially military history \u2013 because I learned that you can\u2019t understand what\u2019s coming\u2026if you don\u2019t understand what\u2019s been. Like the \u201cfirst\u201d Cold War \u2013 and the New Cold War. Like the generations of globalization now shifted into reverse as \u201cdeglobalization.\u201d And how new defense technologies can provide that critical \u201cedge\u201d on the shooting battlefield\u2026and on that \u201cother\u201d battlefield we know as the global economy. Palantir was seeded in part by an investment from the CIA\u2019s venture-capital arm. It built its business providing data-analytics software to government agencies dealing with immigration, law enforcement, the military, and more. In laymen\u2019s terms (and I\u2019m intentionally oversimplifying this), Palantir\u2019s \u201csuperpower\u201d on the defense side of its business is how its AI tech can take streams of data from an array of sources \u2013 I\u2019m talking troops on the ground, armored vehicles, aircraft, satellites, and drones \u2013 and weave that into a rolling, real-time view of the battlefield that commanders can use for instantaneous decision-making. On the battlefields of old \u2013 on land, sea, or in air \u2013 the game mostly came down to numbers superiority. With AI, that game becomes one of \u201cdecision superiority.\u201d Nations know this, which is why AI is fueling the New Arms Race. Here in the United States alone, AI-defense spending is spooling up \u2013 fast. Pentagon AI contract awards zoomed from $355 million for the 12 months that ended in August 2022 to $4.6 billion a year later, a Brookings Institution study found. The military/government business is what drew me in, but it\u2019s only half of the story. The company\u2019s commercial segment \u2013 the other 45% \u2013 is a bonus: It\u2019s surging with success stories. Story Continues See also: Top Picks 2025: Super Micro Computer (SMCI) Tyson Foods Inc. ( TSN ) used Palantir\u2019s know-how to improve its trucking operations. United Airlines Holdings Inc. ( UAL ) linked up in a \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d to better manage its data. Palantir has also found commercial fans at other companies. The best way to go here is the \u201cAccumulate Strategy.\u201d Establish a foundational position in Palantir. Add to your stake on pullbacks. And look to hold this stock for three to five years.

2 min read Hollywood, Fla.-based Heico Corp. ( HEI ) is the world\u2019s largest independent producer of replacement aircraft parts. It is also a major supplier of niche subcomponents used in targeting and simulation by government and commercial aerospace and defense markets, writes John Dobosz , editor of Forbes Dividend Investor . Editor\u2019s Note: To get a FREE copy of the complete MoneyShow 2025 Top Picks Report , click HERE .) Founded in 1957 as Heinicke Instruments, a manufacturer of medical laboratory equipment, the company branched into the aviation market with its acquisition of engine parts manufacturer Jet Avion in 1974. Over the past 50 years, Heico made more than 120 additional acquisitions \u2014 including three in a recent two-month span \u2014 to achieve wide-ranging exposure to industries including aviation, defense, space, medical, telecommunications, and electronics. Two-thirds of Heico\u2019s $2.9 billion in revenue last year was generated in the United States, and its major customers include Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT ), Northrop Grumman Corp. ( NOC ), Arrow Electronics Inc. ( ARW ), Boeing Co. ( BA ), Airbus. and the US government. Reflecting the impact of both acquisitions and organic growth, revenue this year is expected to grow 31% to $3.88 billion, with earnings up 25% to $3.65 per share. Heico\u2019s net sales increased 40% to $2.84 billion over the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Operating income rose 39% to $605.8 million. Strength in commercial aerospace has driven the flight support group to 16 consecutive quarters of sequential net sales growth. There is no doubt that Heico is a growth stock. Earnings are forecast to grow 17% in 2025, and analysts expect long-term earnings growth of 16.5% annually. The stock trades at 59 times trailing earnings, a price multiple that does not suggest cheapness for value investors. But this is not far above its average P/E over the past five years of 51 times earnings. Big money investors seem to be bullish on Heico. Florida billionaire optometrist and inventor Herbert A. Wertheim, whom we profiled before in Forbes Billionaire Investor , owns 7.5% of the outstanding shares, currently worth more than $1 billion. Ken Fisher\u2019s Fisher Asset Management reported adding 34,000 shares in the second quarter for a total position of 315,000 shares as of June 28.

editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Fri, Jan 3, 2025, 2:05 PM 3 min read In This Article: HEI +1.12% HEI-A +0.70% Let's talk about the popular HEICO Corporation ( NYSE:HEI ). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$279 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$237. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether HEICO's current trading price of US$237 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at HEICO\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for HEICO What's The Opportunity In HEICO? The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It\u2019s trading around 12% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy HEICO today, you\u2019d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company\u2019s true value is $270.48, then there isn\u2019t much room for the share price grow beyond what it\u2019s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because HEICO\u2019s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company\u2019s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity. What does the future of HEICO look like? NYSE:HEI Earnings and Revenue Growth January 3rd 2025 Future outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. HEICO's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 48%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value. What This Means For You Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in HEI\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value? Are you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on HEI, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop. Story Continues With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

Materials (ETR:HEI) shareholders have earned a 29% CAGR over the last three years editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Fri, Jan 3, 2025, 11:04 AM 3 min read In This Article: HDLMY -1.42% HLBZF 0.00% By buying an index fund, you can roughly match the market return with ease. But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. For example, Heidelberg Materials AG ( ETR:HEI ) shareholders have seen the share price rise 92% over three years, well in excess of the market decline (17%, not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 55% in the last year, including dividends. Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. See our latest analysis for Heidelberg Materials In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time. Heidelberg Materials was able to grow its EPS at 4.6% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. In comparison, the 24% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. This indicates that the market is feeling more optimistic on the stock, after the last few years of progress. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress. You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). XTRA:HEI Earnings Per Share Growth January 3rd 2025 Dive deeper into Heidelberg Materials' key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Heidelberg Materials's earnings, revenue and cash flow . What About Dividends? As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Heidelberg Materials' TSR for the last 3 years was 116%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence! A Different Perspective It's good to see that Heidelberg Materials has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 55% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 17% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

Mendelson, HEICO's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, along with Eric A. Mendelson and Victor H. Mendelson, HEICO's Co-Presidents, remarked, \"HEICO's continuing success warrants this 93rd consecutive semiannual cash dividend and we remain enthusiastic about the Company's growth ahead. As always, our Team Members receive this dividend in their HEICO 401K plan accounts, which is entirely appropriate given how our Team Members are responsible for HEICO's success.\" HEICO's Board of Directors also set the Company's next annual meeting of shareholders for March 14, 2025. Shareholders of record on January 17, 2025 are eligible to vote on matters to be considered at the meeting.

Factors that could cause such differences include, among others: the severity, magnitude and duration of public health threats, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; our liquidity and the amount and timing of cash generation; lower commercial air travel, airline fleet changes or airline purchasing decisions, which could cause lower demand for our goods and services; product specification costs and requirements, which could cause an increase to our costs to complete contracts; governmental and regulatory demands, export policies and restrictions, reductions in defense, space or homeland security spending by U.S. and/or foreign customers or competition from existing and new competitors, which could reduce our sales; our ability to introduce new products and services at profitable pricing levels, which could reduce our sales or sales growth; product development or manufacturing difficulties, which could increase our product development and manufacturing costs and delay sales; cybersecurity events or other disruptions of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business; and our ability to make acquisitions, including obtaining any applicable domestic and/or foreign governmental approvals, and achieve operating synergies from acquired businesses; customer credit risk; interest, foreign currency exchange and income tax rates; and economic conditions, including the effects of inflation, within and outside of the aviation, defense, space, medical, telecommunications and electronics industries, which could negatively impact our costs and revenues.

Alexandr Oleinic Sat, Dec 28, 2024, 10:55 PM 5 min read In This Article: HEI-A +0.70% BRK-B +0.26% We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 New Stock Picks . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Heico Corporation (NYSE:HEI) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s new stock picks. Warren Buffett is one of the few investors that do not require an introduction as his success, wealth and philanthropy are widely known and admired. Earlier this year, Buffett made it clear that his fortune, estimated at around $140 billion will go into a charitable trust that will be administered by his three children. Moreover, the trust will only be able to disburse funds upon unanimous agreement from all three children. In a recently-released letter to shareholders, Buffett explained: \u201cThat restriction enables an immediate and final reply to grant-seekers: \u201cIt\u2019s not something that would ever receive my brother\u2019s consent.\u201d And that answer will improve the lives of my children.\u201d However, in the meantime, Buffett still appears to be at the helm and running the operations at Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRK.A ) , even though he has handed over most of the day-to-day managing duties to his lieutenants. In the latest financial report, it was revealed that Berkshire has amassed a huge position in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in US Treasuries. The cash pile, which stands at $277 billion, is the largest that the holding company has ever had. Moreover, Berkshire has slowed down its stock buybacks and hasn\u2019t bought any of its own shares in the third quarter.

In this way, gathering cash will allow Berkshire to purchase shares at cheaper prices. Another explanation might come from Buffett\u2019s comments made at the annual meeting of Berkshire shareholders, where he said that he expected that capital gain taxes to go up, so realizing profits now might be way to save money later. Nevertheless, Berkshire still maintains a portfolio of 40 stocks. Many of the companies that the fund owns are long-term holdings and you can take a look at some of them in our analysis of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 longest-held stocks .

Corporation Reports Record Net Income (Up 35%), Operating Income (Up 15%) and Net Sales (Up 8%) for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2024 HEICO Wed, Dec 18, 2024, 12:25 AM 22 min read In This Article: HEI +1.12% HEI-A +0.70% HOLLYWOOD, FL and MIAMI, FL / ACCESSWIRE / December 17, 2024 / HEICO CORPORATION (NYSE:HEI.A)(NYSE:HEI) today reported net income increased 35% to a record $139.7 million, or $.99 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, up from $103.4 million, or $.74 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Net income increased 27% to a record $514.1 million, or $3.67 per diluted share, in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2024, up from $403.6 million, or $2.91 per diluted share, in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023. Net sales increased 8% to a record $1,013.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, up from $936.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.

The Company's consolidated operating margin improved to 21.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, up from 20.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Net sales increased 30% to a record $3,857.7 million in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2024, up from $2,968.1 million in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023. Operating income increased 32% to a record $824.5 million in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2024, up from $625.3 million in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023. The Company's consolidated operating margin improved to 21.4% in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2024, up from 21.1% in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023. Our commercial aerospace sales growth has resulted in seventeen consecutive quarters of sequential growth in net sales at the Flight Support Group. The Company incurred acquisition costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 related to the Wencor Group (\"Wencor\") acquisition, which decreased net income attributable to HEICO by approximately $13.6 million, or $.10 per diluted share. EBITDA increased 13% to $264.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, up from $234.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. EBITDA increased 32% to $1,002.2 million in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2024, up from $758.3 million in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023. See our reconciliation of net income attributable to HEICO to EBITDA at the end of this press release. Consolidated Results Laurans A. Mendelson, HEICO's Chairman and CEO, commented on the Company's fourth quarter results stating, \"We are proud to announce record consolidated net sales and operating income for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year of fiscal 2024, principally driven by exceptional operating performance at the Flight Support Group and notable contributions from our fiscal 2023 and 2024 acquisitions. Furthermore, these results reflect improved demand across all of the Flight Support Group's product lines resulting in strong 12% organic net sales growth for that operating segment. Story Continues Our total debt to net income attributable to HEICO ratio was 4.34x as of October 31, 2024, down from 6.14x as of October 31, 2023. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.06x as of October 31, 2024, down from 3.04x as of October 31, 2023. See our reconciliation of total debt to net debt at the end of this press release. Cash flow provided by operating activities increased 39% to $205.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, up from $148.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Cash flow provided by operating activities increased 50% to $672.4 million in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2024, up from $448.7 million in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023. Over the past few months, our Electronic Technologies Group made several strategic acquisitions, acquiring 70% of SVM Private Limited in November 2024, 87.9% of Mid Continent Controls, Inc. in October 2024, and 92.5% of Marway Power Solutions, Inc. in September 2024. Additionally, in August 2024, our Flight Support Group acquired the Aerial Delivery and Descent Devices divisions of Capewell Aerial Systems (\"Capewell\"). These acquisitions were funded using cash provided by operating activities, except for Capewell, which was principally funded using proceeds from our revolving credit facility. We expect each of these acquisitions to be accretive to our earnings within the year following the acquisition. Today, HEICO's Board of Directors declared a semiannual cash dividend of $.11 per share payable in January 2025. This cash dividend will be HEICO's 93 rd consecutive semiannual cash dividend since 1979. The cash dividend confirms our Board of Director's confidence in HEICO's future while continuing to reward our shareholders and retaining sufficient capital to fund our internal growth and acquisitions. As we look ahead to fiscal 2025, we anticipate net sales growth in both the Flight Support Group and Electronic Technologies Group, driven primarily by organic growth supported by strong demand for the majority of our products. Additionally, we plan to drive growth through our recently completed acquisitions while positioning ourselves to capitalize on potential opportunities from future acquisitions. Our priorities include advancing the development of new products and services, further expanding market penetration, and maintaining our financial strength and flexibility, all with a strong emphasis on delivering long-term value to our shareholders.\" Flight Support Group Eric A. Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, commented on the Flight Support Group's record setting fourth quarter results stating, \"Continuing on our growth momentum, we achieved record results in both net sales and operating income, with quarterly increases of 15% in net sales and 35% in operating income compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. These outstanding results were driven by robust 12% organic net sales growth, primarily fueled by a 13% organic increase in our aftermarket replacement parts product line, along with contributions from acquisitions completed in fiscal 2023 and 2024. This represents the seventeenth consecutive quarter of net sales growth for the Flight Support Group. The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 15% to a record $691.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, up from $601.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 49% to a record $2,639.4 million in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2024, up from $1,770.2 million in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023. The Flight Support Group's net sales increase in the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended October 31, 2024 reflects the impact from our fiscal 2023 and 2024 acquisitions and strong organic growth of 12% and 13%, respectively. The organic net sales growth mainly reflects increased demand across all of our product lines. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 35% to a record $154.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, up from $114.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The operating income increase principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth, decreased acquisition costs and an improved gross profit margin. The improved gross profit margin principally reflects the previously mentioned higher net sales within our aftermarket replacement parts and repair and overhaul parts and services product lines. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 53% to a record $593.1 million in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2024, up from $387.3 million in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023. The operating income increase principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth, decreased acquisition costs and an improved gross profit margin, partially offset by increased intangible asset amortization expense, increased performance-based compensation expense and the prior year impact from the amendment and termination of a contingent consideration agreement. The improved gross profit margin principally reflects the previously mentioned higher net sales within our aftermarket replacement parts and repair and overhaul parts and services product lines. The Flight Support Group's operating margin improved to 22.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, up from 19.0% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The increased operating margin principally reflects the previously mentioned lower acquisition costs and improved gross profit margin, as well as higher selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") efficiencies resulting from the previously mentioned net sales growth. The Flight Support Group's operating margin improved to 22.5% in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2024, up from 21.9% in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023. The increased operating margin principally reflects the previously mentioned lower acquisition costs and improved gross profit margin, as well as lower performance-based compensation expense as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by the previously mentioned higher intangible asset amortization expense and amendment and termination of a contingent consideration agreement.\" Electronic Technologies Group Victor H. Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, commented on the Electronic Technologies Group's fourth quarter results stating, \"Our quarterly results mainly featured high single-digit organic net sales growth of our space products, offset by lower defense products net sales, which are often lumpy, and slightly lower net sales of our other electronics products. We remain highly optimistic about more sustained growth across the majority of our product lines in fiscal 2025, driven by significantly higher orders and an increased quarter-end record backlog as of October 31, 2024. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales were $336.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, as compared to $342.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The net sales decrease principally reflects lower defense and other electronics net sales, partially offset by increased space products net sales and the impact from our fiscal 2024 acquisitions. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 3% to a record $1,263.6 million in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2024, up from $1,225.2 million in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023. The net sales increase is mainly attributable to the impact of our fiscal 2023 and 2024 acquisitions and increased organic net sales of our defense and aerospace products, partially offset by lower organic net sales of our other electronics and medical products. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income was $81.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, as compared to $86.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The operating income decrease principally reflects a less favorable gross profit margin mainly from the previously mentioned decreased defense and other electronics net sales, partially offset by the previously mentioned increased space products net sales. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 1% to a record $288.2 million in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2024, up from $285.1 million in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023. The operating income increase principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth and an improved gross profit margin, partially offset by lower SG&A efficiencies. The improved gross profit margin principally reflects the previously mentioned increased defense and aerospace products net sales, partially offset by the previously mentioned decreased other electronics and medical products net sales. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 24.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, as compared to 25.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The operating margin change principally reflects the previously mentioned less favorable gross profit margin and lower SG&A efficiencies. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 22.8% in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2024, as compared to 23.3% in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023. The operating margin change principally reflects increased SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales mainly from the previously mentioned lower SG&A efficiencies, which was partially offset by the previously mentioned improved gross profit margin.\" Non-GAAP Financial Measures To provide additional information about the Company's results, HEICO has discussed in this press release its EBITDA (calculated as net income attributable to HEICO adjusted for depreciation and amortization expense, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, interest expense and income tax expense), its net debt (calculated as total debt less cash and cash equivalents), and its net debt to EBITDA ratio (calculated as net debt divided by EBITDA), which are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). These non-GAAP measures are included to supplement the Company's financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and because the Company uses such measures to monitor and evaluate the performance of its business and believes the presentation of these measures enhance an investor's ability to analyze trends in the Company's business and to evaluate the Company's performance relative to other companies in its industry. However, these non-GAAP measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's financial results as reported under GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. These measures should only be used to evaluate the Company's results of operations in conjunction with their corresponding GAAP measures. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures in the last table included in this press release.

on Make Money, Make Time\u2019s Substack by Oliver | MMMT Wealth. In this article, we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on HEI. HEICO Corporation (NYSE:HEI)'s share was trading at $240.05 as of Dec 24 th . HEI\u2019s trailing and forward P/E were 65.41 and 56.50 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. 10 Most Dangerous Jobs in the World Dmitry Birin/Shutterstock.com Heico (NYSE:HEI) specializes in designing, producing, and repairing aircraft and advanced electronic equipment, serving commercial airlines, defense agencies, and industrial customers. The company has demonstrated impressive financial performance, with revenue growth accelerating to 37.26% and a robust gross profit margin of 39.23%. Heico has established itself as a free cash flow (FCF) powerhouse, with FCF per share climbing from $2.83 to $4.02 over the past year, underscoring its strong operational efficiency and ability to generate shareholder value. Despite its remarkable growth and profitability, Heico trades at a premium valuation, with an EV/Sales (NTM) multiple of 8.1x and EV/EBITDA (NTM) of 30.5x, reflecting market confidence in its long-term prospects. While the valuation may deter immediate investment, it positions the company as an attractive candidate for investors seeking high-quality assets to monitor. A significant pullback could provide a compelling entry point, making adding Heico to a watchlist worthwhile.

Trading At A 50% Discount? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Fri, Dec 20, 2024, 10:25 AM 6 min read In This Article: HDELY 0.00% HLBZF 0.00% Key Insights The projected fair value for Heidelberg Materials is \u20ac240 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Current share price of \u20ac120 suggests Heidelberg Materials is potentially 50% undervalued Analyst price target for HEI is \u20ac127 which is 47% below our fair value estimate Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Heidelberg Materials AG ( ETR:HEI ) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple! We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Heidelberg Materials What's The Estimated Valuation? We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF (\u20ac, Millions) \u20ac2.08b \u20ac2.24b \u20ac2.19b \u20ac2.16b \u20ac2.15b \u20ac2.15b \u20ac2.15b \u20ac2.16b \u20ac2.18b \u20ac2.19b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x8 Analyst x7 Analyst x1 Est @ -1.15% Est @ -0.52% Est @ -0.07% Est @ 0.24% Est @ 0.45% Est @ 0.61% Est @ 0.71% Present Value (\u20ac, Millions) Discounted @ 5.7% \u20ac2.0k \u20ac2.0k \u20ac1.9k \u20ac1.7k \u20ac1.6k \u20ac1.5k \u20ac1.5k \u20ac1.4k \u20ac1.3k \u20ac1.3k (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = \u20ac16b After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 5.7%. Story Continues Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = \u20ac2.2b\u00d7 (1 + 1.0%) \u00f7 (5.7%\u2013 1.0%) = \u20ac47b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = \u20ac47b\u00f7 ( 1 + 5.7%) 10 = \u20ac27b The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is \u20ac43b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of \u20ac120, the company appears quite undervalued at a 50% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. XTRA:HEI Discounted Cash Flow December 20th 2024 The Assumptions Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Heidelberg Materials as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.152. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for Heidelberg Materials Strength Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry. Debt is not viewed as a risk. Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows. Weakness Earnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average. Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Basic Materials market. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years. Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value. Threat Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the German market. Next Steps: Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?
