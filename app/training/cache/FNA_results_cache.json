Mustang Mach-E Jamie L. LaReau Sat, Jan 25, 2025, 4:30 PM 4 min read Michigan State Police is testing the all-electric 2024 Ford Mustang Mach-E police vehicle in a special unit that will evaluate the vehicle and then publish the results of its performance to police fleet managers and purchasing agents nationwide \u2014 potentially having a huge impact on Ford Motor Co.'s future police fleet sales. On Monday, the Michigan State Police said it added its first EV, the Mach-E, to use on patrol starting immediately. The car is assigned to the police's State Security Operations Section. Officers in that section are armed, uniformed police who specialize in law enforcement and security at state-owned and leased facilities in the Lansing area, the state police said. \u201cThis is an exciting opportunity for us to research, in real time, how a battery electric vehicle performs on patrol,\u201d Col. James Grady, director of the Michigan State Police, said in a statement. The Michigan State Police added its first all-electric vehicle to its patrol starting Jan. 13, 2025. The 2024 Ford Mustang Mach-E is assigned to MSP\u2019s State Security Operations Section. The state police will evaluate the use of the EV to determine if they will add more. Grady said these security officers patrol substantially fewer miles per day than regular troopers and motor carrier officers, and they stay within city limits at lower speeds. So that fact, combined with the availability of charging stations in downtown Lansing, create a good environment to test a police-package EV, he said. Other police agencies that use the Ford Mach-E include\u00a0Ann Arbor;\u00a0Oakdale, California and\u00a0Westchester County, New York, according to www.officer.com . Ford's expertise in police vehicles Lindsey Bertino, Ford's police brand marketing manager. told the Detroit Free Press that Ford will work with the state police through their annual Police Vehicle Evaluation testing, and with the patrol represented on Ford's Police Advisory Board. She said the Mustang Mach-E Police Pilot program was originally launched as a 2022 model year program and tested at the Michigan State Police's Police Evaluation performance testing. \"We have utilized insight from this testing for continuous improvement to our police vehicles strategy,\" Bertino said. \"We are honored that (Michigan State Police) is using the Mustang Mach-E to help study how alternate powertrains will perform long term in daily patrol duties.\" The results of the Michigan State Police test matter to Ford, as proven a few years ago when Ford put out a news release touting that its all-new 2020 Police Interceptor Utility was given the score of best accelerating and fastest police vehicle in America, according to preliminary test data from the Michigan State Police at the time. Ford said it, \"bested all entries, including V8-equipped sedans, with its EcoBoost-powered all-wheel-drive version of the all-new 2020 Police Interceptor Utility, posting fastest 0-60 mph and 0-100 mph times, as well as fastest lap and fastest average lap.\" Story Continues Ford has a history dating to the early 1900s of offering police vehicles . In 1915, the Oakland, California, police force was so impressed with Ford vehicles that it standardized its fleet of light cars to all Ford models, according to Ford's archives. Car recalls: More than 230,000 Tesla vehicles recalled over rearview camera malfunctions Then, in 1950, Ford was the first automaker to offer a police-package vehicle. It offered three power options: the V-8 special, the Ford 100 horsepower V8 and the Ford 95 horsepower six. It had engineering and design improvements, and special provisions for extra comfort, durability, speed and safety. The police package was popular nationwide, with the New York Police Department ordering 430 Fords, the largest order ever by a department at the time. A 1950 Ford Tudor police vehicle. Today, Ford offers a variety of vehicles equipped for police work, including the F-150 Lightning Pro Special Service Vehicles. In 2023, the Claremont, New Hampshire, Police Department put one of the nation's first Lightning SSV's on the road thanks to the vehicle being donated to it by a local Ford dealership. The Lightning Pro SSV is one of the first EVs purpose-built for police departments.

The 2024 model started at $47,165. Ford spokesman Said Deep said that vehicle is used by many police departments nationwide. The state police paid $39,600 for its Mach-E, spokesman Mike Shaw said. Preproduction unit shown of the 2023 F-150 Lightning Pro Special Services Vehicle. An all-electric version of the Lightning for police use. It is being used by several departments nationwide. 'Potential for cost savings' The Michigan State Police\u2019s Precision Driving Unit is nationally known for its annual Police Vehicle Evaluation . The unit tests and evaluates police vehicles from various manufacturers to include alternative fuel vehicles. The data is compiled and published to help police fleet managers and purchasing agents nationwide determine the best vehicles for their use. \u201cWe began testing battery electric vehicles in 2022, but up until now hybrids were the only alternative fuel vehicle in our fleet,\u201d Lt. Nicholas Darlington, commander of the Precision Driving Unit, said in a statement. \u201cAdding this battery electric vehicle to our patrol fleet will allow us to study the vehicle\u2019s performance long-term to determine if there is a potential for cost savings and broader applicability within our fleet.\u201d State police spokesman Shaw told the Free Press the Mach-E test period before publishing the evaluation is undecided, saying, \"They may do a year-by-year or just one at the end.\" Jamie L.

praetorianphoto / Getty Images According to Statista , the U.S. auto market went from offering 166 vehicle models in 1997 to 285 in 2023 \u2014 and that number is expected to be around 260 this year. Within those umbrella groups are thousands of possible trim levels and engine variations. Check Out: 4 SUVs That Will Have Massive Price Drops in Early 2025 For You: 4 Low-Risk Ways To Build Your Savings in 2025 To help overwhelmed car buyers cut through the clutter and focus on a few standout models, GOBankingRates asked three seasoned mechanics about the vehicles they would buy and why they\u2019re willing to vouch for them. The result is an elite shortlist of eight vehicles \u2014 four new and four used \u2014 that have earned the respect of professionals who know more about cars than just about anyone . New: Toyota Camry If you\u2019re discussing vehicles that have proven to justify their asking price, you have to include the best-selling car in America for the last 20 years. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the market for a new car, think Toyota Camry,\u201d said Todd Bialaszewski, founder of Junk Car Medics , Certified Master Mechanic and ASE Master Technician. \u201cIt\u2019s a solid bet. In my years fixing cars, I\u2019ve seen loads of Camrys. They\u2019re like the trusty workhorse of cars \u2014 good on gas, don\u2019t break down much, and they don\u2019t drop in value like a rock. Just make sure you get it serviced regularly.\u201d Used: Ford Fusion In the previously owned market, consider a beloved American model that was discontinued in 2020 before being reimagined as a lifted wagon. \u201cNow, if you\u2019re eyeing a used car, I\u2019ve got two words for you: Ford Fusion,\u201d said Bialaszewski. \u201cThe models from around 2012 to 2014 are particularly good. They last, drive smoothly and my customers who have them seem really happy. They\u2019re mostly in for small fixes, nothing major.\u201d Be Aware: 6 Used Cars To Stay Away From New: Honda CR-V If you\u2019re going to spend money on a new vehicle, why not go for one that earned a rare and coveted 10 out of 10 rating from Car and Driver? \u201cIf you need more space, check out the Honda CR-V. Great for families or if you haul a lot of stuff,\u201d said Bialaszewski. \u201cThey\u2019re roomy and practical \u2014 a good all-around choice.\u201d Used: Chevy Malibu Bialaszewski\u2019s final pick is an American classic that J.D. Power and RepairPal have hailed for its rock-solid reliability. \u201cAnother good used car is the Chevrolet Malibu, especially the ones made after 2015,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are reliable and comfy on the inside. But, here\u2019s the thing with any car, new or used \u2014 you\u2019ve got to look after it. At my shop, I always hammer this point home. Keep on top of your oil changes, check those brakes, and rotate your tires. Do this, and whatever car you buy should treat you well. Remember, buying a car is a big deal, and taking care of it is what makes it worth your while.\u201d Story Continues New: Hyundai Santa Cruz The Ford Ranchero and Chevy El Camino won over America as the original hybrids \u2014 car in the front, pick-up truck in the back. They\u2019ve been discontinued since the late \u201970s and \u201980s, respectively, but a Korean automaker has taken up the mantle by putting a truck bed on an SUV . \u201cFor new vehicles, check out the Hyundai Santa Cruz,\u201d said Vehicle Freak founder Robert Walden, a mechanic with more than 15 years of experience diagnosing, repairing and building automobiles. \u201cIt drives smoothly like a car but has a lockable truck bed for versatility, giving you the best of both worlds for work and play. The interior is really nice, too. The base engine\u2019s a little slow but overall it cleverly blends pick-up practicality with SUV comfort.\u201d Used: Mazda6 When Mazda discontinued the long-running Capella/626 in 2002, the Japanese automaker had big shoes to fill \u2014 and fill them, it did . \u201cIf you\u2019re looking at used cars for 2023, put the 2018-2021 Mazda6 on your list,\u201d said Walden. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrific midsize sedan \u2014 fun to drive, efficient, stylish, and super reliable. You\u2019ll love being behind the wheel and it\u2019ll treat you right for years. The Mazda6 hits that sweet spot between enjoyment and dependability.\u201d New: Kia Sorento One offering by a Korean automaker continues to earn standout reviews in the crowded mid-size sedan category. \u201cThe new vehicle I would recommend is the Kia Sorento,\u201d said Andy Saari, founder of Nextedge Technician and a 30-year industry veteran who rose from automotive technician to the prestigious titles of Ford Senior Master Technician, ASE Certified Master Tech and GM Certified Technician. \u201cKia\u2019s reliability has improved greatly over the last few years. It has plenty of room for a family, and you can\u2019t go wrong with the 100,000-mile powertrain warranty.\u201d Used: Ford F-150 The entry that might be the best car money can buy isn\u2019t a car at all \u2014 but it is, without any close second, America\u2019s vehicle of choice . \u201cThe used vehicle that I would recommend is the Ford F-150,\u201d said Saari. \u201cIt didn\u2019t become the best-selling truck for 46 years straight by accident. They have a variety of reliable powertrain options and the V-6 Ecoboost has plenty of power for towing. If you do have a problem, parts are readily available due to the sheer volume produced.\u201d More From GOBankingRates 4 Low-Risk Ways To Build Your Savings in 2025 5 2025 SUVs the Middle Class Should
