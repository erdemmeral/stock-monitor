Jangoulun Singsit Tue, Jan 28, 2025, 2:23 PM 3 min read Current commitments for the EOG's Outdoor 2025 show have surpassed the levels recorded at this juncture in the previous year, signalling a growing interest as the period for reduced pricing nears its end. However, the group notes a degree of reservation among certain companies and has called for more industry support. EOG interim managing director Scott Nelson said: \"As a reminder, the concept is in place and was presented with more than sufficient time to plan and include in budgets. The new concept answers the urgent call to provide unique ways to exhibit, while deeply reducing overhead costs. Both the Village with its discount pricing, and the Freestyle area with its size restrictions, do exactly this. It is a dramatic step forwards, and there are now several compelling brands and retailers openly stating that they will exhibit and attend. \u201cWith over 150 committed brands and outspoken retailer support for the concept, we are tempted to celebrate, but not yet. We look squarely at the trade for decisiveness and a renewed sense of urgency. We cannot coerce the remaining brands to stand up and be counted among their peers, but make no mistake, if the show falters, it will not be because of a lack of concept, communication, innovation, support from peers, support from retailers, or brute effort.\u201d The upcoming fair is set to take place from 19-21 May 2025 at Messe Munich. The show will showcase brands from various sectors, including apparel, footwear, equipment, hardware, technology, and ingredients. Among the confirmed exhibitors are Patagonia, Devold, YKK, DMM, Stubai, Kamik, Gore, Sympatex, Sea to Summit, Marmot, Nordisk, ICEBUG, KEEN, Meindl, LOWA, Aku, EXPED, LEKI, Helinox, Mountain Equipment, Rab, and Gregory. In 2024, EOG and Messe Munich undertook a substantial initiative to overhaul OutDoor, aiming to establish a thriving international trade show platform for Europe's outdoor sector. This revamp was driven by a commitment to slash participation costs by '20-20-20' while boosting visitor numbers. The reimagined show promises a diverse range of exhibiting opportunities tailored to various investment levels. \u201cThe EOG will support the voice of the trade, and if the trade demands that OutDoor is not for them, then so be it. But let that not be a decision that is the consequence of a lack of action. The show now has enough support to advance, and we directly ask the remainder of the trade to join us immediately. To sit back and say \u2018we will wait and see\u2019 is frankly not good enough. Stand up and be counted, take a small space in the Freestyle area, come and see your peers, have face-to-face discussions, get an overview of your business, and help us to deliver a successful OutDoor, even in the most economically difficult of years. The time for your action is now. Story Continues \u201cIf the European outdoor industry truly values its international trade show platform - and the opportunity that it provides to bring us all together - then we must aim for this year's show to be even more vibrant than we anticipated. Our sector thrives on developing personal contacts, relationship building and intelligence gathering and OutDoor is the premier moment in the year for all of these, as well as a chance to showcase innovations and campaigns to a big and engaged audience,\u201d Nelson added. The final call for early booking discounts in Village halls is set for 31 January, with flexible options also available in the Freestyle area. In November, EOG partnered with Fair Wear, an initiative that brings together multiple stakeholders to enhance the rights and working conditions of garment workers . \"EOG seeks more industry support for Outdoor 2025 trade show\" was originally created and published by Just Style , a GlobalData owned brand.

(EOG) the Best Hot Oil Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds? Sultan Khalid Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 4:42 AM 6 min read In This Article: EOG +0.48% We recently compiled a list of the 12 Hot Oil Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) stands against the other hot oil stocks. The United States of America is currently producing more oil and gas than any other country in the history of the world, with no signs of a slowdown. The country\u2019s oil production has surged by almost 50% in the last ten years, reaching just over 13.45 million barrels per day in October 2024. READ ALSO: 12 Best Fortune 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy Right Now These numbers could now pump even higher after President Donald Trump has held up the oil industry as a centerpiece of his broader economic mission, with claims that \u2018we will drill, baby, drill\u2019. The president has also signed executive orders declaring a national energy emergency and withdrawing from the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement, the international pact to fight global warming. Trump has also swept aside the freeze on LNG export permits and signed orders to promote oil and gas development in Alaska, though the industry is unlikely to expand there anytime soon. These aggressive steps have raised concerns of higher US output in a market that is already widely expected to be oversupplied this year. As per the International Energy Agency\u2019s recent market outlook, growth in the global demand for oil is expected to slow down in the coming years as energy transitions advance, putting downward pressure on prices. The US Energy Information Administration stated earlier this month that it expects Brent crude oil prices to fall 8% to average $74 a barrel in 2025, then fall further to $66 a barrel in 2026. So it still remains to be seen whether the US oil majors will answer the President\u2019s call and shell out the big bucks required to heavily boost their production. Instead, companies appear to have shifted their focus from aggressive growth to keeping their shareholders happy through fat dividends and generous share buybacks. Despite the falling oil prices, more and more fossil fuel companies are returning a bigger chunk of their profits to shareholders, signaling a clear priority shift away from reinvestment in oilfield development. Several oil bigwigs have even resorted to borrowing to make sure they leave their shareholders satisfied, as revealed by Bloomberg that four of the world\u2019s five oil \u2018supermajors\u2019 saw fit to borrow $15 billion to fund share buybacks between July and September 2024. Therefore, according to a recent survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, only 14% of oil and gas executives plan to significantly increase capital spending this year, while more of them have plans to cut spending instead of ramping it up. But this doesn\u2019t mean that America\u2019s oil and gas sector doesn\u2019t stand to win with Donald Trump in the Oval Office, especially since it poured more than $75 million in donations to his campaign. The American Petroleum Institute, the most powerful oil lobby in the United States, has outlined a wishlist of 70 policy actions it is seeking from Republicans, including issuing a new 5-year offshore leasing program and repealing environmental standards on vehicle emissions.

Darren Barbee Tue, Jan 28, 2025, 5:28 AM 16 min read In This Article: EOG +0.48% Each of the past three World Jigsaw Puzzle Champion winners assembled 500-piece Ravensburger scenes\u2014tigers prowling jungles, blue-chaired outdoor cafes, pastel housing\u2014in less than 40 minutes. As impressive as that is, jigsawing a shale unit map of the Haynesville Shale would clearly be next level. For one, the Haynesville covers about 5.76 million square acres\u2014each a potential piece. And Louisiana state activity maps show shale units in red, preproduction in green triangles. The overall effect is of a Christmassy Lite-Brite project gone too far. Still, it\u2019s what\u2019s not there that could matter. The puzzle for private equity\u2019s startups in all shales is to find the spots that don\u2019t yet shine. And, regardless of the play, it won\u2019t be easy after rampant M&A ransacked the Lower 48\u2019s PE portfolio companies, along with some large publics. Beginning early last year, Post Oak Energy Capital began supporting a number of companies with equity commitments. The companies are working to assemble positions in some of those same lucrative (and expensive) plays as private equity firms begin to rebuild after the running of the M&A bulls. During the latter part of 2024, Oil and Gas Investor caught up with three of the new companies: the Haynesville Shale\u2019s Quantent Energy Partners ; Delaware Basin-focused Ichthys Energy Partners ; and the Utica Shale\u2019s Tiburon Oil & Gas Partners . Building a profitable footprint in any of those plays will be no easy task. Quantent, Ichthys and Tiburon are banking on a network of connections, a feel for their respective plays and a willingness to lock down every profitable piece of acreage still available. All while facing off in the oil and gas version of Squid Game: A&D. The Louisiana state activity map of the Haynesville is so dense that even a jigsaw puzzle master would struggle to find the individual pieces\u2014but that won\u2019t stop companies from trying. (Source: Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources) In the Haynesville, most of the best and biggest blocks of acreage are locked down by major producers waiting to cash in on increased LNG exports. Operators range from privately held Aethon Energy to public E&P Expand Energy, the country\u2019s largest natural gas producer. Expand holds 650,000 net acres in the play and averaged 2,452 MMcfe/d in the third quarter. But Quantent has already locked down one acquisition and sees more opportunities ahead. In the Utica, the liquids-rich areas have been swarmed by new entrants chasing EOG Resources and jockeying with top producers Encino Energy, Ascent Resources and Infinity Natural Resources. Finding a viable large contiguous position will be increasingly difficult there. Scott Hudson, president and CEO of Tiburon, sees a lot more grassroots leasing that can be done in what he calls \u201cpockets\u201d or \u201cdonut holes\u201d in which an operator can pick up three-or five-well units. Story Continues \u201cThose definitely do exist,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re not going to go up into the Utica and pick up 10,000 acres in the windows that we\u2019re talking about today, but there are definitely opportunities out there.\u201d Pieces of the Permian Then there\u2019s the picked-over Permian, which lacks any convenient edges or an inviting lid depicting the sweep of counties stretching from arid Texas to arid New Mexico. With its horizontal wells jutting every which way, the Permian is vast and competitive. And, again, large independent E&Ps and majors hoard the best pieces. The consolidation in the basin, including large-scale deals by Occidental Petroleum, Diamondback Energy and Exxon Mobil , creates a space for Ichthys \u201cto come in and hopefully do some cleanup work on the smaller side, building those assets that way,\u201d Ichthys CEO Michael Poynter said. The other benefit of all the Permian M&A is that, as larger companies get even larger, \u201ctheir appetite and focus on the much smaller interests that take time and some dirty work to piece together into something more valuable is maybe just less meaningful and doesn\u2019t move the needle as much for them.\u201d Post Oak\u2019s teams are largely made up of new blood, unlike the tried-and-true portfolio companies EnCap Investments and Quantum Capital Group that are re-upping with more funding. ( NGP Energy Capital has said it\u2019s unlikely to fund more than a couple of new teams.) Frost Cochran, managing director and founding partner of Post Oak, told Hart Energy in October that Ichthys, based in Dallas, is a group of \u201cyoung guys who are just getting started with their first company, but they\u2019re focusing in the area that they know best, which is the Permian and specifically more, the northern Delaware.\u201d The company\u2019s leadership was spun off of Permian Resources . Cochran said private equity has to source new, younger teams that \u201chave the skill sets and capabilities \u2026 with some support from us from the capital side. And whatever we can do to try to match assets with teams, we do as well.\u201d Some of the Post Oak teams had made initial acquisitions and held acreage out of the gate when the private equity firm committed equity to their ventures. Other teams were still looking. What unites Post Oak\u2019s teams is a shared entrepreneurial drive and that special trait common in startups: confidence in their strategies, experience and expertise. Haynesville 9,000 Quantent CEO Kevin DeLay views the Haynesville\u2019s opportunity set, essentially, as a math equation. The Haynesville comprises 9,000 sq miles\u2014an area larger than the nation of Israel. And within that expanse are a lot of tracts that aren\u2019t getting the attention, or capex, they need. \u201cThey\u2019re underdeveloped either due to lack of capitalization or operational expertise to develop those positions,\u201d DeLay said. \u201cWe really feel like, with our operational background and track record, plus with our ability to be creative on deal structures, there\u2019s a lot of opportunities still left in the Haynesville to get into those parts of play.\u201d DeLay is well-versed on the Haynesville. DeLay served in engineering and management roles at Devon Energy , including operations and portfolio management. He also served as general manager at McClendon Energy Partners and led engineering efforts for several new ventures at Chesapeake Energy founder Aubrey McClendon\u2019s American Energy Partners. \u201cAubrey loved the play,\u201d DeLay said. \u201cHe was always very excited about it. I will admit he was excited when I came to him in 2014 saying I thought the play had bigger potential.\u201d DeLay had observed a set of about 12 wells that had used larger completions\u2014more sand and fluid. \u201cAnd one-for-one, every one of those wells outperformed their direct offsets and gave me a feeling that the Haynesville had a step change of performance in front of it with new completion techniques,\u201d he said. Before co-founding Quantent, DeLay served and directed upstream development projects as COO at Nadel and Gussman New Ventures, which was backed by Post Oak. He largely worked in the Haynesville, drilling out more than 40 wells, often at 20% lower costs than an offset operator. In 2023, the Haynesville was still top of mind. DeLay\u2019s thesis: a lot of potential remains in the play. In September, Post Oak announced the closing of an equity commitment to Quantent and its initial acquisition of 7,000 net acres in North Louisiana. Quantent captured an asset in the play \u201coffsetting an existing asset we had in the Haynesville,\u201d Cochran said. The management team \u201cwas the execution team with that prior asset we worked with. So, it\u2019s really a second iteration with that team on a similar asset.\u201d The company\u2019s strategy is to find untapped inventory and maximize its operational expertise. Following its September acquisition, DeLay said Quantent had a solid proved developed producing (PDP) base. Ultimately, however, the company is looking for places to put the drill bit into the ground while searching for more upside locations through acquisitions. \u201cObviously, if the deal has PDP involved and it works into our economics and we will go after it. But I would say, right now, we are focused on trying to find undeveloped locations,\u201d DeLay said. And the company is in the play for the long haul. \u201cStrategically, anything we buy, we\u2019re going to be willing to fully develop and produce. That has to be the strategy at this point in the cycle of our industry.\u201d And that plays to the strengths of Quantent\u2019s team. DeLay said an important lesson McClendon taught him was the value of expertise. \u201cYour people are the most important part of your company. [You can] have the best rock in the world, but if you don\u2019t have people to execute it, then you\u2019re not going to be a top performer,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we bring in some of, what I consider, the best experts in the field to come drill these wells with us and complete them.\u201d Tiburon set for 2Q Utica drilling Scott Hudson worked in nine shale basins during his career at Carrizo Oil & Gas before the company was sold to Callon Petroleum . About two years ago, Hudson started to think back on one play in particular: the Utica. While digging into the Utica at Carrizo, there\u2019d been no modern day frac techniques brought to bear, he said. Right-sizing well spacing hadn\u2019t been implemented. Around 2013, Hudson was also working without the benefits of fully built out midstream infrastructure, which was a challenge and expense for the company at the time. Hudson\u2019s conclusion: All the lessons that had been applied to the Delaware and Midland basins and the Eagle Ford Shale ought to be brought to the Utica. \u201cI kind of felt like, \u2018Hey, there was a big opportunity.\u2019\u201d And Tiburon was born. Considering the various basins, his expertise and his team\u2019s expertise, the Utica seemed ripe for the picking. And so, Tiburon was built from a team forged at Carrizo, largely with experience in the Appalachian Basin. In mid-October, Tiburon, backed by an investment from Post Oak, closed on an initial acquisition of leasehold in the liquids-rich portion of the Utica. When EOG Resources announced their success in finding oil in the Utica in 2022, the liquids-rich areas were swarmed by new entrants chasing their success and jockeying with top producers. Finding a viable large contiguous position in the play is increasingly difficult. (Source: Shutterstock) Hudson said Tiburon had been working for a year on grassroots leasing. The acquisition, with some other funding, allowed the startup to coalesce a sizeable acreage position with enough running room to get started. \u201cWe\u2019re really excited about how many acres that we have out there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the ability to drill about 30 wells. So, it\u2019s a sizable footprint that we\u2019ve been able to put together.\u201d But, in November 2022, EOG Resources announced what it called the \u201cUtica Combo\u201d play in Ohio, including the acquisition of about 395,000 net acres in Ohio\u2019s volatile oil window and black oil windows. EOG\u2019s publicly disclosed successes in the play quickly overshadowed the play\u2019s gassy reputation. A&D efforts began to focus on liquids. In October, Infinity Natural Resources filed paperwork to launch an IPO. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely gotten a lot more competitive in the last 12 months since EOG announced their presence in the basin, whereas when we started, there were [few] people looking in the basin,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cNow, there\u2019s a ton of competition.\u201d Hudson said the company has built a solid position while actively grabbing additional units where \u201cwe can find additional sticks to drill,\u201d Hudson said. The company has no set parameters on its eventual size. It will likely be a 10-person shop in the near term. For now, the plan is to scout out good opportunities and acquire while setting up rigs, drilling and turning wells to production. The company plans to start production in the second quarter. For now, the team is enthusiastic as it begins to apply advanced completions to the Utica. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to work with Post Oak. They\u2019ve been incredibly supportive,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re ready to get that rig up in the air.\u201d But that\u2019s been the team\u2019s path since their Carrizo days. \u201cWe had this lease and drill strategy where we wanted to go in and we wanted to take our expertise that we\u2019ve had for the last decade, decade and a half, and we wanted to go in and get this opportunity to get this acreage that we had put together and develop \u2026 not drill one or two wells,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to drill the whole well set, and so they believed in that methodology.\u201d Hudson said he\u2019s been in the industry about a quarter of the century\u2014on the young side for oil and gas veterans. \u201cBut yeah, we\u2019re still hungry,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat my team loves to do is lease and drill, lease and drill. That\u2019s what we did at Carrizo together. That\u2019s what we want to do now. And so, we\u2019re just really excited about it.\u201d Permian itch Building a new position in the incredibly competitive Permian Basin can seem daunting, but young and nimble companies like Icthys are banking on their experience and entrepreneurial spirit to make a space for themselves. (Source: Shutterstock) Ichthys\u2019 approach to building a position in the Permian Basin\u2014specifically the northern Delaware\u2014 is to do it any way it can. So far, the company hasn\u2019t made an acquisition. But the company has multiple strategies, including picking up smaller assets that are not meaningful enough for the larger E&Ps to spend time on. Poynter said the initial pitch to Post Oak was focused on the networking, relations and experience his team, with roots in Permian Resources and Colgate Energy , had in Midland, Texas, and in the basin. The more nuts-and-bolts strategy of the company is to create an operated E&P with a focus on a land-first ground game, building up from smaller acquisitions into one or two drillable units at a time. \u201cI think that strategy really resonated with the Post Oak team. It\u2019s reflected in a lot of my past experience of teams that I\u2019ve been on from the private equity company building side where we have done things from sort of the ground up,\u201d he said. \u201cI think, given our backgrounds and the companies, the successful companies that we\u2019ve been at, [we] really fit with that strategy.\u201d However, Poynter said the company\u2019s business development pipeline could range from grassroots leasing to acquiring smaller non-operated interests \u201cwhere we see a strategic angle to trade with other parties or participate in forced pooling, for instance, to maybe the third being farm-in opportunities and strategic partnerships with others in that way.\u201d Another avenue is the post-consolidation rationalization acquirers are likely to engage in. Poynter said the company may look at larger packages or marketed processes. Ichthys CFO Will Weidig said the consolidation-driven asset rationalization deals can be divided into two buckets. \u201cThere\u2019s what I would call the macro bucket and a micro bucket. And the macro would be what Michael mentioned around large marketed assets, where an investment bank is sending out teasers and it\u2019s a $500 million plus [to] $2 billion type of transaction,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s the micro-scale deal, which is kind of what Michael mentioned secondarily, which is the smaller transaction, the DSU that was originally on the drill schedule that now isn\u2019t and therefore creates some kind of optionality for us. I think we\u2019ll be more focused on the latter. And that\u2019s not to say we\u2019ll be fully cut off from the macro bucket, but I think it\u2019ll be more opportunistic to see us engage in something like that.\u201d Poynter added that the company would participate in large deals if a \u201creal strategic edge\u201d emerges \u201cas opposed to us just outbidding other parties.\u201d Poynter said he recognizes the Permian is a highly competitive market, but \u201cthat\u2019s a big part of why we want to be there.\u201d \u201cWe go back to the strategy and the partnership with Post Oak and how that fits and think that this is the right time \u2026 on the consolidation side to be pursuing a strategy like this. I think we also have the right backgrounds from our prior experiences with both private and public companies in the Permian. We\u2019re both intimately familiar with the Permian Basin, but then also our networks within Midland and the Permian, as well.\u201d Weidig said the company\u2019s willingness to be nimble and creative to get deals done is key, \u201cwhether that\u2019s from a structuring perspective, a partnership perspective or just being willing to do a series of smaller transactions versus maybe one splashy larger deal.\u201d \u201cI think all of those will accrue to our benefit as we go out and execute the strategy,\u201d Weidig said. In the next three to five years, Poynter sees Ichthys focused on building units from the ground up and maintaining an ongoing series of operated drilling units that are staggered so that, by the time the first wells are generating cash flow, new wells are being drilled or coming online. \u201cI think my vision a few years from now would be that we\u2019ve made this strategy repeatable enough to have multiple projects going\u201d with varying \u201cmaturation points\u201d and cycles of \u201cdeveloping, partnering, potentially even buying and selling various pieces all simultaneously by that point and continuing to build the business organically.\u2026\u201d Ichthys started with what Poynter called a \u201csort of entrepreneurial itch.\u201d \u201cFor me it was just kind of time,\u201d Poynter said. \u201cWe had accomplished what we set out to accomplish with the Colgate investment and then had seen Permian Resources stabilized and headed in the right direction.\u201d Weidig said he has the same entrepreneurial streak. \u201cFor me, it was identifying timing, a partner to work with and a partner from the private equity perspective, just that really rounded out the picture and made it make sense and look really compelling,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really found that, in terms of what we think is a really attractive market opportunity right now.\u201d All of that added up to, \u201cHey, this is the right time with the right people,\u201d he said, \u201cand, we think, the right strategy to go and execute.\u201d View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard
