During 2024, we strengthened capital levels, controlled core expenses and maintained excellent credit quality.\" Diluted earnings per common share was $0.85 for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared with $0.93 during the linked quarter and $0.72 during the same period last year.

The increase from the previous quarter was primarily due to higher average balance of our earning assets, slowing of deposit mix shift and repricing and lower funding costs, partially offset by lower earning asset yields. The increase from the same period last year was primarily due to higher earning asset yields and higher average balance of our earning assets, partially offset by higher average balance of interest-bearing deposits. Net interest margin was 2.19% in the fourth quarter of 2024, an increase of 1 basis point from the linked quarter and an increase of 6 basis points from the same period last year. The increase from the linked quarter was primarily due to lower interest-bearing deposits rates, partially offset by lower earning asset yields.

Adjusted for this item, noninterest income would have been $45.4 million, an increase of 0.7% from the linked quarter and an increase of 7.5% from the same period in 2023. The increase from the same period last year was primarily due to increases in trust and asset management income, service charges on deposits accounts, and fees, exchange, and other service charges.
