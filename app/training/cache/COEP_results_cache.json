(PRNewsfoto/Coeptis Therapeutics, Inc.) The first day of trading on a post-split basis on the Nasdaq Capital Market, will be at market open on December 31, 2024 . Upon the effective date of the Reverse Split, every 20 shares of the Company's outstanding and issued common stock will be converted into one share of outstanding and issued common stock. No fractional shares will be issued as a result of the reverse stock split. Instead, any fractional shares for record holders that would have resulted from the split will be rounded up to the next whole number. The Reverse Split will not alter any stockholder's percentage interest in the Company's outstanding common stock, except for adjustments that may result from the treatment of fractional shares and will affect all stockholders uniformly. The Reverse Split is intended to help the Company meet the minimum bid price requirement necessary to maintain its listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Under Nasdaq Capital Market rules, a listed company's stock must maintain a minimum bid price of at least\u00a0$1.00\u00a0per share. The Reverse Split was approved by the Company's stockholders at the Company's Annual Stockholder's Meeting on December 18, 2024 , following which meeting the Board then established the reverse split ratio and authorized the reverse split to proceed. Continental Stock Transfer is acting as the exchange agent and transfer agent for the reverse stock split and will send instructions to stockholders of record who hold stock certificates regarding the exchange of their old certificates for new certificates, should they wish to do so. Stockholders who hold their shares in brokerage accounts or \"street name\" are not required to take any action to affect the exchange of their shares.
