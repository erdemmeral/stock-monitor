[{"text": "Insider Buyers Lose US$58k As Ardent Health Partners Sheds US$243m editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sat, Jan 18, 2025, 3:31 PM 3 min read In This Article: ARDT +0.80% Insiders who acquired US$339.6k worth of Ardent Health Partners, Inc.'s ( NYSE:ARDT ) stock at an average price of US$16.98 in the past 12 months may be dismayed by the recent 11% price decline. This is not good as insiders invest based on expectations that their money will appreciate over time. However, as a result of recent losses, their original investment is now worth only US$282.0k. Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Ardent Health Partners Ardent Health Partners Insider Transactions Over The Last Year The Independent Director Robert Webb made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$340k worth of shares at a price of US$17.47 each. That means that even when the share price was higher than US$14.10 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when an insider has purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price. Robert Webb was the only individual insider to buy during the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

Ramish Cheema Thu, Dec 5, 2024, 12:44 AM 6 min read We recently published a list of 10 Best All-Time Low Stocks To Buy Right Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Ardent Health Partners, Inc. (NYSE:ARDT) stands against other best all-time low stocks to buy right now. With November coming to a close, while markets are focused on the future of artificial intelligence and the degree of profitability that AI firms can extract from their multi-billion dollar investments, other factors are also driving investors\u2019 decision-making. The non-AI factors dominating markets include inflation, economic growth, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate reduction cycle. In fact, even though AI has driven the narrative for markets in 2023 and 2024, before it, macroeconomic concerns were the primary factors behind investor decision-making. The US economy grappled with historic inflation following the lax monetary policy during the coronavirus pandemic. To tamp down inflation, the Federal Reserve hiked rates to two-decade-high levels. Now, the macro narrative on Wall Street is driven by how fast the Fed will reduce interest rates. Higher rates and a tight economy have broad implications for stocks. They drive cyclical sectors to low levels and prop up others such as financials and defensives. Additionally, tighter discretionary spending means that high-growth sectors like electric vehicles suffer. High interest rates also constrain sectors such as real estate, while a sluggish economy leads to others such as industrial also lagging major stock indexes. However, when discussing all-time low stocks, one has to keep in mind that their share price often drops not only because of broader sector and market-level trends but also because of microeconomic and firm-specific factors. To understand how microeconomic factors are nearly indispensable factors in driving these trends, consider the shares of one of the most well-known dating applications in the US and worldwide. This stock ranked fourth on our list of the best oversold tech stocks to buy as of late October . Its shares are down 40% year-to-date after having slightly recovered from the 54.14% drop at the time of our coverage. Its stock tanked to an all-time low price of $5.71 the day after the firm released its second-quarter earnings report. Dating applications are a classic example of firms dependent on discretionary spending. For this firm, its earnings report saw Q2 revenue of $268.6 million miss analyst estimates of $273 million. While earnings-per-share of $0.22 did beat analyst estimates of $0.15, they merely reflected cost cutting. The broader slowdown in the dating application market, as evidenced by rival firm Tinder\u2019s shares dropping by 17.8% in November after its third-quarter earnings is evidence of macroeconomic factors that push stocks toward all-time lows. Story Continues However, for the stock under discussion, micro and firm-specific factors also played a role in the stock touching the all-time low level.\u00a0 The accompanying fiscal year revenue growth guidance in the second-quarter earnings is what was responsible for the historic 29% post-earnings share price drop. The firm guided full-year revenue growth to range between 1% and 2%, which was far lower than analyst estimates of 8.4% and the previous guidance of 8% to 11%. Consequently, investors reacted and priced out the over-stretched growth estimates from the share price. These growth estimates were based on firm-specific factors, which as we\u2019ve pointed out above, are key to push any stock to new lows. This strategy has seen it revamp its dating application and seek to bolster revenue by focusing on the Premium Plus segment. However, the ill-fated earnings report saw it announce the decision to \u201cslow down certain monetization efforts like Premium Plus.\u201d As per management , the decision stemmed from a need to re-balance \u201csubscription tiers and merchandising in favor of mechanisms that reward positive peer behaviors and support better ecosystem health.\u201d Naturally, a flip in much-touted growth initiatives at a time when revenue missed guidance and the industry had slowed down did not impress investors and they punished the stock in response. Another stock that touched all-time lows in 2024 is the well-known firm that owns CNN and other media assets. Formed after WarnerMedia\u2019s spin-off and subsequent merger with Discovery, the shares touched $6.71 in August for their lowest reading following the merger in 2022. As was the case with the dating application\u2019s stock, macro and micro factors had a role to play. The firm\u2019s second-quarter earnings saw it report a whopping $10 billion loss and miss analyst revenue estimates of $10.07 by posting $9.71 in revenue. However, while the earnings report wasn\u2019t stellar, the true reason behind the drop was the television network division. The firm\u2019s earnings report saw it write down its media asset value by an unbelievable $9.1 billion which indicated to investors that it had overpaid for them at the time of its merger. Naturally, Wall Street wasn\u2019t impressed and the stock tumbled to a 15-year low if we analyze pre-merger share price performance as well. Our Methodology To make our list of the best all-time low stocks to buy, we made a list of 40 stocks with a market capitalization greater than $300 million that were trading at ranges 0% to 10% above their all-time low price.

ARDT +0.80% PDF file of Ardent Health Q3 2024 earnings press release. BRENTWOOD, Tenn., November 06, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Ardent Health Partners, Inc. (NYSE: ARDT) (\"Ardent Health\" or the \"Company\"), a leading provider of healthcare in growing mid-sized urban communities across the U.S., today announced results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. Third Quarter 2024 Operating and Financial Summary All comparisons are versus the same prior year period, unless otherwise noted. See the footnotes to the Operating Statistics table of this press release for definitions of the metrics below and a full list of key operating metrics. Total Revenue $1.45 billion +5.2% over PY Net Income Attributable to Ardent Health $26 million | $0.19 per basic and diluted share Adjusted EBITDA (1) $98 million +15.3% over PY, margin expansion of 50bps Cash Flow from Operating Activities $90 million Adjusted Admissions 3.8% Growth Y/Y Net Patient Service Revenue per Adjusted Admission 0.9% Growth Y/Y Adjusted EBITDAR (1) $138 million Increase Full-Year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA (1) & Revenue Guidance (1) Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR are non-GAAP financial measures. See \"Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information\" for reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures. Strong Third Quarter Results \u2013 Raising 2024 Guidance \"We are pleased with our third quarter performance,\" stated Marty Bonick, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ardent Health. \"Year-over-year growth in key metrics, including inpatient and outpatient surgeries and admissions, accelerated compared to the first half of 2024. Net income attributable to Ardent Health increased to $26 million and adjusted EBITDA improved 15% year-over-year with margins expanding 50bps to 6.7%.\" \"These results reflect the effectiveness of our consumer-focused growth strategy and operational excellence initiatives,\" continued Bonick. \"We\u2019ve continued our service line optimization initiatives, enhanced supply chain efficiencies, and furthered our technological drive through deployment of new AI initiatives aimed at supporting our caregivers, driving efficiencies, and elevating clinical outcomes. Collectively our strategic initiatives are driving value, positioning us strongly for continued growth.\" \"Our solid third quarter results, coupled with momentum from our strategic execution, give us confidence to increase our 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint by 2% and modestly improve our revenue outlook,\" said Bonick. Financial Performance Summary Total revenue for the third quarter of 2024 grew 5.2% year-over-year to $1.45 billion. This primarily reflects a 3.8% year-over-year increase in adjusted admissions and 0.9% year-over-year growth in net patient service revenue per adjusted admission. Story Continues The third quarter of 2023 benefited from the recognition of approximately $25 million of discrete non-recurring revenue associated with Medicaid supplemental programs, primarily attributable to a one-time allocation to Oklahoma hospitals participating in the Supplemental Hospital Offset Payment Program (\"SHOPP\"). Additionally, in May 2024, the Company made a strategic decision to transfer certain oncology and infusion services to a health system partner. This transition resulted in a revenue reduction of more than $10 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same prior year period, with no material change to adjusted EBITDA. Excluding these items, total revenue growth for the third quarter of 2024 would have been approximately 8%. For the third quarter of 2024, net income attributable to Ardent Health was $26 million, or $0.19 per basic and diluted share, compared to $21 million, or $0.17 per basic and diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 increased 15.3% year-over-year to $98 million, which represented margin expansion of 50bps to 6.7%. The adjusted EBITDA growth was primarily driven by higher patient volumes, increased reimbursement rates, strategic service line optimization, and cost reduction initiatives. Operating Performance Summary The following table provides a summary of certain key operating metrics for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same prior year period. See the footnotes to the Operating Statistics table of this press release for definitions of the metrics below and a full list of key operating metrics. Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 % Change Adjusted admissions 86,833 83,643 3.8 % Admissions 39,568 37,191 6.4 % Inpatient surgeries 8,871 8,826 0.5 % Outpatient surgeries 23,220 23,164 0.2 % Total surgeries 32,091 31,990 0.3 % Emergency room visits 161,343 157,182 2.6 % Net patient service revenue per adjusted admission $ 16,312 $ 16,174 0.9 % Admissions for the third quarter of 2024 increased 6.4% year-over-year, modestly faster than the comparable 5.3% growth in the first half of 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in general medicine, including strong growth in pulmonology and gastroenterology cases, as well as the ongoing impact of the two-midnight rule. Surgeries for the third quarter of 2024 increased 0.3% year-over-year, an improvement from a comparable decline of 1.9% during the first half of 2024. The year-over-year growth in total surgeries of 0.3% reflected increases of 0.5% and 0.2% in inpatient and outpatient surgeries, respectively. As expected, the Company\u2019s strategic service line optimization efforts continued to be a volume headwind for lower margin services, including otolaryngology; however, growth in higher acuity lines, including orthopedics, contributed to a more favorable case mix. Net patient service revenue per adjusted admission for the third quarter of 2024 increased 0.9% year-over-year. The growth rate would have been over 3.0%, excluding the aforementioned $25 million in discrete non-recurring revenue associated with Medicaid supplemental programs recognized during the third quarter of 2023 and the $10 million year-over-year decrease in revenue related to the oncology and infusion service transfer. Balance Sheet, Cash Flow & Liquidity Update As previously announced, during the third quarter, the Company amended its term loan credit agreement with lenders to reprice its term loans. The repricing is expected to generate approximately $5 million in annual interest expense savings and will provide incremental flexibility to pursue capital allocation priorities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents of $563 million and total debt of $1.1 billion. The Company\u2019s net leverage ratio as of September 30, 2024 was 1.6x, as calculated under the Company's credit agreements, and its lease-adjusted net leverage ratio 1 was 3.5x. Ardent Health expects its lease-adjusted net leverage ratio will approach a target of 3.0x by the end of 2024, as the impact of the cybersecurity incident in the fourth quarter of 2023 rolls off. At the end of the third quarter, the Company\u2019s available liquidity was $851 million. During the third quarter of 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $90 million, compared to $89 million in the same prior year period. Other Matters The Company acknowledges the devastation left by Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton across the southeastern U.S. Ardent Health's facilities were not in the hurricanes' paths and, therefore, were not impacted by the storms. Additionally, the Company's supply chain, including its sourcing of IV fluids, has not been impacted to date. Financial Guidance The Company is updating its financial guidance for the full year 2024, increasing revenue and adjusted EBITDA to reflect third quarter results and continued confidence in its business execution. The Company is lowering net income guidance due to a delay in the expected timing of collecting business insurance proceeds related to the cybersecurity incident, partially offset by higher adjusted EBITDA. The Company's expectation for its business insurance claim remains unchanged, with additional proceeds expected to be collected in 2025. All guidance is current as of the time provided and is subject to change. Full Year 2024 Projected (Dollars in millions, except per share amount) Previous Guidance New Guidance Total revenue $5,750 \u2014 $5,900 $5,800 \u2014 $5,875 Net income attributable to Ardent Health Partners, Inc. $163 \u2014 $182 $156 \u2014 $176 Adjusted EBITDA $415 \u2014 $435 $425 \u2014 $440 Rent expense payable to REITs $161 \u2014 $161 $161 \u2014 $161 Diluted earnings per share $1.23 \u2014 $1.37 $1.18 \u2014 $1.32 Adjusted admissions growth 4.0% \u2014 4.5% 4.5% \u2014 5.0% Net patient service revenue per adjusted admission growth 2.3% \u2014 4.4% 2.6% \u2014 3.3% Capital expenditures $170 \u2014 $185 $170 \u2014 $185 ______________________________ 1 Lease-adjusted net leverage is defined as the Company's net debt as of September 30, 2024, plus 8x trailing twelve-month real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") rent expense as of the end of the third quarter of 2024, divided by trailing twelve month Adjusted EBITDAR as of September 30, 2024. The Company\u2019s forecasted guidance is based on current plans and expectations and is subject to a number of known and unknown uncertainties and risks, including those set forth below under the heading \"Forward-Looking Statements.\" The Company does not forecast the impact of items such as, but not limited to, losses (gains) on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt, legal claim costs (benefits) and impairments of long-lived assets because the Company does not believe that it can forecast these items with sufficient accuracy. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred and are out of the Company\u2019s control or cannot be reasonably predicted.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information We have included certain financial measures in this press release that have not been prepared in a manner that complies with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), including Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR. We define these terms as follows: Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income plus (i) provision for income taxes, (ii) interest expense and (iii) depreciation and amortization expense (or EBITDA), as adjusted to deduct noncontrolling interest earnings, and excludes the effects of losses on the extinguishment and modification of debt; other non-operating losses (gains); Cybersecurity Incident recoveries, net of incremental information technology and litigation costs; restructuring, exit and acquisition-related costs; expenses incurred in connection with the implementation of Epic Systems (\"Epic\"), our integrated health information technology system; equity-based compensation expense; and loss (income) from disposed operations. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP performance measure used by our management and external users of our financial statements, such as investors, analysts, lenders, rating agencies and other interested parties, to evaluate companies in our industry. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that is not defined under GAAP and is presented in this press release because our management considers it an important analytical indicator that is commonly used within the healthcare industry to evaluate financial performance and allocate resources. Further, our management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful financial metric to assess our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain material non-cash items and unusual or non-recurring items that we do not expect to continue in the future and certain other adjustments we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operations and our performance. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. While we believe this is a useful supplemental performance measure for investors and other users of our financial information, you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for net income or any other items calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has inherent material limitations as a performance measure, because it adds back certain expenses to net income, resulting in those expenses not being taken into account in the performance measure. We have borrowed money, so interest expense is a necessary element of our costs. Because we have material capital and intangible assets, depreciation and amortization expense are necessary elements of our costs. Likewise, the payment of taxes is a necessary element of our operations. Because Adjusted EBITDA excludes these and other items, it has material limitations as a measure of our performance. Adjusted EBITDAR . Adjusted EBITDAR is defined as Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to add back rent expense payable to REITs, which consists of rent expense pursuant to the master lease agreement (the \"Ventas Master Lease\") with Ventas, Inc. (\"Ventas\"), lease agreements associated with the MOB Transactions (defined below) and a lease arrangement with Medical Properties Trust, Inc. (\"MPT\") for the Hackensack Meridian Mountainside Medical Center. Adjusted EBITDAR is a commonly used non-GAAP valuation measure used by our management, research analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate and compare the enterprise value of different companies in our industry. Adjusted EBITDAR excludes: (1) certain material noncash items and unusual or non-recurring items that we do not expect to continue in the future; (2) certain other adjustments that do not impact our enterprise value; and (3) rent expense payable to our REITs. We operate 30 acute care hospitals, 12 of which we lease from two REITs, Ventas and MPT, pursuant to long-term lease agreements. Additionally, during 2022, we completed the sale of 18 medical office buildings to Ventas in exchange for $204.0 million and concurrently entered into agreements to lease the real estate back from Ventas over a 12-year initial term with eight options to renew for additional five-year terms (the \"MOB Transactions\"). Our management views the long-term lease agreements with Ventas and MPT, as well as the MOB Transactions, as more like financing arrangements than true operating leases, with the rent payable to such REITs being similar to interest expense. As a result, our capital structure is different than many of our competitors, especially those whose real estate portfolio is predominately owned and not leased. Excluding the rent payable to such REITs allows investors to compare our enterprise value to those of other healthcare companies without regard to differences in capital structures, leasing arrangements and geographic markets, which can vary significantly among companies. Our management also uses Adjusted EBITDAR as one measure in determining the value of prospective acquisitions or divestitures. Finally, financial covenants in certain of our lease agreements, including the Ventas Master Lease, use Adjusted EBITDAR as a measure of compliance. Adjusted EBITDAR does not reflect our cash requirements for leasing commitments. As such, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDAR should not be construed as a performance or liquidity measure. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDAR may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. While we believe this is a useful supplemental valuation measure for investors and other users of our financial information, you should not consider Adjusted EBITDAR in isolation or as a substitute for net income or any other items calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDAR has inherent material limitations as a valuation measure, because it adds back certain expenses to net income, resulting in those expenses not being taken into account in the valuation measure. The payment of taxes and rent is a necessary element of our valuation. Because Adjusted EBITDAR excludes these and other items, it has material limitations as a measure of our valuation.

(21) inability to accurately estimate market opportunity and forecasts of market growth; (22) general economic and business conditions, both nationally and in the regions in which we operate; (23) the impact of seasonal or severe weather conditions and climate change; (24) inability to demonstrate meaningful use of Electronic Health Record technology; (25) inability to continually enhance our hospitals with the most recent technological advances in diagnostic and surgical equipment; (26) effects of current and future health reform initiatives, including the Affordable Care Act, and the potential for changes to the Affordable Care Act, its implementation or its interpretation (including through executive orders and court challenges); (27) legal and regulatory restrictions on certain of our hospitals that have physician owners; (28) risks related to the Ventas Master Lease and its restrictions and limitations on our business; (29) the impact of our significant indebtedness, including our ability to comply with certain debt covenants and other significant operating and financial restrictions imposed on us by the agreements governing our indebtedness, and the effects that variable interest rates, and general economic factors could have on our operations, including our potential inability to service our indebtedness; (30) conflicts of interest with certain of our existing large stockholders; (31) effects of changes in federal tax laws; (32) increased costs as a result of operating as a public company; (33) risks related to maintaining an effective system of internal controls; (34) volatility of our share price and size of the public market for our common stock; (35) our guidance differing from actual operating and financial performance; (36) the results of our efforts to use technology, including artificial intelligence, to drive efficiencies and quality initiatives and enhance patient experience;

This metric represents the total number of hospitals operated by us at the end of the applicable period, irrespective of whether the hospital real estate is (i) owned by us, (ii) leased by us or (iii) held through a controlling interest in a JV. This metric includes the managed clinical operations of the hospital at UT Health North Campus in Tyler, Texas (\"UT Health North Campus Tyler\"), a hospital owned by The University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler (\"UTHSCT\"), an affiliate of The University of Texas System. Since we only manage the clinical operations of UT Health North Campus Tyler, the financial results of such entity are not consolidated under Ardent Health Partners, Inc. On April 30, 2024, we closed UT Health East Texas Specialty Hospital, a long-term acute care hospital (the \"LTAC Hospital\") in Tyler, Texas. The LTAC Hospital's inventory and fixed assets were transferred or repurposed to be used by our other hospitals. The LTAC Hospital had 36 licensed patient beds and accounted for approximately $0.0 million and $2.2 million of total revenue and a pre-tax loss of $0.2 million and $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and approximately $2.4 million and $8.0 million of total revenue and a pre-tax loss of $0.8 million and $0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. (2) Licensed beds (at period end). This metric represents the total number of beds for which the appropriate state agency licenses a facility, regardless of whether the beds are actually available for patient use. (3) Utilization of licensed beds. This metric represents a measure of the actual utilization of our inpatient facilities, computed by (i) dividing patient days by the number of days in each period, and (ii) further dividing that number by average licensed beds, which is calculated by dividing total licensed beds (at period end) by the number of days in the period, multiplied by the number of days in the period the licensed beds were in existence. (4) Admissions. This metric represents the number of patients admitted for inpatient treatment during the applicable period. (5) Adjusted admissions. This metric is used by management as a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume. Adjusted admissions provides management with a key performance indicator that considers both inpatient and outpatient volumes by applying an inpatient volume measure (admissions) to a ratio of gross inpatient and outpatient revenue to gross inpatient revenue. Gross inpatient and outpatient revenue reflect gross inpatient and outpatient charges prior to estimated contractual adjustments, uninsured discounts, implicit price concessions, and other discounts. The calculation of adjusted admissions is summarized as follows: Adjusted Admissions = Admissions x (Gross Inpatient Revenue + Gross Outpatient Revenue) Gross Inpatient Revenue (6) Inpatient surgeries. This metric represents the number of surgeries performed on patients who have been admitted to our hospitals. Pain management, c-sections, and certain diagnostic procedures are excluded from inpatient surgeries. (7) Outpatient surgeries. This metric represents the number of surgeries performed on patients who have not been admitted to our hospitals. Pain management, c-sections, and certain diagnostic procedures are excluded from outpatient surgeries. (8) Emergency room visits. This metric represents the total number of patients provided with emergency room treatment during the applicable period. (9) Patient days. This metric represents the total number of days of care provided to patients admitted to our hospitals during the applicable period. (10) Total encounters. This metric represents the total number of events where healthcare services are rendered resulting in a billable event during the applicable period. This includes both hospital and ambulatory patient interactions. (11) Average length of stay. This metric represents the average number of days admitted patients stay in our hospitals. (12) Net patient service revenue per adjusted admission. This metric represents net patient service revenue divided by adjusted admissions for the applicable period. Net patient service revenue reflects gross inpatient and outpatient charges less estimated contractual adjustments, uninsured discounts, implicit price concessions, and other discounts.
