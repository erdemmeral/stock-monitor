[{"text": "ENSC Continues to Announce Potential Life-Changing Results Zacks Small Cap Research Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 2:06 PM 3 min read In This Article: ENSCW +4.35% By Brad Sorensen, CFA NASDAQ:ENSC READ THE FULL ENSC RESEARCH REPORT Ensysce Biosciences (NASDAQ:ENSC) is a clinical stage company that is developing treatments designed to have the same pain-relieving capabilities as opioids but come with the ability to inhibit abuse and overdoses. Opioid abuse is a national crisis, with the CDC estimating over 75,000 deaths from opioid overdoses and there are also exponentially more lives negatively impacted by opioid abuse. Testing on these treatments continues and the company recently announced encouraging interim results from its second clinical trial evaluating PF614-MPAR for overdose protection. The headline from the release is that \u201cThe subjects receiving the MPAR product had a significantly lower total maximum blood concentration of oxycodone compared to PF614 alone, an indication of overdose protection. This news continues a string of positive test results that continue to illustrate the potential of ENSC pain treatments to be game changers. The company also commented that there were no adverse events reported during testing. Management notes it is continuing its testing and is moving quickly to advance these treatments through the process. We also want to remind investors that this testing process is aided by a $14 million multi-year award from the National Institute on Drug Abuse for the purpose of continuing to study MPAR as an overdose inhibitor. Additionally, PF-614-MPAR received an FDA grant of Breakthrough Therapy designation, which allows ENSC the opportunity to accelerate clinical programs and commercialization plans. The grant, which has been applied to fewer than 300 drugs historically, illustrates the importance and urgency that these solutions are needed. We are again reiterating our belief that the treatments being developed by Ensysce will be game changers in the pain relief market and again suggest that investors take a strong look at ENSC. PF614-MPAR has been shown in testing to have the potential to provide much needed pain relief to patients and provides protection against taking too many pills, which often leads to debilitating addiction. The technology involved causes the drug to become inactive when dosing requirements are exceeded\u2014greatly diminishing the \u201cincentive\u201d patients may have to take more than the prescribed dose. Ensysce Biosciences continues to be one of the companies that we cover that we believe most of America would hope is successful and one we are becoming more convinced will achieve its goals. The opioid crisis remains a plague on the American public and is destroying families and entire communities. Ensysce has extremely promising technology in the form of PF614 and PF614-MPAR that are abuse resistant, while still providing the much-needed pain relief that many Americans need with a longer lasting dose than its bioequivalent OxyContin. Story Continues We have written for some time how important the work ENSC is doing is and continue to believe that. We also believe that investors who invest in such important work have the potential to be rewarded quite well as these solutions to a problem plaguing thousands of families come to fruition. We encourage investors to take a look at ENSC and consider the stock before the anticipated positive testing results come in.

Interim Data for Breakthrough Therapy PF614-MPAR Ensysce Biosciences Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 4:00 PM 5 min read In This Article: ENSC -4.62% ENSCW +4.35% Ensysce Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENSC) (\"Ensysce\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing innovative solutions for severe pain relief while reducing the potential for opioid abuse and overdose, today announced interim data from its second clinical trial to evaluate PF614-MPAR for overdose protection. Clinical study PF614-MPAR-102, \u2018A Single and Multiple Dose Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics of Oxycodone and PF614 when PF614 Capsule is Co\u2011Administered with Nafamostat as a Combination of Immediate Release Solution and Extended Release Capsule Formulations (PF614-MPAR) in Healthy Subjects,' was designed to evaluate the full dosage range of PF614-MPAR, study potential food effects, and to conduct a multiple ascending dose study with the final PF614-MPAR combination. In 2024, PF614-MPAR received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and had its development bolstered by a $14 million multi-year award from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) to continue studying the PF614-MPAR overdose protection observed in an initial clinical study, PF614-MPAR-101. The PF614-MPAR-102 study showed that a 100 mg dosage form of PF614-MPAR provides overdose protection when a greater-than-prescribed dose is consumed at one time. Subjects were studied as their own control and received three doses of the overdose-protected PF614-MPAR versus PF614. The subjects receiving the MPAR product had a significantly lower (p=0.0019) total maximum blood concentration of oxycodone (C max ) compared to PF614 alone, an indication of overdose protection. As designed, subjects who received a single 100 mg dose of PF614 or PF614 MPAR showed no difference in C max values (p=0.523). Additionally, safety data from the trial showed that there were no unexpected adverse events from either PF614 or PF614-MPAR. The trial will now continue to enroll the final cohorts of Part 1 of the study and then move to Part 2, which is designed to examine potential food effects. Part 3 will then evaluate repeat dosing of PF614 vs. PF614-MPAR over 4.5 days. The aggregation of interim data allows the Company to focus on perfecting a final drug product to move to commercialization. Dr. Bill Schmidt, Chief Medical Officer of Ensysce, commented, \"Clinical data from our initial study demonstrated the unique overdose protection built into PF614-MPAR, which led to the FDA's Breakthrough Therapy designation, a first for an opioid drug product. This second study builds on the initial data and further demonstrates that MPAR is a vital tool to limit unwanted overdoses from prescription medications. Our goal of bringing PF614-MPAR and a new generation of safer analgesics to the market to alleviate suffering from severe pain is being realized.\" Story Continues Dr. Lynn Kirkpatrick, CEO of Ensysce, added, \"We are delighted with the positive early interim data which confirms that MPAR provides overdose protection in the planned dosage range for our PF614-MPAR drug product. We will continue to quickly execute the final stages of this study using the Translational Pharmaceutics \u00ae platform of Quotient Sciences in advance of our work with our new commercial manufacturing partner to prepare this very unique product for the market. We look forward to completing this highly important three-part trial and generating additional evidence to conduct productive discussions with the FDA on the path to registration for the first overdose-protected opioid.\" About Ensysce Biosciences Ensysce Biosciences is a clinical stage company using its proprietary technology platforms to develop safer prescription drugs.

Biosciences Inc. Wed, Jan 8, 2025, 4:00 PM 11 min read In This Article: ENSC -4.62% ENSCW +4.35% Ensysce Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENSC) (\"Ensysce\" or \"Company\"), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing innovative solutions for severe pain relief while reducing the potential for opioid abuse and overdose, today issued a letter to shareholders from Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Lynn Kirkpatrick. Dear Fellow Shareholders, 2024 was underscored by outstanding progress for our two clinical programs, and I would like to thank you and all of our committed shareholders for their support over the last year. We have achieved several key milestones in our efforts to develop our highly novel approach to providing opioid pain relief while reducing abuse and prescription drug overdose, an approach that we believe will save many lives. I welcome this opportunity to summarize last year's events and milestones achieved and to present a look ahead to what we believe will be another exceptional year in 2025. Our focus in 2024 was to continue the advancement of our two clinical programs built around our TAAP\u2122 and MPAR\u00ae platforms. Our lead product PF614, a Trypsin-Activated Abuse Protection (TAAP TM ) extended-release oxycodone, will spearhead our \"next generation\" analgesic portfolio. The TAAP TM chemical modification is designed to control the rate of release of a known prescription drug and to be highly resistant to tampering for recreational use, thereby reducing abuse via non-oral routes of administration including snorting, chewing or injecting. Our second drug candidate PF614-MPAR, built on the platform of PF614, has added oral-overdose protection, and is a combination product of PF614 with a trypsin inhibitor. MPAR\u00ae (Multi-Pill Abuse Resistance) is designed to deliver powerful pain relief yet \"switches off\" the release of the opioid in an overdose situation, providing an additional layer of protection to Ensysce's TAAP\u2122 medications. This represents an industry first and a major breakthrough for Ensysce that was recognized by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) with Breakthrough Therapy designation in January 2024. These two programs are positioned to be approved at a vital time, with the safety of opioids and limited access to pain medication being some of the most critical healthcare issues in the U.S. today. We believe our TAAP\u2122 and MPAR\u00ae opioids can act as a solution by providing relief to the millions of people in the U.S. suffering from severe and chronic pain who are now struggling to gain access to drugs that provide them with an improved quality of life. Story Continues In 2024, we made significant progress toward our development milestones for PF614. Early in 2024, we completed a regulatory End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, an important discussion about our program which provided feedback and guidance on the design of our Phase 3 clinical program, ultimately reducing the regulatory risks for our commercialization plan. We also announced the peer reviewed online publication of our manuscript reporting the results of our second clinical study of PF614 entitled, \"Clinical evaluation of PF614, a novel TAAP TM prodrug of oxycodone, versus OxyContin\u00ae in a multi-ascending dose study with a bioequivalence arm in healthy volunteers\" in Clinical and Translational Science (CTS), a journal of the American Society of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (ASCPT). The results from the two-part PF614\u2011102 study demonstrated a clear dose relationship between PF614 and oxycodone release. Importantly, the study established the bioequivalence between PF614 and OxyContin, which can potentially lead to using the streamlined 505(b)(2) path to registration. Mid-year, we submitted the Phase 3 study protocol and statistical analysis plan for regulatory review by the FDA. This PF614-301 study, entitled \"A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo- and Active-Controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of PF614 for the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Pain after Abdominoplasty\", intends to evaluate PF614 versus placebo for pain relief in subjects undergoing abdominoplasty surgery. Feedback on the Phase 3 design was received in December, and we are now reviewing Contract Research Organizations (CROs) to select an experienced team to work with to successfully execute this important study which we expect to start enrolling in the second quarter of 2025. We enter this Phase 3 study having support that PF614 delivers a known and effective analgesic and we look forward to being able to provide an update in our next annual letter. Our MPAR program also continued to advance in 2024. The Breakthrough Therapy designation for PF614-MPAR, received in January, is provided to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition where the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies. This rare designation from the FDA speaks to the innovation of our MPAR\u00ae overdose protection platform. Additional regulatory guidance from the FDA was received in February for the PF614-MPAR non-clinical program, aiding its progression toward a new drug application (NDA) submission and accelerating its pace to market. To progress the clinical development of PF614-MPAR, we renewed our collaboration with Quotient Sciences and received approval from the Investigational Review Board (IRB) to undertake the Phase 1b study, PF614-MPAR-102, \"A Single and Multiple Dose Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics of Oxycodone and PF614 when PF614 capsule is Co\u2011Administered with Nafamostat as a combination Immediate Release solution and Extended-Release Capsule Formulation in Healthy Subjects\". This study will examine the full commercial dose range of the PF614-MPAR drug product to verify both overdose protection and effective delivery of oxycodone. The study is applying the Quotient Sciences Translational Pharmaceutics\u00ae platform to manufacture and test the PF614-MPAR drug product, expediting the clinical study process. Following receipt in September of a $14 million dollar award from the NIH, described below, the study was quickly implemented, and in November, the first group of subjects were enrolled and successfully dosed. We look forward to completing this three-part trial in 2025. The data generated will provide the basis to undertake additional productive discussions with the FDA regarding the development path to registration of this combination product, the first overdose-protected opioid. 2024 also saw a critical milestone achieved for our Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) program. Based on the data package that had been built over the last few years, we were able to select PF9001 as the lead drug candidate. PF9001 is designed using our TAAP TM and MPAR \u00ae technology to provide a safer treatment for the millions of Americans who are suffering from opioid overuse and addiction. A critical benefit of PF9001 is its lower potential for cardiovascular side effects compared with traditional methadone OUD treatments. As we position our analgesic portfolio for commercial-scale production, we have established several strategic partnerships to strengthen our manufacturing capabilities. Today, PF614 drug substance is being produced for clinical trial use and will see commercial scale-up in 2025 through Purisys LLC. Most recently we initiated a strategic partnership with a leading specialty drug product manufacturer for the development and commercial launch of both PF614 and PF614-MPAR. This partnership will provide us with clinical trial material, drug products for regulatory submissions, and initial commercial batches of PF614 and PF614-MPAR. Additional services encompass the complete manufacturing process, including packaging, labeling, and shipment of the products, ensuring a seamless transition from regulatory approval to market entry. To reinforce the innovative science and positive results of our programs, we presented the continued development progress of our programs at the following global events: Annual National Institutes of Health (NIH) \"Helping to End Addiction Long-term\" (HEAL) Initiative Scientific Meeting, Bethesda, MD. 2024 American Association of Pain Medicine (AAPM) Meeting, Los Angeles, CA. European Pharmaceutical Market Research Association (EPHMRA) Annual Conference, London, UK. International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) 2024 World Congress on Pain, Amsterdam, NL. Society for Neuroscience Meeting, Chicago IL. Formulation & Delivery US 2024, San Diego, CA. 18 th Annual Pain Therapeutics Summit, Boston, MA. Company led financing activities in 2024 that supported the significant milestones of our three programs included a warrant inducement transaction in February that provided $4.7 million in gross proceeds and a financing transaction in August which raised $5 million in gross proceeds. Additionally, in August, we received a non-dilutive $14 million multi-year grant from the NIH and National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) for the continued development of PF614-MPAR. Funding from this award will complete the Phase 1b clinical trial, PF614-MPAR-102, as well as non-clinical studies required for our NDA submission for both PF614 and PF614-MPAR. This grant brings the total non-dilutive funding awarded since 2018 to $40 million. Looking ahead, we are focused on the continued rapid execution of our clinical development milestones for PF614 and PF614-MPAR. With the selection of a CRO, we intend to initiate activities in Q1 of 2025 to allow us to complete the PF614 Phase 3 study in 2025. Our current plans have us on track to submit our PF614 New Drug Application in 2026 with commercialization to follow. We are advancing our MPAR \u00ae program with our second clinical study underway. This safety and pharmacokinetic study will generate data for an interim review in the first quarter of 2025, which we will use to build the balance of the study dosing plan. Our non-clinical OUD program is continuing, and following discussions with NIDA in early 2025, we expect to advance to Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling studies, with ambitions to initiate a Phase 1 study in 2026. Altogether, we are incredibly proud of our accomplishments in 2024, completed with tightly managed resources. We believe 2025 will be another strong year for Ensysce, with pivotal data anticipated by year end. We are grateful to our committed shareholders in helping us achieve our goals. We remain confident in our potential to play a key role in providing safer pain medication for those suffering with severe pain, whether short-term or chronic, while we also provide options to address the prescription drug abuse crisis in the U.S. I look forward to sharing additional exciting milestones in the year to come.

Position Zacks Small Cap Research Wed, Nov 13, 2024, 1:00 PM 3 min read In This Article: ENSCW +4.35% By Brad Sorensen, CFA NASDAQ:ENSC READ THE FULL ENSC RESEARCH REPORT Ensysce Biosciences (NASDAQ:ENSC) released its 3Q2024 results that showed a much improved cash balance of $4.2 million due in large part to the grant described below and some financial offerings which we have detailed in the past. The company continues to make progress, but notes that future revenue will likely be lower than that seen in 3Q due to the expiration of one grant. Company management also noted that the company\u2019s stock has regained compliance with the NASDAQ stock exchange\u2014a very positive development in our view. Earlier in the quarter, the company announced that it has received a $14 million grant from the National Institute of Health (NIH) for the continued clinical development of PF614-MPAR\u2014the company\u2019s abuse-deterrent opioid with overdose protection. The award will be paid over three years and, according to the company, allowing for the completion of the Phase 1b clinical trial. This award creates multiple positive impacts for the company. First, the money from the grant will help fund operations and further clinical testing, while allowing the company to limit future potential dilution to shareholders. Additionally, the award represents, in our view, another positive vote from a respected medical organization that has seen the initial data and believes in the potential benefits of this treatment. We aren\u2019t going to rehash recent reports that have outlined the positive test results for PF614 and PF614-MPAR. But, as a reminder, these tests have shown that PF614 can provide the much-needed pain relief that is currently available through the highly abused oxycodone, while having abuse resistant properties and lasting longer. Additionally, an important reminder that PF-614-MPAR received an FDA grant of Breakthrough Therapy designation, which allows ENSC the opportunity to accelerate clinical programs and commercialization plans. The grant, which has been applied to fewer than 300 drugs historically, illustrates the importance and urgency that these solutions are needed. We are again reiterating our belief that the treatments being developed by Ensysce will be game changers in the pain relief market and again suggest that investors take a strong look at ENSC. PF614-MPAR has been shown in testing to have the potential to provide much needed pain relief to patients and provides protections against taking too many pills, which often leads to debilitating addiction. The technology involved causes the drug to become inactive when dosing requirements are exceeded\u2014greatly diminishing the \u201cincentive\u201d patients may have to take more than the prescribed dose. Story Continues Ensysce Biosciences continues to be one of the companies that we cover that we believe most of America would hope is successful and one we are becoming more convinced will achieve its goals. The opioid crisis remains a plague on the American public and is destroying families and entire communities. The National Institute on Drug Abuse reported more than 107,000 overdose deaths in 2022\u2014and that doesn\u2019t count the millions of family members and friends impacted by those deaths. Ensysce has extremely promising technology in the form of PF614 and PF614-MPAR that are abuse resistant, while still providing the much-needed pain relief that many Americans need with a longer lasting dose than its bioequivalent OxyContin. We have written for some time how important the work ENSC is doing is and continue to believe that. We also believe that investors who invest in such important work have the potential to be rewarded quite well as these solutions to a problem plaguing thousands of families come to fruition. We encourage investors to take a look at ENSC and consider the stock before the anticipated positive testing results come in.

(NASDAQ:ENSC) (\"Ensysce\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing innovative solutions for severe pain relief while reducing the potential for opioid abuse and overdose, today announced that on Friday, December 6, 2024, effective at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time, it will implement a 1-for-15 reverse split of its common stock. The Company's common stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis when the market opens on December 6, 2024, under its current trading symbol \"ENSC\". The new CUSIP number of the Company's common stock following the reverse stock split will be 293602 504. The reverse stock split is intended, among other things, primarily to increase the bid price of the Company's common stock to enable the Company to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 per share for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. When the reverse stock split becomes effective, every 15 shares of the Company's common stock issued and outstanding will be combined and reclassified automatically into 1 share of common stock. The reverse stock split will affect all holders of common stock uniformly and each stockholder will hold the same percentage of common stock outstanding immediately following the reverse stock split as that stockholder held immediately prior to the reverse stock split, except for adjustments that may result from the treatment of fractional shares. No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Any amount of fractional shares will be rounded up to the nearest whole number at the participant (per broker) level. The Company's transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, will act as the exchange agent for the reverse stock split. Stockholders of record will receive information from Continental regarding their stock ownership following the reverse stock split. Stockholders owning shares via a bank, broker or other nominee will have their positions automatically adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split and will not be required to take further action in connection with the reverse stock split, with such adjustment subject to each bank, broker or other nominee's particular processes.

Completes Significant Milestone, Dosing First Subjects in Breakthrough Therapy PF614-MPAR Trial Ensysce Biosciences Inc. Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 4:00 PM 4 min read In This Article: ENSC -4.62% ENSCW +4.35% Ensysce Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENSC) (\"Ensysce\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing innovative solutions for severe pain relief while reducing the potential for opioid abuse and overdose, today announced that it has treated its first group of subjects in the PF614-MPAR-102 study. PF614-MPAR received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and had its development bolstered by the recent $14 million multi-year award from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Dr. Lynn Kirkpatrick, CEO of Ensysce, was quoted, \"Overdose from prescription drugs is still a major societal issue and Ensysce may have the first opioid that can reduce deliberate and accidental overdoses. My team has made this program a priority as we continue to collaborate with Quotient Sciences using their Translational Pharmaceutics \u00ae platform. We are delighted with the speed at which Quotient has executed the trial start-up activities and advanced into subject dosing as we aim to receive early interim data in the first quarter of 2025. We look forward to completing this highly important three-part trial and generating additional evidence to conduct productive discussions with the FDA on the path to registration for the first overdose-protected opioid.\" Dr. Bill Schmidt, Chief Medical Officer of Ensysce, commented, \"Clinical data from our initial study demonstrated the unique overdose protection built into PF614-MPAR, which led to the FDA designation of Breakthrough Therapy, a first for an opioid drug product. We believe this second study will further build on our initial data and aid in bringing PF614-MPAR and a new generation of safer analgesics to the market to alleviate suffering and bring relief to those who experience severe pain.\" The trial \u2018A Single and Multiple Dose Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics of Oxycodone and PF614 when PF614 capsule is Co\u2011Administered with Nafamostat as a combination Immediate Release solution and Extended-Release Capsule Formulation in Healthy Subjects', is designed to evaluate the full dosage range of PF614-MPAR, study food effects and to conduct a multi-ascending dose study.

Ensysce Biosciences, Inc. Wed, Nov 13, 2024, 12:15 AM 11 min read In This Article: ENSC -4.62% ENSCW +4.35% Awarded $14 Million Multi-Year NIH Grant and Initiated Second Clinical Trial for Breakthrough Therapy PF614-MPAR Submitted Pivotal PF614 Phase 3 Protocol to the FDA for Review SAN DIEGO, CA / ACCESSWIRE / November 12, 2024 / Ensysce Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENSC) (\"Ensysce\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing innovative solutions for severe pain relief while reducing the potential for opioid abuse and overdose, today reported financial and operational results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. Dr. Lynn Kirkpatrick, Chief Executive Officer of Ensysce, commented, \"Our team has made significant progress in the third quarter, and we have line of sight to meaningful clinical initiatives to close out the year. The highlight of the third quarter was NIH's recognition of the potential value provided by our overdose protection technology MPAR\u00ae, by awarding Ensysce with a $14 million multi-year grant to further the clinical development of PF614-MPAR. The support from the NIH allows the completion of a second Phase 1b trial, PF614-MPAR-102. We believe the data from this study will cement PF614-MPAR as the first opioid with oral overdose protection, a game-changer for those suffering with severe pain while mitigating potential abuse and overdose.\" Dr. Kirkpatrick continued, \"We also built on FDA feedback from our End of Phase 2 meeting in February to complete our Phase 3 protocol and have submitted it to the FDA. We expect FDA feedback by the end of November to allow us to complete plans to execute the study over the coming year. Our August financing transaction that raised $5 million in gross proceeds allows us to advance to clinical site selection for our pivotal Phase 3 trial for PF614, and the $14 million MPAR\u00ae grant has allowed us to rapidly initiate our second trial for PF614-MPAR. We anticipate the results from these clinical studies will continue to build on our prior positive safety data to bring our innovative and premium pain products to market. Lastly, we are applying our TAAP and MPAR technology to our opioid use disorder program and look forward to moving the lead agent into clinical development in the coming years.\" TAAP TM (Opioid Abuse Deterrent Program) Update Our lead product, PF614, is a Trypsin-Activated Abuse Protection (TAAP TM ) extended-release oxycodone and a potential \"next generation\" analgesic for severe pain. The Company's TAAP TM technology is designed to control release, be highly resistant to tampering, and reduce abuse through a unique chemical modification. PF614's TAAP TM modification makes it inactive until it is swallowed and exposed to the body's own trypsin in the small intestine to activate or \"switch on\" to release oxycodone. Story Continues During the third quarter, the Company submitted to the FDA for regulatory review the protocol and statistical analysis plan for its anticipated final Phase 3 study, PF614-301. The study is entitled \"A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-and Active-Controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of PF614 for the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Pain after Abdominoplasty\". MPAR\u00ae (Opioid Abuse Deterrent and Overdose Protection Program) Update PF614-MPAR, designed to treat severe pain with added oral overdose protection, is a combination product of the TAAP TM prodrug PF614 with a trypsin inhibitor. MPAR\u00ae (Multi-Pill Abuse Resistance) reduces or \"switches off\" the release of the opioid only in an overdose situation, providing an additional layer of protection to Ensysce's TAAP\u2122 medications. The clinical data from the first clinical trial, PF614-101, demonstrated that the MPAR\u00ae technology reduces release and absorption of oxycodone from PF614 when consumed in more than a prescribed dose, leading to the FDA's Breakthrough Therapy designation in January of this year. During the third quarter, the Company received approval from the Investigational Review Board (\"IRB\") of the PF614-MPAR-102 protocol, \u2018A Single and Multiple Dose Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics of Oxycodone and PF614 when PF614 capsule is Co\u2011Administered with Nafamostat as a combination Immediate Release solution and Extended-Release Capsule Formulation in Healthy Subjects.' The Site Initiation Visit has been undertaken and the study is on track to initiate subject dosing this quarter. To execute this study, Ensysce has continued its collaboration with Quotient Sciences to use their Translational Pharmaceutics\u00ae platform to perfect the drug product. As reported in August, the Company received a $14 million multi-year grant from the NIH, National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) to fund this clinical study as well as the necessary non-clinical studies to support an NDA (New Drug Application) for PF614-MPAR. Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) Program Update The Company recently announced the selection of its lead OUD drug candidate PF9001 that has been designed using Ensysce's TAAP TM platform. The intent of the program is to reduce both the abuse profile and the cardiovascular side effects associated with traditional methadone OUD treatments. The program is finalizing required studies supported by a multi-year Helping to End Addiction Long-Term (HEAL) award of up to $15 million granted by the NIH and NIDA and anticipates advancing to Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling studies in the coming year. Q3 2024 Financial Results Cash - Cash and cash equivalents were $4.2 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $1.1 million as of December 31, 2023. A key driver for the increase in cash was cumulative net proceeds of $8.5 million from equity financings in February and August 2024. Stockholders' Equity - Stockholders' equity was $6.6 million as of September 30, 2024, a level compliant with the $2.5 million stockholders' equity requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). Federal Grants - Funding under federal grants totaled $3.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $0.4 million in the comparable year ago quarter. The increase is due to the timing of research activities eligible for funding, with increased activities under the OUD grant following the selection of a lead drug candidate in June. Funding under the current phase of the OUD grant was completed in August 2024. Also contributing to the increase is the recently awarded MPAR grant, with payments for clinical activities for PF614-MPAR initiated during the quarter. With the completion of the OUD grant, funding under federal grants is expected to decline in coming quarters from the level of the third quarter of 2024. Research & Development Expenses - R&D expenses were $1.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $1.9 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease of $0.2 million was primarily the result of reduced external research and development costs related to clinical and pre-clinical programs for PF614 in the 2024 period. Increased activities on the OUD and MPAR programs are expected to result in higher research and development expenses in coming quarters. General & Administrative Expenses - G&A expenses were $1.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $1.2 million for the third quarter of 2023, a slight decrease of $0.1 million. G&A expenses are expected to approximate current levels in the coming quarters. Other Income (Expense) - Total other income (expense), net, was consistent with income of $17,023 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to income of $16,508 for the same period of 2023. Net Income (Loss) - Net income attributable to common stockholders for the third quarter of 2024 was $0.7 million compared to a net loss of $2.7 million for the third quarter of 2023. The Company recorded net income in the third quarter due to the timing of federal grant funding received, with the completion of funding under the OUD grant and the start of funding under the MPAR grant both occurring during the quarter. With only the MPAR grant moving forward, net income for the third quarter is expected to be a one-time event and we do not anticipate net income in coming quarters. As a clinical stage biotech company, our continued research and development efforts toward regulatory approvals for our product candidates are expected to result in losses for the foreseeable future.
