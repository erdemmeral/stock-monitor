-1.93% - Seeking to initiate Phase 3 registrational trial for larsucosterol with topline results expected within two years of initiation -\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Webcast of Earnings Call Today, November 13 at 4:30 p.m. ET CUPERTINO, Calif. , Nov. 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- DURECT Corporation (Nasdaq: DRRX) today announced financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and provided a business update. DURECT Corporation (www.durect.com) is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the development of epigenetic therapies that target dysregulated DNA methylation to transform the treatment of serious and life-threatening conditions, including acute organ injury and cancer. \"We remain focused on preparations for the Phase 3 trial for larsucosterol in severe alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH), including discussions with U.S. clinical sites and hepatologists, to streamline the initiation process,\" stated James E. Brown , D.V.M., President and CEO of DURECT.\u00a0 \"Our goal is to begin the trial as soon as possible, subject to obtaining sufficient funding, which should enable us to report topline data within two years of trial initiation. If successful, the FDA has agreed that a single Phase 3 trial may be sufficient to support a New Drug Application (NDA).\u00a0We believe the selected primary endpoint of 90-day survival is clinically meaningful and provides the greatest probability of success based on the Phase 2b AHFIRM data. We look forward to initiating the trial as soon as possible. We believe that larsucosterol, if approved, could provide physicians with a much-needed treatment that could significantly improve the current 90-day mortality rates of approximately 30%.\" Recent business highlights and updates: DURECT announced details on the design of its planned registrational Phase 3 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of larsucosterol for the treatment of patients with severe alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH). The trial will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study conducted in the U.S. The primary endpoint will be 90-day survival. The trial design incorporates feedback we received from the U.S. FDA during a Type B meeting held under Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) as well as learnings from our prior Phase 2b AHFIRM trial in AH. DURECT's goal is to begin the trial as soon as possible, subject to obtaining sufficient funding, with topline results expected within two years of trial initiation. DURECT plans to deliver an oral and two poster presentations at The Liver Meeting 2024, organized by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) , to be held November 15-19, 2024 in San Diego, California . These presentations will showcase additional data from the completed Phase 2b AHFIRM trial which evaluated larsucosterol for the treatment of alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH). The data further support the design of the Company's planned Phase 3 trial of larsucosterol, including the importance of timely treatment in clinical outcomes. Top line data from AHFIRM were previously announced in November 2023 . On November 8, 2024 , DURECT received notice that Innocoll Pharmaceuticals is terminating its license agreement for POSIMIR\u00ae (bupivacaine solution), effective in May 2025 . Innocoll has committed to transfer all data and know-how related to POSIMIR to DURECT, and the company is evaluating next steps with respect to the commercialization of POSIMIR.

About the AHFIRM Trial AHFIRM was a Phase\u00a02b\u00a0randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international, multi-center study conducted in subjects with severe alcohol-associated hepatitis ( AH ) to evaluate the sa F ety and eff I cacy of la R sucosterol treat M ent (AHFIRM). \u00a0The study was comprised of three arms and enrolled 307 patients, with approximately 100 patients in each arm: (1) Placebo, which consists of standard of care, with or without methylprednisolone capsules at the investigators' discretion; (2) larsucosterol (30 mg); and (3) larsucosterol (90 mg). \u00a0Patients in the larsucosterol arms received the same supportive care without steroids. \u00a0The primary outcome measure was the 90-day incidence of mortality or liver transplantation for patients treated with larsucosterol compared to those treated with placebo, and the key secondary endpoint was 90-day survival. \u00a0The Company enrolled patients at clinical trial sites across the U.S., EU, U.K., and\u00a0Australia. In\u00a0November 2023, the Company announced topline data for the AHFIRM Trial. Reflecting the life-threatening nature of AH and the lack of therapeutic options, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted larsucosterol Fast Track Designation and Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of AH. \u00a0For more information, refer to ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04563026. About Alcohol-associated Hepatitis (AH) AH is an acute form of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) associated with long-term heavy alcohol intake, often following a recent period of increased consumption (i.e., a binge). \u00a0AH is typically characterized by severe inflammation and liver cell damage, potentially leading to life-threatening complications including liver failure, acute kidney injury and multi-organ failure. \u00a0There are no FDA approved therapies for AH, and a retrospective analysis of 77 studies published between 1971 and 2016, which included data from 8,184 patients, showed the overall mortality from AH was 26% at 28 days, 29% at 90 days and 44% at 180 days. \u00a0A subsequent global study published in\u00a0December 2021, which included 85 tertiary centers in 11 countries across 3 continents, prospectively enrolled 2,581 AH patients with a median Model of End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score of 23.5, reported mortality at 28 and 90 days of approximately 20% and 31%, respectively. \u00a0Stopping alcohol consumption is necessary, but frequently not sufficient for recovery in many moderate (defined as MELD scores of 11-20) and severe (defined as MELD scores >20) patients, and therapies that reduce liver inflammation, such as corticosteroids, are limited by contraindications, have not been shown to improve survival at 90 days or one year, and have demonstrated an increased risk of infection. \u00a0While liver transplantation is becoming more common for ALD patients, including AH patients, the total number of such transplants is still relatively small, and limited by organ availability.\u00a0 Average charges for a liver transplant exceed\u00a0$875,000, and patients require lifelong immunosuppressive therapy to prevent organ rejection. About Larsucosterol Larsucosterol is an endogenous sulfated oxysterol and an epigenetic modulator. \u00a0Epigenetic regulators are compounds that regulate patterns of gene expression without modifying the DNA sequence. \u00a0DNA hypermethylation, an example of epigenetic dysregulation, results in transcriptomic reprogramming and cellular dysfunction, and has been reported in many acute (e.g., AH) and chronic diseases (e.g., MASH). \u00a0As an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3a and\u00a03b), larsucosterol inhibits DNA methylation, which subsequently modulates expression of genes that are involved in cell signaling pathways associated with stress responses, cell death and survival, and lipid biosynthesis. \u00a0This may ultimately lead to improved cell survival, reduced inflammation, and decreased lipotoxicity. \u00a0As an epigenetic modulator, the proposed mechanism of action provides further scientific rationale for developing larsucosterol for the treatment of acute organ injury and certain chronic diseases. About DURECT Corporation DURECT is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the development of epigenetic therapies that target dysregulated DNA methylation to transform the treatment of serious and life-threatening conditions, including acute organ injury. Larsucosterol, DURECT's lead drug candidate, binds to and inhibits the activity of DNA methyltransferases, epigenetic enzymes that are elevated and associated with hypermethylation found in AH patients. Larsucosterol is in clinical development for the potential treatment of AH, for which the FDA has granted a Fast Track and a Breakthrough Therapy designation; MASH is also being explored. In addition, POSIMIR \u00ae (bupivacaine solution) for infiltration use, a non-opioid analgesic utilizing the innovative SABER \u00ae platform technology, is FDA-approved.
