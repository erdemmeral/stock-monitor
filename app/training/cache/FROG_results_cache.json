[{"text": "Former UCF assistant Ted Roof files breach of contract lawsuit against school Orlando Sentinel \u00b7 Willie J. Allen Jr./Orlando Sentinel/TNS Matt Murschel, Orlando Sentinel Updated Sat, Jan 25, 2025, 6:04 PM 2 min read Former UCF defensive coordinator Ted Roof has filed a lawsuit against the UCF Athletics Association, claiming a breach of contract. The lawsuit, which was filed in Orange County on Friday, claims that the school adjusted his termination compensation after head coach Gus Malzahn resigned. Roof is seeking more than $50,000 in damages, according to the lawsuit. Roof joined Malzahn\u2019s coaching staff on Jan. 17, 2024, after serving as defensive coordinator at Oklahoma in 2022-23. He signed a two-year contract with the school that paid him a base salary of $400,000 last season and $750,000 in \u201925. The contract was highly incentive-laden, with bonuses available if the team achieved certain milestones, such as winning a conference championship or playing in a bowl game. Malzahn fired Roof on Oct. 28 following the Knights\u2019 37-24 loss to BYU and presented him with a formal termination letter. He was replaced by Addison Williams, who served as co-defensive coordinator. According to the lawsuit, Roof\u2019s contract stipulated that in the event of termination, \u201cThe amount due to Employee for remainder of term shall be the balance due of the base salary and bonuses earned but not yet paid, to be paid in accordance with normal Athletics payroll procedures, and shall be reduced by any subsequent employment compensation.\u201d UCF basketball aims to end losing streak when it faces TCU Saturday The lawsuit states that Roof is entitled to the remainder of his base salary from \u201924-25. Malzahn resigned on Nov. 30, 33 days after Roof was terminated without cause. According to the lawsuit, Roof received a letter from UCF on Dec. 6, notifying him that UCF was \u201cretroactively applying the terms of Employment Agreement relating to the resignation Gus Malzahn as Head Football Coach.\u201d The provision that UCF was basing its argument on stated that: \u201cIn the event of the resignation of Gus Malzahn as Head Football Coach, this agreement may be terminated and the employee shall be entitled to receive 90 days of pay at the seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($750,000) annual rate, effective as of the resignation date of the Head Football Coach.\u201d The lawsuit states that the provision is meaningless because it only applies if the school still employed Roof at Malzahn\u2019s resignation. Winter Park attorney Victor Chapman of Barrett, Chapman and Ruta P.A. represents Roof. When contacted by the Sentinel, a UCF athletics spokesperson said UCFAA had not yet been served with a formal complaint, and since it\u2019s a legal issue the department would have no comment.

{"text": "Wall Street Enters Darker Age With Most Stock Trading Hidden Katherine Doherty Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 6:48 PM 4 min read (Bloomberg) -- Here\u2019s a surprising new fact about the world\u2019s largest and most-liquid public equity market: Most of the activity on it isn\u2019t public anymore. Most Read from Bloomberg What Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? Vienna Embraces Heat Pumps to Ditch Russian Gas Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30 For the first time on record, the majority of all trading in US stocks is now consistently occurring outside the country\u2019s exchanges, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This off-exchange activity \u2014 which happens internally at major firms or in alternative platforms known as dark pools \u2014 is on course to account for a record 51.8% of traded volume in January. Barring an unexpected dip, it will be the fifth monthly record in a row, and the third month running that hidden trades make up more than half of all volume. In other words, the shift \u201cappears to be developing into a longer-term trend and quite possibly a permanent one at that,\u201d Anna Ziotis Kurzrok, head of market structure at Jefferies, wrote in a note to clients this month. Off-exchange trading has been a growing feature on Wall Street for years, but until now public venues including the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq have retained overall dominance of market activity. That\u2019s important because exchanges display the quotes that most participants use to price stocks. The shift toward off-exchange trading is the culmination of a years-long trend, which if it continues could eventually have implications for how the market functions, according to Larry Tabb, head of market structure at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cTheoretically the more trading that goes off-exchange, the fewer orders there are on-exchange competing to determine the best price,\u201d he said. \u201cThis means the pricing on and off-exchange could get worse.\u201d The Securities and Exchange Commission has in recent years taken steps to try to push more activity back on-exchange by revamping market structure. Of four proposals made by the SEC, only two rules \u2014 that tweak the way stocks get priced and trades are executed on and off-exchange \u2014 were ultimately passed. For now the threat to market efficiency remains a distant concern, with 48.2% of trades in January still happening on-exchange. Instead, the change is perhaps more useful as an indicator of the evolving market landscape. Kurzrok at Jefferies notes that the surge in off-exchange activity corresponds with increased volumes in stocks worth less than $1, which are typically traded by retail investors. That makes sense, since that business is often handled internally by market-making giants like Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial. Story Continues When those sub-dollar stocks are stripped out of the data, off-exchange trading remains below 40% of total volume, according to calculations by Jefferies. So the apparent shift away from exchanges \u201cdoesn\u2019t necessarily mean trading in one stock or all stocks is going to be worse off on any particular day,\u201d Kurzrok said. Meanwhile, the number of off-exchange venues that offer an alternative, anonymous way to process trades has been growing. These alternative-trading systems, or ATS, use different mechanisms to match buyers and sellers without the desired price being displayed on a public exchange, or automated auctions where parties express the value they are willing to buy or sell stocks for. Using those venues helps institutional investors limit information leaking to the market and adversely affecting prices. \u201cThis new style of trading is different,\u201d said Joe Saluzzi of Themis Trading. \u201cThe bigger institutions seem to have a better experience where they can command more value.\u201d About 1.7 billion shares a day changed hands on an ATS in November, the most since March of 2020 and 36% more than a year prior, according to analysis from Bloomberg Intelligence. At Nasdaq, the second-largest US exchange, Head of Strategic Operations and Public Policy Chuck Mack says the worry is that the move toward off-exchange could ultimately make pricing less efficient and drive up costs for investors and issuers. \u201cSometime down the road we may look back and say, \u2018how did we get here?\u2019\u201d Mack said. \u201cIt\u2019s like boiling a frog. If you boil a frog, the temperature slowly rises, it doesn\u2019t realize and doesn\u2019t jump out so it dies. You don\u2019t realize until it\u2019s too late.\u201d (Updates with comments from Nasdaq.)

Games Critics Of All Time Has Died John Walker Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 7:20 PM 10 min read Screenshot: Amiga Power There is a reasonable chance you have not heard of Jonathan Nash. However, the games journalist and comedy writer has been such an inspiration for a generation of games critics, and the generation inspired by them, that his influence has almost certainly reached you. J Nash was extraordinary, and I\u2019m very sorry to report he has died. I also can\u2019t wait to tell you why you will want to read everything he ever wrote. There\u2019s a thing about life, and the thing about life is this: it is immensely complicated. So began a review of the wholly forgotten 1994 Commodore Amiga game Sub, in the pages of the always capitalized AMIGA POWER . It continued, No matter how long you stick with it, there\u2019s always something you can\u2019t quite get to grips with or, indeed, begin to understand one tiny bit at all. Unfortunately life doesn\u2019t come with an instruction book, but if it did, it would undoubtedly be a badly translated instruction book with lots of sentences that had a very good but ultimately unsuccessful stab at making sense. And, d\u2019you know, in these respects, life would be a lot like this game. Which you could accuse of leaning into cliche, were it not followed by, So wrote Stan Wallpaper in his now standard textbook, \u2018101 Extremely Contrived Introductory Paragraphs.\u2019 Thanks, Stan. It changed my life. The UK had a fair few influential gaming magazines, but perhaps none more so than AMIGA POWER. The magazine launched or boosted the careers of a large number of writers, many of whom would go on to form magazines you know like PC Gamer, as well as launch the careers of famous names like former games journalist and current comics writer Kieron Gillen. The magazine\u2019s finest writer was Jonathan Nash, a unique voice whose astonishing prose forced everyone around him to aim to keep up. No one could. The best sorts tried. I first read Nash\u2019s work as a child, a 12-year-old reading through the magazine that made me want to be a writer, Your Sinclair. I would seek out his reviews, because they were the funniest by far, though I was still far too young to appreciate the wholly unnecessary level of skill that went into every review of a cassette-based 16-color video game based on a recent action movie. It all seeped into my brain, started defining me in indelible ways. Without Jonathan Nash, and the cohort of writers at Your Sinclair and AMIGA POWER, there would never have been a Rock Paper Shotgun, given that at least three of the four of us who began that site somewhat viewed our games journalism careers as a sort of pasty tribute act to the man. Story Continues This is not a proper obituary, and I fail to mention some of his greatest moments, but instead just a celebration of the way the man put words in front of one another. Jonathan had a way of putting words together that no one else would ever think to try, with results that would make me gasp as I read them. Even in an email, Nash would phrase things in such a way that I\u2019d want to pin it to a board and dissect it to find its secret, only to find myself covered in gory letters and be none the wiser. On one occasion, when he was writing a deeply strange and complex text-based video game, I demanded of him a prize for being the first person to complete its demo. He replied, \u201cYou are correct. Nobody else has managed this, possibly because they have run out of proteins.\u201d Last night, as the awful news of Jonathan\u2019s untimely passing spread among his former colleagues and friends, my messages were filled with people sharing favorite lines of his, screenshots of throwaway gags they\u2019d never forgotten from magazines published 35 years ago, desperate searches to find scans of PC Gamer from the 90s that Future Publishing hadn\u2019t spitefully deleted from the Internet Archive, anything to try to capture the essence of Nash\u2019s writing and what it meant to us. Man Of Mystery J Nash (as many of his closest friends called him) may not even have been called Jonathan Nash. I\u2019ve always had my suspicions. His love for Victorian obscurity has long made me wonder if he named himself after Jonathan Nash Hearder , an electrical engineer of the 19th century. Our J Nash was a deeply mysterious figure, often unseen by anyone who knew him for five or more years at a time, who then might suddenly show up on a doorstep unannounced (a thing that actually happened). He co-wrote sitcoms with people that never met him, and created archives of work that were never publicised, but always astonishing . But he will be remembered more for one era than any other: his time on AMIGA POWER. It\u2019s hard to convey what this magazine was to people who never read it, let alone never lived in the country where it was published. It was a gaming magazine for the Commodore Amiga home computer that was written with the energy of the music magazines of the \u201870s and \u201880s, but imbued with a silliness that undermined all its venom. Multiple companies hated it, primarily for its no-holds-barred disdain for publishers and its merciless coverage of terrible games. Team 17\u2014the developer perhaps best known for the Worms series\u2014loathed AP, once even issuing a lawsuit . (The letter was framed and hung on the wall of the office.) Multiple publishers blacklisted them (always a sign a publication is doing something right), and some even made abusive phone calls . It was gently anarchic, with a priority of telling the truth, then being funny, and after that there\u2019s nothing else that mattered. And its most powerful voice was Nash. Everyone wrote brilliantly, but Nash was the king. It was those turns of phrase, those unique bizarrities, that made even a spoof of a cop show feel fresh. Like this opening for a review of an FPS Doom knock-off called Fears. Screenshot: Amiga Power Nash\u2019s review of 1994's Doofus was written out as a conversation between God and a new arrival in the afterlife, punished to play the game for all eternity for his sins. No one writes reviews as conversations between God and new arrivals in the afterlife any more. PC Gamer\u2019s Golden Years Ploughing through old issues of UK PC Gamer from the mid-90s, I keep finding lines of Nash\u2019s that just delight me. A preview of Wetrix in 1997 began, Victorian gentlefolk used to amuse their children\u2014those who weren\u2019t poor and reeked of chimneys, of course\u2014with perplexing illusions. Clad in your smock, you\u2019d receive a book illustrated with drawings of old women that, after you\u2019d looked at them for a while, turned unexpectedly into pit-terriers. Your mind would reel and you\u2019d be driven to run an iron foundry, wear a silly beard and slaughter prostitutes with an axe. In another issue from the same year, Nash begins an report of his visit to the studio of developer Rowan, midway through development of fighter plane game MiG Alley,like this: Craftily I refer to Steve Owen\u2019s 92% Flying Corps review of Rowan\u2019s previous game, Flying Corps. With MiG Alley, have you finally got round to contoured terrain? Flying Corps\u2019 big unhilly map was, after all, a bit of a disappointment. Scour the internet, read every gaming site, and try to find me anyone opening their articles with such elaborate treats. I know I\u2019m not. This piece goes on to contain the line, \u201cRod\u2019s work on the flight models is so detailed you\u2019d expect him to safely glide to earth if he ever fell off a ladder.\u201d And I cannot let you down by not giving you the ending of the piece. Once more, Rod manages not to cry at my pudding-headedness. \u201cClassic jet dogfights are very different from WW1 or modern ones...\u201d And who would win in a fight between Biggles and Alan Alda in a large cupboard over the disputed ownership of a Toyota Corolla? \u201cAlan Alda, because he\u2019d change the rules. Biggles would refuse to travel back in time to try again, as he did in his feature film, because that would be cheating. Coincidentally,\u201d he adds warmly, \u201cBiggles was my first WW1 flight sim.\u201d I\u2019ll keep going, since you\u2019re here and can\u2019t leave. A preview for some ridiculous attempt at making a 3D version of Frogger contains lines like, Frogger, readers who steeple their fingers to promote thought and healthful blood flow may recall, was a 1981 arcade game about this thing: a frog, who had to jump across a motorway and a river without perishing squashingly, in order to reach a hole in which he looked uncommonly pleased. I could die happy if I ever wrote a paragraph that brilliant about something so utterly unimportant. Hell, if I had a brain that could think up \u201cperishing squashingly,\u201d I\u2019d be twice the person. A Legend There are many legends about Jonathan Nash that I\u2019ve heard over the years, all of which cast him in the most wonderful light, and in an industry rife with spoilsports and chancers, I have never heard a single person say a negative word about him in the 20-something years I\u2019ve been in a position to have heard it. He was tremendous, the best writer of all of us, and I\u2019m devastated that he\u2019s gone. In the final issue of AMIGA POWER, where all regular staff were contractually obliged to be dead by the end of their articles, Nash reviewed Team 17's pretty crappy Alien Breed 3D 2, which he\u2019d scored 98 because \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to do a false [score]... I strongly dislike the idea of neat little summaries absolving people of reading the review and await someone rushing in to say, \u2018AB3D2 has scored 98%!\u2019 at which I\u2019ll raise my head from the crumpled heap in which I\u2019m contractually obliged to lie, ha ha at them and then fall lifeless.\u201d The piece ends, Now cut mentally to a shot of my victorious assailants crowding round in such a manner as to conceal me from camera, observing, \u2018Why, it\u2019s just a cork pop-gun,\u2019 then in a surprise twist shock reversal bluff ending saying, \u2018Wait a minute - this is just some kind of highly advanced automaton big doll thing,\u2019 and the sound of me chuckling a-ha ha ha, correctly punctuated, as you see a complicated shiny control panel that is shut into a roll-desk by my figure which passes from shot, a final pull-out showing the desk in the study from the first scene, a quietly beautiful view of Canada framed in the window. Good heavens; I\u2019ve escaped. With the review\u2019s wrap-up box under the score reading, In a doubly surprising twist shock reversal bluff post-credits sequence, there is a low shot angled upward of Jonathan standing outside looking pleased; he is then squashed by a falling anvil. .

Listed on Indoex & Azbit King Newswire Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 5:30 PM 6 min read $PEPEY Coin is setting out to carve a new path available for trading on centralized exchanges like Indoex and Azbit. Developed and supported by a leading technology solutions company, $PEPEY is poised to make a significant impact in the meme coin ecosystem on Indoex. Pepey's success stems from its close association with the iconic Pepe meme and the strong community of meme coin enthusiasts. A Strong Foundation: PEPEY's Vision and Identity The PEPEY Coin project is more than just another meme coin-it represents a new narrative in the cryptocurrency space. As the Solana network continues to thrive, the PEPEY team, consisting of experienced developers, aims to introduce a revolutionary meme coin to this ecosystem. Unlike other meme coins, which can sometimes be driven purely by speculative hype, $PEPEY is designed to create long-term wealth for its holders while playing an active role in the broader cryptocurrency revolution. $PEPEY's distinctive narrative is centered around the idea of \"PEPEY as the Queen to PEPE's King.\" By embracing the concepts of royalty, with terms like \"Queen,\" \"King,\" and \"Kingdom,\" PEPEY Coin aims to establish itself as a symbol of female empowerment in the world of meme coins. As the \"wife\" of PEPE, $PEPEY introduces a bold, vibrant, and empowering female figure to the meme coin ecosystem, a space that has long lacked a strong female representation. This creative and elegant branding sets PEPEY apart from the countless other meme coins that have flooded the market. Historic Launch: Token Burn and Market Growth The $PEPEY launch made history by executing a token burn of 351 trillion tokens, marking the largest burn ever recorded in cryptocurrency history. This unprecedented move permanently reduced the total supply of $PEPEY to 69.69 trillion tokens, which is seen as a milestone in the crypto world. The burned tokens, representing approximately $772,200 in market cap value at the time of the burn, have set a new standard for other projects to follow. Since its launch on January 7th, 2025, the PEPEY Coin project has surpassed a market cap of $200,000, with its current market cap hovering around $150,000. The project has attracted over 500 holders in its first 10 days, and the community continues to grow organically. $PEPEY is actively traded across multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and one centralized exchange (CEX), consistently achieving new all-time highs each day. One of the most significant milestones in the early stages of the PEPEY Coin project is its successful application for listing on CoinMarketCap (CMC), a major cryptocurrency data platform. In addition, PEPEY is now listed on CoinPaprika, a popular crypto tracking platform, and has been successfully listed on Azbit, the project's first centralized exchange. The PEPEY team is also in discussions with a range of Tier 1 to Tier 3 exchanges to secure additional listings and increase the token's exposure. Story Continues Growing Community and Media Attention The $PEPEY community has grown rapidly in a short time, and the project is now attracting attention from a wide variety of stakeholders, including game developers, story writers, and media outlets. Top online cryptocurrency sites have already extended invitations to feature $PEPEY's story once its market cap reaches $10 million, which is expected to happen in the near future. The project is also finalizing an online text-based interview with Chris Beverly from MemeCoinSeason.io, a key influencer in the meme coin space. BrandPush, a team of skilled professionals known for their expertise in writing business stories, is also working closely with the PEPEY project to craft and publish the $PEPEY story, which will be shared across various media platforms to further increase awareness and engagement. The support for $PEPEY is not just coming from investors and enthusiasts, but also from a growing base of global volunteers who are helping to spread the word about the project and assist with its outreach efforts. This strong community-driven approach is a key part of the project's strategy to create lasting value for its holders and build a sustainable ecosystem. Investor Interest and Strategic Growth In addition to organic community growth, $PEPEY has secured interest from private and angel investors who are eager to support the project in its quest to reach a $1 billion market cap. The PEPEY team is actively encouraging investors to purchase and hold $PEPEY tokens, as this is seen as a critical step toward achieving the project's long-term goals. Unlike many other projects, the PEPEY team is committed to protecting the token's value by refraining from airdrops or giveaways, which can often lead to market dumps and destabilize the value of the coin. To further boost the presence of $PEPEY across social media platforms, the team is actively engaging with influencers, Reddit and Discord advertisers, and crypto YouTube personalities. The goal is to drive awareness and encourage broader participation in the project. A robust marketing budget is in place, which will be used to fund press releases, video content, and advertising campaigns to ensure that PEPEY reaches a wide audience and continues to build momentum. PEPEY Coin's future is bright, with numerous exciting developments on the horizon. Within the next 24-48 hours, $PEPEY will be listed on MintMe, a platform that will introduce the coin to a new community. Additionally, the PEPEY team is working on completing applications (including KYC) for all available cryptocurrency data platforms within the next two weeks, further increasing the token's visibility. After surpassing a $100K market cap, the PEPEY project received several inquiries regarding potential collaborations with the well-known PEPE Coin community. The team is currently verifying the identities of these parties and awaiting formal collaboration proposals, which could help propel the project to even greater heights. The Road Ahead: A Billion-Dollar Meme Coin PEPEY Coin is not just another short-lived meme token-it is a serious project with big aspirations. The goal is to reach a $1 billion market cap, and the team is committed to making that vision a reality. Through technological innovation, honesty, and a commitment to empowering the community, $PEPEY is on track to become one of the most significant meme coins in the cryptocurrency market. With a strong development team, a clear and engaging narrative, a robust marketing strategy, and growing support from investors and the community, $PEPEY is set to take the meme coin world by storm. Whether you're a seasoned crypto investor or a newcomer to the space, $PEPEY represents an exciting opportunity to be part of a project that is truly breaking new ground in the world of digital currencies. As the PEPEY Coin project continues to evolve, one thing is clear: everything is in trusted hands, and the future of $PEPEY is brighter than ever.

Kayode Omotosho Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 12:05 PM 3 min read In This Article: FROG +1.99% JFrog (FROG): Buy, Sell, or Hold Post Q3 Earnings? Over the past six months, JFrog\u2019s shares (currently trading at $32.56) have posted a disappointing 14% loss, well below the S&P 500\u2019s 8.1% gain. This might have investors contemplating their next move. Following the pullback, is this a buying opportunity for FROG? Find out in our full research report, it\u2019s free . Why Does FROG Stock Spark Debate? Named after the founders' affinity for frogs, JFrog (NASDAQ:FROG) provides a software-as-a-service platform that makes developing and releasing software easier and faster, especially for large teams. Two Positive Attributes: 1. Billings Surge, Boosting Cash On Hand Billings is a non-GAAP metric that is often called \u201ccash revenue\u201d because it shows how much money the company has collected from customers in a certain period. This is different from revenue, which must be recognized in pieces over the length of a contract. JFrog\u2019s billings punched in at $132 million in Q3, and over the last four quarters, its year-on-year growth averaged 27.5%. This performance was fantastic, indicating robust customer demand. The high level of cash collected from customers also enhances liquidity and provides a solid foundation for future investments and growth. JFrog Billings 2. Outstanding Retention Sets the Stage for Huge Gains One of the best parts about the software-as-a-service business model (and a reason why they trade at high valuation multiples) is that customers typically spend more on a company\u2019s products and services over time. JFrog\u2019s net revenue retention rate, a key performance metric measuring how much money existing customers from a year ago are spending today, was 118% in Q3. This means JFrog would\u2019ve grown its revenue by 18% even if it didn\u2019t win any new customers over the last 12 months. JFrog Net Revenue Retention Rate JFrog has a good net retention rate, proving that customers are satisfied with its software and getting more value from it over time, which is always great to see. One Reason to be Careful: Operating Losses Sound the Alarms While many software businesses point investors to their adjusted profits, which exclude stock-based compensation (SBC), we prefer GAAP operating margin because SBC is a legitimate expense used to attract and retain talent. This is one of the best measures of profitability because it shows how much money a company takes home after developing, marketing, and selling its products. JFrog\u2019s expensive cost structure has contributed to an average operating margin of negative 19.8% over the last year. This happened because the company spent loads of money to capture market share. As seen in its fast revenue growth, the aggressive strategy has paid off so far, and Wall Street\u2019s estimates suggest the party will continue. We tend to agree and believe the business has a good chance of reaching profitability upon scale. Story Continues JFrog Operating Margin (GAAP) Final Judgment JFrog\u2019s merits more than compensate for its flaws. With the recent decline, the stock trades at 7.6\u00d7 forward price-to-sales (or $32.56 per share). Is now the right time to buy? See for yourself in our full research report, it\u2019s free .

$36 trillion to be more precise. For decades people have raised concerns about these rising numbers and experts and politicians have worked to try to reduce the debt as they make an effort to better the economy. Because this has been a long-standing issue, it is difficult to identify specifically when the debt problem could escalate into a greater crisis. On this week\u2019s episode of Capitol Gains , Bipartisan Policy Center Executive Director of Economic Policy Shai Akabas joins anchor Rachelle Akuffo , Washington Correspondent Ben Werschkul , and Senior Columnist Rick Newman to talk about the national debt, and when the United States could face an actual debt crisis. Akabas is concerned the country is getting closer to that tipping point. \u201cWe\u2019re at 100% GDP, meaning that debt is about the size held by the public is [also] about the size of our economy. That\u2019s a very high level, and it\u2019s almost unprecedented in US history and we\u2019re headed much, much higher than that.\u201d Video correlati 03:54 Trump\u2019s Tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China Will Drive Up Expenses WSJ \u2022 9 hours ago 02:11 China Retaliates Against Trump\u2019s Tariffs With New Levies on U.S. WSJ \u2022 14 hours ago 04:37 The 'three-fold' applications of Trump's tariff strategy Yahoo Finance Video \u2022 16 hours ago 05:13 Retaliatory Tariffs on US Would Have Severe Impact: Smart Bloomberg \u2022 17 hours ago Though Akabas is confident we\u2019ve \u201cpassed the point where we could hit some type of major economic downturn or unforeseen event,\u201d like the COVID-19 pandemic or great recession, the country needs to get a handle on the situation sooner rather than later. \u201cWe've been the proverbial frog in the pot where the water is getting warmer and we think it's just feeling nice and cozy in there until it gets too hot where we start to burn,\u201d Akabas explains. \u201cI'm afraid that we're going to get that to that point before we realize it. And only when we realize it are we going to have to start implementing really dramatic policies that are not in the best interest of our economy and our country moving forward.\u201d To learn more about this, listen to the full episode of Capitol Gains here .

had help in what critics say is the \u2018biggest gaming fraud in history\u2019 Elon Musk faces accusations he hasn\u2019t been entirely honest about his skills as a video gamer in a brewing controversy. \u00b7 Fortune \u00b7 Andrew Harnik\u2014Getty Images Christiaan Hetzner Updated Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 12:37 AM 4 min read In This Article: TSLA -5.17% A bizarre scandal is brewing about whether Elon Musk lied about being one of the world's best video game players. Now claims have emerged in which Musk seems to admit he did secretly enlist help. Elon Musk, Tesla CEO and one of the world\u2019s wealthiest individuals, has claimed he holds top scores in competitive gaming during his limited free time. Musk\u2019s achievements have earned praise from podcasters Joe Rogan and Lex Fridman, and he has frequently shared gaming milestones on his platform, X . \u201cSo many life lessons to be learned from speedrunning video games on max difficulty,\u201d Musk posted in November after completing a level in Diablo IV . \u201cTeaches you to see the matrix, rather than simply exist in the matrix.\u201d Some speculate Musk\u2019s gaming claims were aimed at boosting engagement on X (which he owns), particularly among Twitch streamers and gaming influencers. It takes dozens or hundreds of hours of gaming to reach the top levels in the games where Musk claims he is the best, and people are wondering how he did that while also running Tesla, SpaceX , X, the Boring Company, and working for President Trump. Some serious players are accusing Musk of falsifying his gaming standings. One YouTube analysis of his gaming calls it \" the biggest gaming fraud in history .\" Did Musk seemingly admit to having help from others? In a series of direct messages exchanged with another Diablo player, who Musk verifiably follows on X as of today's date, the entrepreneur seemed to reveal he has other people helping him climb the leaderboard table on Path of Exile 2 , a title published by Grinding Gear Games. Niko Wrex asked Musk whether he hired other people to do some of the heavy lifting on his behalf. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to beat the players in Asia if you don\u2019t, as they do!,\u201d Musk replied in a DM. \u201cBut when I post a video of a game or am streaming, that\u2019s 100% me.\u201d https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPUCfqVIRWI&t=122s&ab_channel=AsmongoldTV Musk has not commented on this exchange from his own account, either to verify or deny it. But Wrex took viewers through the DMs to show he was not concocting some elaborate scheme to deceive people. The video now has over 2.3 million views . It has been shared by Asmongold , who has been in direct communication with Musk recently over whether to begin streaming on his X platform. Asked by Wrex whether it was ever his intention to take full credit for his characters reaching the top of a leaderboard, the reply from the Musk account was clear. \u201cNo,\u201d came the answer. \u201cNever claimed that.\u201d Musk\u2019s gaming account on X, which he runs under the handle \u201c cyb3rgam3r420 ,\u201d repeatedly referred to his character and never once implied anyone else was playing. Story Continues \u201cMaking rapid progress with my new Path of Exile character, Kekius Maximus !\u201d he posted at the end of last month. In the DM exchange, Musk went on to claim that other top accounts were run by multiple players as well, although he offered no proof. Typically, top-ranked players stream their runs in their entirety, often for hours on end, to prove their accomplishments. Musk attempts to laugh the controversy away Fortune reached out for comment both to Musk as well as Grinding Gear Games, but neither responded at the time of publication. Quin, the streamer whose accusations earlier this month first launched the controversy, did not mince words in response to the DMs: \u201cElon Musk is clearly, blatantly cheating.\" Multiple big-name gamers steeped in the culture previously called him out for lying about his record. Apart from Asmongold, who challenged Musk to prove his claims , popular streamer Penguinz0 called the scandal a \u201c mask-off moment \u201d for Musk. So far, the entrepreneur has neither definitively confirmed nor denied the accusation first levied by New Zealand gamer Quin. Last week , however, the Tesla CEO attempted to laugh off the controversy by joking that he had \u201cYilong Ma\u201d playing for him, a reference to a well-known Elon Musk impersonator from China. Musician Grimes rushes to the defense of her children's father The strange nature took another twist this weekend when not one but two of the women who gave birth to several of his children felt obligated to support Musk on social media. First , singer Grimes, who has been locked in a custody battle with Musk in the past, on Saturday vouched for him as indeed being the best Diablo player in America. \u201cI did observe these things with my own eyes. There are other witnesses who can verify this,\u201d she posted. However, she agreed that he should be honest about his Path of Exile 2 record. Then Neuralink\u2019s Shivon Zilis followed with her own fond recollection of Musk\u2019s exploits in Diablo IV from over a year ago. \u201cHe took breaks for family meals and Xmas presents but was too excited for sleep,\u201d she added . Musk thanked them both.
