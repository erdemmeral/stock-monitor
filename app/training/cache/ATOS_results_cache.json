[{"text": "AI, Cloud and 5G Are Reshaping Telecom, Media and Entertainment Delivery Models in EMEA: ISG Business Wire Tue, Jan 28, 2025, 12:00 PM 5 min read In This Article: III +7.52% ISG Provider Lens\u2122 report says streaming wars and new regulations are driving transformation and technology adoption in Europe LONDON, January 28, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--A new research report by leading global technology research and advisory firm Information Services Group ( ISG ) (Nasdaq: III ), says AI adoption, cloud migration and 5G deployment are driving significant transformation in the telecom, media and entertainment (TME) industry in Europe. The 2024 ISG Provider Lens\u2122 Telecom, Media and Entertainment Industry Services report for Europe, the Middle East and Africa finds enterprises are leveraging AI for customer service, content recommendations and network optimization while accelerating their shift to multicloud architectures and edge computing. \"The streaming wars are intensifying, and telecom operators are increasingly venturing into media content and delivery,\" said Rajib Datta, partner, ISG Consumer Services. \"This evolution is creating substantial opportunities for the IT and outsourcing industry, particularly in areas of digital transformation, cloud migration and AI implementation.\" The TME sector is increasingly characterized by strategic mergers to enhance competitive positioning amid declining TV viewership and rising streaming costs, the report says. Companies are divesting non-core assets to focus on profitability, leveraging partnerships for content distribution and exploring new revenue models such as gaming and interactive content. The rollout of 5G standalone networks and the rise of content super-aggregator platforms are reshaping service delivery models, the report says. Technology-oriented network service models with cloud and GenAI constructs enable carriers to personalize plans based on real-time network data and user behavior, leverage AI and ML for automatic service provisioning and troubleshooting and offer customers self-service capabilities to manage subscriptions or connectivity issues. The shift is taking place against a backdrop of new EU regulations with stricter requirements around content quotas, payments, data protection, anti-competition and algorithmic transparency. The report says European data residency requirements and cultural alignment needs are driving growth in near-shore delivery centers. \"TME companies fighting for price-sensitive customers are leveraging AI, 5G and edge computing to offer a simple, all-in-one platform with a single bundle and subscription,\" said Jan Erik Aase, partner and global leader, ISG Provider Lens Research. \"Providers working with TME enterprises in EMEA should train leaders and employees on AI, centralize AI efforts to streamline decision-making and governance and create guidelines for environmentally responsible AI and robust data protection.\" Story Continues The report says service providers face emerging competition from cloud hyperscalers, specialized boutique providers and clients\u2019 internal capability-building initiatives. Talent shortages are challenging their ability to acquire the specialized skills needed to deliver 5G deployment, edge computing and content platform development services.

Industry: ISG Business Wire Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 12:00 PM 5 min read In This Article: III +7.52% ISG Provider Lens\u2122 report says AI-powered tools can tackle insurance industry challenges LONDON, January 27, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--An unpredictable global environment and advancing AI and intelligent technologies are driving fundamental shifts in the risk landscape and insurers\u2019 relationships with clients and regulators in Europe, says a new research report from Information Services Group ( ISG ) (Nasdaq: III ), a leading global technology research and advisory firm. The 2024 ISG Provider Lens\u2122 Insurance Services report for Europe says new AI-powered tools can tackle existing and emerging challenges across the insurance value chain. Enterprises are increasingly adopting solutions to streamline their operations, enhance service delivery and ensure compliance with new regulations. \"The residual effects of COVID-19 and the ongoing global climate crisis are contributing to a rapidly evolving risk landscape and disrupting well-established actuarial models,\" said Thorsten St\u00fcwe, EMEA director, ISG Insurance. \"The economic impacts of these forces are also affecting how much consumers and businesses can spend on insurance products. Insurance providers are now beginning to assess the strategy shifts these forces will effect.\" The report says AI has evolved from a speculative concept into a transformative force in insurance, with applications such as data-driven agent profiling, predictive health analytics and advanced fraud detection techniques. Service providers are offering more specialized solutions to meet the evolving demand for personalization and integrating advanced technologies such as AI/ML to improve claims processing, policy administration and customer service. For the European market, service providers are focusing on more data-driven decision-making and predictive analytics services and helping insurance firms transform their business process outsourcing into digitized operations to improve customer experience throughout the insurance service lifecycle. While managed services and application data management remain significant components of insurance enterprise IT budgets, the ISG research says IT outsourcing providers are expanding their portfolios into system integration, IT advisory services and business consulting and leveraging cutting-edge digital technologies, including conversational AI, to improve customer engagement. \"Customer experience and innovation have emerged as key competitive differentiators in the insurance industry,\" said Jan Erik Aase, partner and global leader, ISG Provider Lens Research. \"Strategic provider partners can create immense value by delivering next-generation technologies, innovative business processes and insurance domain capabilities that enable cost-effective and sustainable growth.\" Story Continues The report also explores the need for insurance leaders to comprehensively evaluate their current organizational posture. To effectively leverage AI\u2019s vast potential, insurers should establish scalable AI infrastructures, encourage collaboration between data science and actuarial teams and uphold a culture of continuous innovation.
