[{"text": "LIVE The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs Jim Cramer on Arbutus Biopharma Corporation (ABUS): \u2018It Loses Money\u2019 Syeda Seirut Javed Thu, Jan 16, 2025, 7:22 PM 4 min read In This Article: ABUS -1.50% We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Lightning Round: 7 Stocks Under the Spotlight . In this article, we are going to take a look at where \u00a0Arbutus Biopharma Corporation (NASDAQ:ABUS) stands against the other stocks featured in Jim Cramer's Lightning Round. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, offered his insights into the market's recent performance, highlighting why the tech-heavy Nasdaq failed to make a strong rebound. He pointed to a unique combination of factors contributing to the setback: the influence of the U.S. government and the actions of Mark Zuckerberg. Cramer drew a parallel between the tech sector and the pharmaceutical industry, which similarly faces increasing scrutiny and restrictions from federal authorities. After attending the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, Cramer expressed his optimism about the future of medicine. Despite the promising developments in the healthcare space, he pointed out that the U.S. government doesn't appear to be particularly favorable toward executives in the industry, who are investing heavily in research and development. He noted that while these companies are spending billions on R&D, they still find themselves under fire, with the Biden administration targeting major drugs as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. \u201cWe are in some weird moment where the two best industries we have are in the crosshairs of the federal government with Mark Zuckerberg aiding and abetting the prosecution. The drug companies managed to rally today because we heard their side of the story. But tech, the tag team of the government and Meta may have been too much for everyone. At the end of the day though, buyers finally came in to find bargains in the semis and software and the drug stocks, only the drug stocks finished in the green.\u201d READ ALSO Jim Cramer is Watching These 8 Stocks and Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan: 12 Stocks in Focus This Week \u201cAt the same time, I sure didn't like what I saw when I watched the Joe Rogan Experience this weekend when a very unfettered Mark Zuckerberg... took some shots, I would say cheap shots, I mean just terrible, at Apple that made me want to throw a yellow flag 15 yards on sportsmanlike conduct.\u201d What bothered Cramer even more, however, was the U.S. government's increasing intervention in the semiconductor industry, which he felt undermined the efforts of experts like Jensen Huang. Over the weekend, new restrictions were put in place that limited the number of GPUs companies could sell, further complicating the situation for the tech sector. Story Continues \u201cThe bottom line: Are the charges against these two industries just glancing blows? Nah, this was just one day where the bond market didn\u2019t crush every stock.\u201d Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 7 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the recent episode of Mad Money on January 13.

Therapeutics (KYMR) Moves 7.8% Higher: Will This Strength Last? Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 5:38 PM 2 min read In This Article: KYMR -2.78% ABUS -1.50% Kymera Therapeutics, Inc . KYMR shares rallied 7.8% in the last trading session to close at $40.12. This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 13.6% loss over the past four weeks. Shares gained as investors were impressed by the pipeline updates provided by the company at the J.P. Morgan Annual Healthcare Conference. Kymera has a sound cash position and ended 2024 with an estimated cash of $850 million, which should extend its runway to mid-2027. This company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.76 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -204%. Revenues are expected to be $13.09 million, down 72.7% from the year-ago quarter. Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements. For Kymera Therapeutics, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions. So, make sure to keep an eye on KYMR going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"LIVE The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs Arbutus Provides 2025 Corporate and Financial Update Arbutus Biopharma Corporation Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 3:30 PM 10 min read In This Article: ABUS -1.50% Arbutus Biopharma Corporation Initiating Phase 2b clinical trial in first half of 2025 after achieving a meaningful functional cure rate in cHBV patients treated with imdusiran and interferon WARMINSTER, Pa., Jan. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Arbutus Biopharma Corporation (Nasdaq: ABUS) (\u201cArbutus\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company leveraging its extensive virology expertise to develop a functional cure for people with chronic hepatitis B virus (cHBV) infection, today announced its 2025 corporate objectives and provided a financial update. \u201cWe enter 2025 with solid financial footing and strong momentum in achieving our mission of developing a functional cure for cHBV, a disease that affects more than 250 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of liver cancer,\u201d said Michael J. McElhaugh, Interim President and Chief Executive Officer of Arbutus. \u201cThe data we reported late last year from our IM-PROVE I Phase 2a clinical trial showed a meaningful functional cure rate and immune activation in cHBV patients that were treated with our RNAi therapeutic, imdusiran, interferon and nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) therapy. These data support our belief that imdusiran is differentiated from other RNAi therapeutics in development for HBV. Therefore, we plan to initiate a Phase 2b clinical trial combining imdusiran, interferon and NA therapy in the first half of 2025.\u201d Imdusiran (RNAi therapeutic) At the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) \u2013 The Liver Meeting \u00ae in November 2024, the Company presented new data from its IM-PROVE I Phase 2a clinical trial showing that six doses of imdusiran and 24 weeks of pegylated interferon alfa-2\u03b1 (IFN), a standard-of-care immunomodulator, added to ongoing NA therapy led to a functional cure rate of 50% (3/6) in HBeAg-negative patients with baseline HBsAg levels less than 1000 IU/mL, and an overall functional cure rate of 25% (3/12). Those patients that achieved a functional cure also seroconverted with high anti-HBs antibody levels. The combination of imdusiran, IFN and NA therapy was generally safe and well-tolerated. Based on this data, the Company is planning to initiate a placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial with this treatment regimen in the first half of 2025. Subject to regulatory approval, the clinical trial is anticipated to enroll approximately 170 HBeAg-negative cHBV patients with baseline HBsAg \u22641000 IU/mL. Additional details will be provided by the Company after regulatory approval. The Company also presented data from its IM-PROVE II Phase 2a clinical trial showing that the addition of low dose nivolumab increased rates of HBsAg loss in cHBV patients that were first treated with imdusiran, ongoing NA therapy and Barinthus Biotherapeutics\u2019 VTP-300. In this clinical trial, 23% (3/13) of patients that received imdusiran, VTP-300, NA therapy and nivolumab achieved HBsAg loss by week 48. The Company is evaluating functional cure in these patients and anticipates reporting data in the first half of 2025. Story Continues AB-101 (oral PD-L1 inhibitor) AB-101-001 is a Phase 1a/1b double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of single- and multiple-ascending doses of AB-101, the Company\u2019s oral PD-L1 inhibitor, in healthy subjects and patients with cHBV. Based on data from Part 2 of this clinical trial reported in November 2024 showing that AB-101 was generally well-tolerated with evidence of dose-dependent receptor occupancy, Arbutus has moved into Part 3 which evaluates repeat doses of AB-101 for 28 days in patients with cHBV. Data from the 10 mg cohort is expected in the first half of 2025. Next steps for AB-101 will be determined after Arbutus evaluates data from Part 3 of this clinical trial. LNP Litigation Arbutus will continue to protect and defend its intellectual property, which is the subject of the on-going lawsuits against Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech. The Company is seeking fair compensation for Moderna\u2019s and Pfizer/BioNTech\u2019s use of its patented LNP technology that was developed with great effort and at a great expense, without which Moderna\u2019s and Pfizer/BioNTech\u2019s COVID-19 vaccines would not have been successful. The claim construction hearing for the lawsuit against Pfizer/BioNTech occurred on December 18, 2024. The court is expected to provide its ruling on the claim construction and issue the scheduling order in the first half of 2025. The Moderna trial date is scheduled for September 24, 2025, and is subject to the court\u2019s availability. Expert reports and expert depositions continue in this lawsuit. Financial Update: The Company had cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities totaling approximately $123 million as of December 31, 2024 (unaudited). The Company expects to significantly reduce its net cash burn in 2025 when compared to 2024. Net cash burn is expected to range from $47 to $50 million in 2025 versus a 2024 net cash burn of approximately $65 million (unaudited). The Company believes its cash, cash equivalents, investments in marketable securities and anticipated contractual milestones from Qilu Pharmaceutical, its strategic partner in Greater China, are sufficient to fund its operations through the first quarter of 2028. This includes fully funding the imdusiran Phase 2b clinical trial. The preliminary cash, cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2024 and the estimated 2024 net cash burn were calculated prior to the completion of an audit by Arbutus\u2019 independent registered public accounting firm and are therefore subject to adjustment. With its current cash balance and anticipated 2025 net cash burn, the Company does not anticipate utilizing its \u201cat-the-market\u201d program (ATM) this year. About Imdusiran Imdusiran is an RNAi therapeutic specifically designed to reduce all HBV viral proteins and antigens including hepatitis B surface antigen, which is thought to be a key prerequisite to enable reawakening of a patient\u2019s immune system to respond to the virus. Imdusiran targets hepatocytes using Arbutus\u2019 novel covalently conjugated N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) delivery technology enabling subcutaneous delivery. In a Phase 2a clinical trial, imdusiran achieved meaningful functional cure rates in patients with cHBV when combined with pegylated interferon (IFN) alfa-2\u03b1 and nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) therapy. Clinical data generated thus far has shown imdusiran to be generally safe and well-tolerated, while also providing meaningful reductions in hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B DNA. In the first half of 2025, the Company is planning to initiate a Phase 2b clinical trial of imdusiran combined with IFN and NA therapy. About AB-101 AB-101 is our oral PD-L1 inhibitor candidate that we believe will allow for controlled checkpoint blockade while minimizing the systemic safety issues typically seen with checkpoint antibody therapies. Immune checkpoints such as PD-1/PD-L1 play an important role in the induction and maintenance of immune tolerance and in T-cell activation. Preclinical data generated thus far indicates that AB-101 mediates re-activation of exhausted HBV-specific T-cells from cHBV patients. We believe AB-101, when used in combination with other approved and investigational agents, could potentially lead to a functional cure in patients chronically infected with HBV. AB-101 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1a/1b clinical trial. About HBV Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV can cause chronic infection which leads to a higher risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer. Chronic HBV infection represents a significant unmet medical need. The World Health Organization estimates that over 250 million people worldwide suffer from chronic HBV infection, while other estimates indicate that approximately 2 million people in the United States suffer from chronic HBV infection. Approximately 1.1 million people die every year from complications related to chronic HBV infection despite the availability of effective vaccines and current treatment options. About Arbutus Arbutus Biopharma Corporation (Nasdaq: ABUS) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company leveraging its extensive virology expertise to develop novel therapeutics with distinct mechanisms of action, which can potentially be combined to provide a functional cure for patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (cHBV). Arbutus believes the key to success in developing a functional cure involves suppressing HBV DNA, reducing surface antigen, and boosting HBV-specific immune responses. Arbutus\u2019 pipeline of internally developed, proprietary compounds includes an RNAi therapeutic, imdusiran (AB-729), and an oral PD-L1 inhibitor, AB-101. Imdusiran has achieved meaningful functional cure rates in patients with cHBV when administered as combination therapy. In the first half of 2025, Arbutus is planning to initiate a Phase 2b clinical trial with imdusiran. AB-101 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1a/1b clinical trial.

min read In This Article: ABUS -1.50% SPRO -6.27% Arbutus Biopharma (ABUS) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.10 per share in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This compares to loss of $0.12 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. A quarter ago, it was expected that this biopharmaceutical company would post a loss of $0.10 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.11, delivering a surprise of -10%. Over the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates. Arbutus , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, posted revenues of $1.34 million for the quarter ended September 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22.82%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.66 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Arbutus shares have added about 58.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 21.2%. What's Next for Arbutus? While Arbutus has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Arbutus: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.09 on $1.76 million in revenues for the coming quarter and -$0.38 on $7.35 million in revenues for the current fiscal year. Story Continues Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

Net Proceeds from Common Shares: Approximately $44 million received in the first half of 2024. Cash Used in Operations: $54.5 million during the first half of 2024. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with ABUS. Release Date: November 06, 2024 For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript . Positive Points Arbutus Biopharma Corp ( NASDAQ:ABUS ) presented promising data from their phase two clinical trials, showing significant surface antigen loss in patients with chronic hepatitis B. The company has a strong financial position with approximately $131 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, providing a cash runway into the fourth quarter of 2026. ABUS's ongoing litigation with Moderna and Pfizer Biontech regarding LNP intellectual property is progressing, with trial dates set for 2025. The company's AB-101 oral small molecule PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor showed favorable safety profiles and evidence of receptor occupancy in early trials. Arbutus Biopharma Corp ( NASDAQ:ABUS ) is actively pursuing a functional cure for chronic hepatitis B, which could significantly reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes. Negative Points The data from ongoing phase two trials are under embargo, limiting the ability to provide updates at this time. The company's current treatments for chronic hepatitis B have a low functional cure rate, necessitating the development of new therapies. Arbutus Biopharma Corp ( NASDAQ:ABUS ) reported a cash burn of $54.5 million in operations during the first half of 2024. The litigation process with Moderna and Pfizer Biontech is expected to be lengthy, with trial dates not set until late 2024 and 2025. The company's phase one trials for AB-101 are still in early stages, with preliminary data from hepatitis B patients expected only in the first half of next year. Q & A Highlights Q : What are your expectations for the functional cure data in the upcoming cohort A2 without inducer? A : Michael McElhaugh, Interim President and CEO, explained that they have not presented any functional cure data related to inducer yet. The 20% functional cure rate is a baseline goal for the company, as current therapies achieve less than 10%. The aim is to reach a meaningful functional cure rate of 20% or more, which would be beneficial to patients. Karen Sims, Chief Medical Officer, clarified that all subjects in the improved one study received at least four doses of inducer before being randomized to different interferon-containing cohorts. Story Continues Q : How are you considering the denominator for functional cure in cohort A1? A : Karen Sims, Chief Medical Officer, stated that they would consider the entire cohort of around 12 or 13 subjects for functional cure analysis. They have already presented surface antigen loss data, showing 33% loss in the entire cohort and 67% in those with baseline surface antigen less than 1,000. These results are above the 20% bar for functional cure. Q : What are the expectations for the AB 101 trial results in the first half of next year? A : Michael McElhaugh, Interim President and CEO, mentioned that they are still working through the details and cannot specify the exact data set to be presented. However, there will be HBV patient data included. They plan to find the right forum to present the multiple ascending dose data from healthy subjects. Q : Can you provide any clarity on the timing for the phase 2B trial? A : Michael McElhaugh, Interim President and CEO, stated that they are diligently working through the process and need to have internal discussions and talk to regulators. The goal is to advance inducer into a phase 2B trial as quickly as possible, but no specific timing can be provided at this point. Q : What can be expected after the claim construction hearing in the lawsuit against Pfizer? A : Michael McElhaugh, Interim President and CEO, explained that after the Markman hearing, they will await the court's schedule, which will provide insight into the trial date and subsequent proceedings. The outcome of the hearing will take a couple of months to be reported, and they are eagerly awaiting the results.

for Arbutus to Pursue a License and Collaboration Agreement With a Strategic Partner and Explore All Options for HBV Portfolio Urges Arbutus to Commit to No Dilutive Equity Issuances or ATM Use for Another Year Whitefort Formally Requests Meeting With the Board to Ensure Alignment of Views on Path Forward NEW YORK, December 03, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Whitefort Capital Management, LP (together with its affiliates, \"Whitefort Capital,\" \"us\" or \"we\"), which is a long-term investor and the third largest shareholder of Arbutus Biopharma Corp. (NASDAQ: ABUS) (\"Arbutus\" or the \"Company\") with an ownership interest of approximately 6.8% of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares, today published a letter to the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (the \"Board\") outlining its views on the actions Arbutus must take in order to preserve and maximize shareholder value. The full text of the letter is below: Arbutus Biopharma Corporation 701 Veterans Circle Warminster, PA 18974 Attn: Board of Directors Re: Company\u2019s Direction Following Announcement of a Functional Cure for Hepatitis B (HBV) Dear Members of the Board, Whitefort Capital Management, LP (together with its affiliates, \"Whitefort Capital\" or \"we\") is a significant shareholder of Arbutus Biopharma Corporation (\"Arbutus\" or the \"Company\") with ownership of approximately 6.8% of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares. In our public letter to fellow shareholders dated May 17, 2024, and reiterated in our private letter to the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (the \"Board\") dated July 16, 2024, we expressed our view that, provided the data from the Company\u2019s IM-PROVE I Phase 2a clinical trial remained confirmatory, the Company would be well positioned to pursue a license and collaboration agreement with a strategic partner and should explore all strategic options for its HBV portfolio at that time. Following the confirmatory results presented by the Company at AASLD \u2013 The Liver Meeting\u00ae on November 18, 2024 (pre-announced to the market on November 15), which reported that in Cohort A1 of the IM-PROVE I trial, 50% of patients who had baseline HBsAg levels less than 1000 IU/mL and 25% of patients overall achieved functional cure, we believe that time has now come. It is noteworthy that the Company\u2019s share price did not react positively to the announcement of the trial results on November 15, 2024, and was down over 5% in the following days. We previously expressed our view that Phase 2b and Phase 3 trials for a combination therapy enrolling many additional patients will be large, expensive and complicated such that to maximize the probability of success of its HBV program, the Company should partner with a larger biopharmaceutical company with an existing hepatitis franchise that has the clinical expertise, commercial infrastructure and capital necessary to commercialize a complex combination therapy. We believe that the market\u2019s negative, or at best muted, reaction to the positive data from the IM-PROVE I trial reflects investors\u2019 concerns over a possible self-funding of the Phase 2b trial, resulting in further shareholder dilution. While the Company may have sufficient cash to fund substantially all of Phase 2b, with cash balances affording it runway to the end of 2026, we reiterate our view that the Board must avoid further diluting shareholders and should clearly communicate to the market that it will not pursue further dilution by self-funding a Phase 2b trial. Story Continues To the extent the Board has any doubt as to what the Company\u2019s shareholders want, we would encourage you to review the stock performance on November 7, 2024, the day immediately after the Company filed its shelf registration statement for up to $300 million, including a prospectus supplement for up to $100 million common shares pursuant to an at-the-market (ATM) offering, incremental to the approximately $25 million remaining availability under the Company\u2019s existing ATM program. That day alone the Company\u2019s stock was down 5%, and since that announcement, the Company\u2019s share price has declined over 10% despite the positive IM-PROVE I trial data. Since the prior shelf registration statement would have expired on November 18, 2024, the $300 million shelf seems like reasonable housekeeping, but the $100 million ATM prospectus supplement rubbed salt in an unhealed wound. Arbutus shareholders freshly recollect that the number of shares outstanding increased by more than 3.4 times since 2018. While we were encouraged to hear Interim CEO Michael McElhaugh\u2019s public statement at an investor conference in May 2024 that, given the Company\u2019s substantial cash balance and sufficient liquidity, the Company does not \"anticipate the need to further utilize the ATM this year,\" it is now necessary to extend this commitment for another year, particularly given the importance of preserving the value of the Company\u2019s lipid nanoparticle (LNP) patent estate. We continue to believe that Arbutus\u2019 economic stake in the patent infringement claims against Moderna, Inc. (\"Moderna\") and Pfizer Inc. (\"Pfizer\")/BioNTech SE (\"BioNTech\") potentially represents significant value worth multiples of the Company\u2019s current market capitalization. We await the upcoming Pfizer/BioNTech claim construction hearing on December 18, 2024 with great interest. The Company should publicly commit to preserving the value of its LNP patent estate by avoiding any further share dilution. Furthermore, as the Company evaluates internally and engages regulator feedback on the Phase 2b trial design, now is the time to engage with potential strategic partners. Indeed, at the recent Jefferies London Healthcare Conference, Mr. McElhaugh commented that with \"functional cure rates to meaningful numbers, which we have now\u2026 there are plenty of [pharma] players out there who may become interested in the [HBV] space.\" We look forward to the Company engaging now and over the next few quarters in strategic partnership discussions regarding its HBV program and urge the Company to make a public announcement committing to no dilutive equity issuances or ATM use for another year. Additionally, we hereby formally request a meeting with the full Board in the coming weeks to ensure that there is full alignment of views regarding the path forward for the Company.

VTP-300 and low-dose nivolumab reached HBsAg loss by Week 48 WARMINSTER, Pa. and OXFORD, United Kingdom, Nov. 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Arbutus Biopharma Corporation (Nasdaq: ABUS), (\u201cArbutus\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company leveraging its extensive virology expertise to develop a functional cure for people with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, and Barinthus Biotherapeutics plc (NASDAQ: BRNS), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel immunotherapeutic candidates that guide T cells to control disease, today announced new preliminary data from the Phase 2a IM-PROVE II clinical trial (AB-729-202) of people with chronic hepatitis B virus (cHBV) at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) \u2013 The Liver Meeting \u00ae 2024. The new data are from an additional cohort of participants (Group C) who received repeat doses of imdusiran, Arbutus\u2019 RNAi therapeutic, followed by Barinthus Bio's T-cell stimulating immunotherapeutic, VTP-300, with or without low-dose nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody. The data indicated that Group C participants receiving nivolumab experienced increased rates of HBsAg loss (defined as HBsAg <LLOQ [0.05 IU/mL]) compared to Group A and B participants who received imdusiran and VTP-300 or placebo. The data from Groups A and B were previously presented at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) Congress in June 2024. Group C enrolled a total of 22 non-cirrhotic, virally suppressed cHBV participants with HBsAg \u2265100 to <5,000 IU/mL at screening who were on stable nucleos(t)ide analogue (NUC) therapy for \u226512 months. Thirteen of these participants were eligible to receive low-dose nivolumab and nine participants were not eligible, based on the trial criteria. The preliminary data from Group C included data to Week 48 (20/22 participants) and showed the following: Imdusiran lead-in treatment led to a mean decline from baseline in HBsAg consistent with data from Groups A and B. Significantly greater mean declines in HBsAg levels (p <0.017) were seen in Group C participants who received imdusiran and VTP-300 with nivolumab, at Week 48 compared with Groups A and B and Group C without nivolumab. 23% of participants (3/13) in the group receiving imdusiran, VTP-300 and low-dose nivolumab achieved HBsAg loss by Week 48. Increases in soluble immune biomarkers associated with immune checkpoint proteins, inflammation, and T-cell activation were observed in participants who had HBsAg loss at any point through Week 48. The Group C treatment regimen with nivolumab was generally well tolerated and did not result in any immune-related adverse events. Story Continues \u201cThese data demonstrated the impact of the combination of an immune stimulant such as VTP-300 and a low dose of the checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab in helping participants reach HBsAg loss,\u201d said Dr. Leon Hooftman, Chief Medical Officer of Barinthus Bio. \u201cWhile these are early data, the imdusiran, VTP-300 and low-dose nivolumab regimen is promising and is consistent with the data we are seeing from our HBV003 trial of VTP-300 plus low-dose nivolumab.\u201d \u201cThese data continue to support our belief that lowering surface antigen is key to promoting HBV-specific immune reawakening,\u201d commented Dr. Karen Sims, Chief Medical Officer of Arbutus Biopharma. \u201cIn this trial, imdusiran provided meaningful reductions in HBsAg prior to treatment with the immunomodulatory agents VTP-300 and low dose nivolumab, leading to improved response rates with this combination.\u201d The poster from the presentation at AASLD 2024 can be accessed through the Arbutus website under Publications . IM-PROVE II Trial Details The IM-PROVE II Phase 2a clinical trial initially enrolled 40 non-cirrhotic, virally suppressed cHBV participants that were on stable NUC therapy in Groups A and B. These participants received imdusiran (60mg every 8 weeks) for 24 weeks with on-going NUC therapy and were then randomized to receive either VTP-300 (Group A) or placebo (Group B) at Weeks 26 and 30 (and conditionally at Week 38 if they experienced a >0.5 log10\u00a0decline in HBsAg between Weeks 26 and 34). This trial was amended to include an additional cohort (Group C) which enrolled 22 participants, 13 of which were eligible to receive imdusiran (60mg every 8 weeks) for 24 weeks with ongoing NUC therapy followed by VTP-300 at Weeks 26 and 30 plus up to two low doses of nivolumab (0.3 mg/kg), an approved PD-1 monoclonal antibody at Week 30. The remaining 9 participants received the imdusiran/NUC/VTP-300 regimen without nivolumab. Participants could receive a second dose of VTP-300 \u00b1 low-dose nivolumab at Week 38 if their HBsAg was \u226510 IU/mL at Week 34. Upon completion of the treatment period at Week 48, all participants who met certain criteria could discontinue NUC therapy and be followed for an additional 48 weeks. Those who did not meet the criteria continued on NUC therapy for an additional 24 weeks of follow-up. About Imdusiran (AB-729) Imdusiran is an RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic specifically designed to reduce all HBV viral proteins and antigens including hepatitis B surface antigen, which is thought to be a key prerequisite to enable reawakening of a patient\u2019s immune system to respond to the virus. Imdusiran targets hepatocytes using Arbutus\u2019 novel covalently conjugated N -Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) delivery technology enabling subcutaneous delivery. Clinical data generated thus far has shown single and multiple doses of imdusiran to be generally safe and well-tolerated, while also providing meaningful reductions in hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B DNA. Imdusiran is currently in multiple Phase 2a clinical trials. About VTP-300 VTP-300 is an immunotherapeutic candidate consisting of an initial dose using the ChAdOx vector and a secondary dose(s) using the MVA vector, both encoding multiple HBsAg, including full-length surface, modified polymerase, and core antigens. VTP-300 is the first antigen-specific immunotherapy that has been shown to induce sustained reductions in HBsAg. Barinthus Bio is studying VTP-300 in combination with other agents, including siRNA and low-dose anti-PD-1 antibodies, to control the infection, and counterbalance the immune suppression and T cell exhaustion in the liver caused by chronic HBV infection. About Arbutus Arbutus Biopharma Corporation (Nasdaq: ABUS) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company leveraging its extensive virology expertise to develop novel therapeutics with distinct mechanisms of action, which can potentially be combined to provide a functional cure for patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (cHBV).

Exposing Animal Abuse at Italian Pig Farms, Files Legal Complaint, Addresses Industry Rebuttals PR Newswire Tue, Dec 17, 2024, 9:05 PM 2 min read LOS ANGELES , Dec. 17, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -\u00a0Last Chance for Animals (LCA) is continuing its efforts to expose the inhumane conditions endured by pigs on farms supplying Prosciutto di Parma by releasing a follow-up video after receiving widespread attention from its investigation released on December 5, 2024 . The findings of the undercover footage taken between April and November 2024 have caused a stir in the pig farming industry, exposing animal cruelty at farms run by Elio Martinelli , President of Assosuini, the Italian Pig Farmers Association. Despite the undeniable evidence of animal abuse, industry representatives are downplaying the severity of the situation. A pig seen at an Italian pig farm. (CNW Group/Last Chance For Animals) In response to LCA's report, Assosuini released a statement condemning the investigation, dismissing it as \"animal rights propaganda\" and claiming the footage was \"edited\" and outdated. LCA has countered these claims by providing irrefutable proof that the footage was filmed recently and verified with GPS data and dated newspaper clippings, leaving no room for doubt regarding the authenticity of the investigation. Additionally, the Consortium of Prosciutto di Parma attempted to distance itself from the farms in question, asserting that these farms do not directly produce Prosciutto di Parma. However, LCA's investigation clearly documented the presence of specific identifying \"Parma Ham\" tattoos on the pigs, which directly ties these farms to the production of Prosciutto di Parma. In light of these industry rebuttals, LCA's advocacy efforts have grown even stronger. The organization filed a legal complaint with the Public Prosecutor's Office at the Court of Mantua citing violations of Italian criminal and administrative laws. The complaint specifically addresses the deplorable living conditions and widespread cruelty uncovered at these farms, further intensifying LCA's legal action and commitment to ensuring justice for the animals involved. \"The footage speaks for itself\u2014there is no escaping the truth of the horrific conditions that these pigs are subjected to,\" said Chris DeRose , President and Founder of LCA. LCA continues to call on retailers to immediately stop selling Prosciutto di Parma products. \"Consumers deserve to know the truth about where their food comes from and the suffering it entails,\" added\u00a0DeRose. ABOUT LAST CHANCE FOR ANIMALS: LCA is an international non-profit organization dedicated to eliminating animal exploitation through education, investigations, legislation, and public awareness campaigns.
