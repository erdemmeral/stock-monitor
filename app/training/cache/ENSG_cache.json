[{"text": "Ensign Group (ENSG) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why Zacks Equity Research Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 8:45 PM 3 min read In This Article: ENSG +1.98% Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock. That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss. However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects. Ensign Group (ENSG) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank. Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this provider of nursing and rehabilitative care services a great growth pick right now. Earnings Growth Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration. While the historical EPS growth rate for Ensign Group is 17.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 10.9% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 10.6%. Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio Asset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales. Right now, Ensign Group has an S/TA ratio of 0.94, which means that the company gets $0.94 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.9, it can be said that the company is more efficient. In addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Ensign Group looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 11% this year versus the industry average of 7.7%. Story Continues Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions Beyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Ensign Group. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.2% over the past month. Bottom Line While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Ensign Group a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. This combination positions Ensign Group well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.

to Your Portfolio Now Zacks Equity Research Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 7:43 PM 4 min read In This Article: ENSG +1.98% USPH -0.63% The Ensign Group, Inc. ENSG is well-poised to grow due to the rising demand for healthcare services. Its moves to expand its geographic reach and increase market density, combined with improving occupancy,\u00a0will boost its results. ENSG stock has gained 2.2% over the past month, outperforming the industry and the S&P 500 Index.

Let's see what makes ENSGstock an attractive investment option at the moment.

This is depicted in the figure below. The Ensign Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise The Ensign Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise The Ensign Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | The Ensign Group, Inc. Quote ENSG\u2019s Attractive\u00a0Valuation & Rank The company\u2019s valuation looks relatively cheap compared with the industry average. Currently, Ensign is trading at 22.39X forward 12-month earnings, below the industry\u2019s average of 31.29X. ENSG also has a\u00a0Value Score\u00a0of B. Due to its solid prospects, Ensign currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). ENSG\u2019s Tailwinds Rising service and rental revenues are likely to support its top-line growth. Our estimate for service revenues for 2024 suggests almost 14% year-over-year growth, followed by more than 10% growth in 2025. The company\u2019s occupancy level and patient days are on the rise. We expect total facility occupancy levels to rise to 80.7% in 2024 and 83.8% in 2025 from the 2023 level of 78.5%. Actual patient days rose 9.4% in the first nine months of 2024, and the momentum is expected to continue in the coming days. Ensign has shown a strong track record of growth through strategic acquisitions, focusing on real estate and post-acute care operations. It acquires operations and transforms them into market leaders. It recently purchased the operations of eight skilled nursing facilities in Tennessee and one such facility in Alabama. Story Continues Its balance sheet strength is likely to continue supporting its acquisition efforts. Its long-term debt to capital of 7.5% compares favorably with the industry\u2019s average of 76.2%. A Risk However, there is a factor that investors should keep a careful eye on. Ensign\u2019s persistent increase in total expenses is affecting its margin growth. Our estimate for 2024 expenses suggests a 12.1% year-over-year increase, following a 27.3% jump in 2023. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive efficiency and growth in the long term.

IL \u2013 January 23, 2025 \u2013 Stocks in this week\u2019s article are \u2014 BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. BMRN, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Leidos Holdings, Inc. LDOS and The Ensign Group, Inc. ENSG. These Stocks Boast Impressive Interest Coverage Ratios Relying solely on stock price movements without understanding the company\u2019s fundamentals can cause investors to lose money. Investors must carefully review a company's financial health to make informed decisions, especially in today\u2019s unpredictable market. While sales and earnings are often the go-to metrics, they can sometimes be misleading and may not show whether a company has the financial strength to cover its obligations. This is where the coverage ratio holds the key \u2014 a higher ratio signals that a company is more capable of meeting its financial commitments. BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. , Amazon.com, Inc. , Leidos Holdings, Inc. and The Ensign Group, Inc. boast an impressive interest coverage ratio. Why Interest Coverage Ratio? The interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay interest charges on its debt. Debt, which is crucial to financing operations for the majority of companies, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company. The company\u2019s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, the interest coverage ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision. Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense. The interest coverage ratio suggests how many times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm has for paying interest. An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 suggests that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. One should also track the company\u2019s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over time. The Winning Strategy Apart from having an interest coverage ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results. Here are four of the 15 stocks that qualified the screening: BioMarin Pharmaceutical , a global biotechnology company, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and a VGM Score of A.

understanding the company\u2019s fundamentals can cause investors to lose money. Investors must carefully review a company's financial health to make informed decisions, especially in today\u2019s unpredictable market. While sales and earnings are often the go-to metrics, they can sometimes be misleading and may not show whether a company has the financial strength to cover its obligations. This is where the coverage ratio holds the key \u2014 a higher ratio signals that a company is more capable of meeting its financial commitments. BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. BMRN, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Leidos Holdings, Inc. LDOS and The Ensign Group, Inc. ENSG boast an impressive interest coverage ratio. Why Interest Coverage Ratio? The interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay interest charges on its debt. Debt, which is crucial to financing operations for the majority of companies, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company. The company\u2019s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, the interest coverage ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision. Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense. The interest coverage ratio suggests how many times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm has for paying interest. An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 suggests that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. One should also track the company\u2019s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over time. The Winning Strategy Apart from having an interest coverage ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results. Interest coverage ratio greater than X-Industry Median Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher. 5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks with a strong EPS growth history. Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential. Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable. Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.

Mashaid Ahmed Sun, Jan 19, 2025, 1:38 AM 6 min read In This Article: ^RUT -1.28% ENSG +1.98% We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Russell 2000 Stocks to Invest in According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Ensign Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: ENSG ) stands against other best Russell 2000 stocks to invest in according to analysts. The Russell 2000 Index is a widely followed benchmark that tracks the performance of small-cap companies in the United States. This index includes the smallest 2,000 companies, ranging from a few hundred million to a few billion dollars in market capitalization. These companies are often seen as more growth-oriented and can be more volatile compared to their large-cap counterparts. Investors and analysts use the performance of the Russell 2000 Index to gauge the health and trends of the small-cap segment of the U.S. equity market, which can provide insights into broader economic conditions and investor sentiment toward smaller, potentially higher-growth companies. The Russell 2000 Index has demonstrated significant strength over the past years. As of January 17, the index stands at 2,278.01, with a 19.07% increase over the past year and a remarkable 34.03% increase over the past five years. This robust growth reflects the resilience and potential of small-cap companies in the United States and highlights the strong investor sentiment and economic conditions that have favored small-cap stocks.

In an interview with CNBC on January 17, Chris Retzler, Portfolio Manager of Small Cap Growth Fund at Needham Asset Management, discussed the current state and future prospects of small-cap stocks in the US market. Retzler acknowledged that while small-cap stocks, as represented by the Russell 2000 Index, have struggled compared to larger indices such as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, there are signs of improvement, as the Russell 2000 has managed to break out of correction territory for four consecutive days, which is a positive signal. Retzler emphasized that small-cap companies are looking for certainty in the U.S. economy, which is poised to have at some point in a few weeks or months. Once this certainty is established, Retzler expects to see an acceleration in market activity, driven by increased confidence and broader market participation. He highlighted the significant innovation occurring in sectors such as electric vehicles, semiconductors, and new materials, which could provide opportunities for small-cap companies to thrive. Retzler mentioned that infrastructure is also another key area of focus. He cited data centers and power supply as critical areas where infrastructure gaps are evident. The push for bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. is also creating a demand for more robust infrastructure to support these industries. Story Continues The discussion also touched on the challenges and opportunities presented by higher interest rates and the Federal Reserve\u2019s pause in rate hikes. Retzler noted that while interest rates are higher, the yield curve is becoming healthier, with favorable conditions for lending, particularly through regional banks. Retzler acknowledged that lower interest rates would definitely benefit small-cap companies, however, the long-term bond rates are still relatively high, and there is a need to address the deficit spending and demand in the bond market before bringing interest rates down further. Retzler emphasized the importance of a business-friendly regulatory environment, which includes tax incentives and deregulation. He noted that small-cap companies have often been overburdened by regulatory requirements, and any move toward deregulation could significantly benefit these firms. Tax incentives, in particular, can play a crucial role in encouraging companies to bring their manufacturing operations back to the U.S., which can lead to job creation and economic growth. Additionally, tax incentives can help reduce the cost of doing business, making it easier for small-cap companies to compete and expand. He also suggested that if the regulatory environment becomes more business-friendly, including potential deregulation, it could lead to more mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and a healthier IPO market. The current economic conditions are becoming favorable for small-cap companies, with improvements in the economy, declining interest rates, and the potential for deregulation. These factors should benefit small-cap stocks and support their future growth. Why The Ensign Group, Inc. (ENSG) Is One of the Best Russell 2000 Stocks to Invest in According to Analysts?
