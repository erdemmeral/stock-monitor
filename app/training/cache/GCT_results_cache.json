DXPE, Photronics, Inc. PLAB, GigaCloud Technology Inc. GCT and Mission Produce, Inc. AVO. Look Beyond Profit: Bet on 4 Stocks with Increasing Cash Flows Crunching profit numbers and evaluating surprises might appear as a good option in the ongoing reporting cycle but these do not ensure that the profits are being efficiently channeled to the reserves for funding growth. This is because even a profit-making company can have a deficiency of cash flow and go bankrupt while meeting its obligations. Therefore, one must look at a company's proficiency in generating cash flows before investing in the right stocks. This is because cash is the most indispensable factor for any company. It gives strength and vitality and is the key to its existence, development and success. This view is particularly relevant in light of the ongoing global economic uncertainty, coupled with market disruptions and dislocations. In this regard, stocks like DXP Enterprises, Inc. , Photronics, Inc. , GigaCloud Technology Inc. and Mission Produce, Inc. are worth buying. To figure out this efficiency, one needs to consider a company's net cash flow. While in any business, cash moves in and out, it is net cash flow that explains how much money a company is actually generating. If a company is experiencing a positive cash flow, it denotes an increase in its liquid assets, which gives it the means to meet debt obligations, shell out for expenses, reinvest in the business, endure downturns and finally return wealth to shareholders. On the other hand, a negative cash flow indicates a decline in the company's liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves. However, having a positive cash flow merely does not secure a company's future growth. To ride on the growth curve, a company must have its cash flow increasing because that indicates management's efficiency in regulating its cash movements and less dependency on outside financing for running its business. Therefore, keep yourself abreast with the following screen to bet on stocks with rising cash flows. Here are four out of the 11 stocks that qualified for the screening: DXP Enterprises provides innovative pumping solutions, supply-chain services, and maintenance, repair, operating and production services.

editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 2:49 PM 5 min read In This Article: GCTS -6.48% GCTS-WS Key Insights Significant control over GCT Semiconductor Holding by individual investors implies that the general public has more power to influence management and governance-related decisions The top 25 shareholders own 42% of the company Ownership research, combined with past performance data can help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock To get a sense of who is truly in control of GCT Semiconductor Holding, Inc. ( NYSE:GCTS ), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that individual investors own the lion's share in the company with 57% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Meanwhile, public companies make up 17% of the company\u2019s shareholders. In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of GCT Semiconductor Holding. Check out our latest analysis for GCT Semiconductor Holding NYSE:GCTS Ownership Breakdown January 23rd 2025 What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About GCT Semiconductor Holding? Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. We can see that GCT Semiconductor Holding does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see GCT Semiconductor Holding's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. NYSE:GCTS Earnings and Revenue Growth January 23rd 2025 GCT Semiconductor Holding is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is Anapass, Inc., with ownership of 17%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 10% and 4.7%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There is a little analyst coverage of the stock, but not much. So there is room for it to gain more coverage. Story Continues Insider Ownership Of GCT Semiconductor Holding While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. We can report that insiders do own shares in GCT Semiconductor Holding, Inc.. As individuals, the insiders collectively own US$5.2m worth of the US$119m company. It is good to see some investment by insiders, but we usually like to see higher insider holdings. It might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public Ownership The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a substantial 57% stake in GCT Semiconductor Holding, suggesting it is a fairly popular stock. With this amount of ownership, retail investors can collectively play a role in decisions that affect shareholder returns, such as dividend policies and the appointment of directors. They can also exercise the power to vote on acquisitions or mergers that may not improve profitability. Private Equity Ownership With a stake of 10%, private equity firms could influence the GCT Semiconductor Holding board. Some might like this, because private equity are sometimes activists who hold management accountable. But other times, private equity is selling out, having taking the company public. Private Company Ownership We can see that Private Companies own 4.7%, of the shares on issue. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research. Public Company Ownership Public companies currently own 17% of GCT Semiconductor Holding stock. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.

Moumita C. Chattopadhyay Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 4:58 PM 5 min read In This Article: DXPE -3.10% Crunching profit numbers and evaluating surprises might appear as a good option in the ongoing reporting cycle but these do not ensure that the profits are being efficiently channeled to the reserves for funding growth. This is because even a profit-making company can have a deficiency of cash flow and go bankrupt while meeting its obligations. Therefore, one must look at a company\u2019s proficiency in generating cash flows before investing in the right stocks. This is because cash is the most indispensable factor for any company. It gives strength and vitality and is the key to its existence, development and success. This view is particularly relevant in light of the ongoing global economic uncertainty, coupled with market disruptions and dislocations. In this regard, stocks like DXP Enterprises, Inc. DXPE, Photronics, Inc. PLAB, GigaCloud Technology Inc. GCT and Mission Produce, Inc. AVO are worth buying. To figure out this efficiency, one needs to consider a company\u2019s net cash flow. While in any business, cash moves in and out, it is net cash flow that explains how much money a company is actually generating. If a company is experiencing a positive cash flow, it denotes an increase in its liquid assets, which gives it the means to meet debt obligations, shell out for expenses, reinvest in the business, endure downturns and finally return wealth to shareholders. On the other hand, a negative cash flow indicates a decline in the company\u2019s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves. However, having a positive cash flow merely does not secure a company\u2019s future growth. To ride on the growth curve, a company must have its cash flow increasing because that indicates management\u2019s efficiency in regulating its cash movements and less dependency on outside financing for running its business. Therefore, keep yourself abreast with the following screen to bet on stocks with rising cash flows. Screening Parameters: To find stocks that have seen increasing cash flow over time, we ran the screen for those whose cash flow in the latest reported quarter was at least equal to or greater than the 5-year average cash flow per common share . This implies a positive trend and increasing cash over a period of time. In addition to this, we chose: Zacks Rank 1: No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here . Average Broker Rating 1: This indicates that brokers are also highly hopeful about the company\u2019s future performance. Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This sieves out low-priced stocks. VGM Score of B or better: This score is also of great assistance in selecting stocks. Importantly, this scoring system helps in picking winning stocks in their industry categories. Here are four out of the 11 stocks that qualified for the screening: DXP Enterprises provides innovative pumping solutions, supply-chain services, and maintenance, repair, operating and production services.

(GCT): Here is What You Need to Know Zacks Equity Research Tue, Jan 21, 2025, 5:00 PM 5 min read In This Article: GCT -7.41% GigaCloud Technology Inc. (GCT) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term. Shares of this company have returned +9.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.2% change. The Zacks Technology Services industry, to which GigaCloud Technology Inc. belongs, has lost 1.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Revisions to Earnings Estimates Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings. We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. GigaCloud Technology Inc. is expected to post earnings of $0.90 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged. The consensus earnings estimate of $3.10 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +34.8%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.38 indicates a change of +9.2% from what GigaCloud Technology Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged. Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, GigaCloud Technology Inc. is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Story Continues The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: 12 Month EPS Projected Revenue Growth While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth. For GigaCloud Technology Inc. the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $290 million indicates a year-over-year change of +18.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $1.16 billion and $1.32 billion estimates indicate +64.1% and +14.3% changes, respectively. Last Reported Results and Surprise History GigaCloud Technology Inc. reported revenues of $303.32 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +70.2%. EPS of $0.98 for the same period compares with $0.59 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $279.4 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +8.56%. The EPS surprise was +46.27%. Over the last four quarters, GigaCloud Technology Inc. surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period. Valuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance. Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is. The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. GigaCloud Technology Inc. is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.

{"text": "4 Top-Ranked Stocks With Solid Net Profit Margins to Buy Now Anirudha Bhagat Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 4:10 PM 5 min read In This Article: GCT -7.41% CSTL +1.70% The primary purpose of a business is to generate profits that can be reinvested in expansion or utilized for rewarding shareholders. Net profit margin is an effective tool to measure the profits reaped by a business. A higher net margin underlines a company\u2019s efficiency in translating sales into actual profits. Moreover, this metric gives insight into how well a company is run and the headwinds weighing on it. Castle Biosciences, Inc. CSTL, OppFi, Inc. OPFI, GigaCloud Technology Inc. GCT and Qifu Technology, Inc. QFIN boast solid net profit margins. Net Profit Margin = Net profit/Sales * 100 In simple terms, net profit is the amount a company retains after deducting all costs, interest, depreciation, taxes and other expenses. In fact, net profit margin can turn out to be a potent point of reference to gauge the strength of a company\u2019s operations and its cost-control measures. Also, higher net profit is essential for rewarding stakeholders. Further, strength in the metric not only attracts investors but also draws well-skilled employees who eventually enhance the value of a business. Moreover, a higher net profit margin compared with its peers provides a company with a competitive edge. Pros and Cons Net profit margin helps investors gain clarity on a company\u2019s business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and manufacturing efficiency. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors. However, net profit margin, as an investment criterion, has its share of pitfalls. The metric varies widely from industry to industry. While net income is a key metric for investment measurement in traditional industries, it is not that important for technology companies. In addition, the difference in accounting treatment of various items \u2014 especially non-cash expenses like depreciation and stock-based compensation \u2014 makes comparison a daunting task. Furthermore, for companies preferring to grow with debt instead of equity funding, higher interest expenses usually weigh on net profit. In such cases, the measure is rendered ineffective while analyzing a company\u2019s performance. The Winning Strategy A healthy net profit margin and solid EPS growth are the two most sought-after elements in a business model. Apart from these, we have added a few criteria to ensure maximum returns from this strategy.

Inc. (NASDAQ:GCT) Stock Has Shown Weakness Lately But Financials Look Strong: Should Prospective Shareholders Make The Leap? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Mon, Jan 20, 2025, 3:30 PM 3 min read In This Article: GCT -7.41% GigaCloud Technology (NASDAQ:GCT) has had a rough three months with its share price down 26%. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company\u2019s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to GigaCloud Technology's ROE today. Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for GigaCloud Technology How Is ROE Calculated? The formula for ROE is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for GigaCloud Technology is: 33% = US$130m \u00f7 US$400m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024). The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.33 in profit. What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth? Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics. GigaCloud Technology's Earnings Growth And 33% ROE Firstly, we acknowledge that GigaCloud Technology has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 11% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. So, the substantial 68% net income growth seen by GigaCloud Technology over the past five years isn't overly surprising. We then compared GigaCloud Technology's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 13% in the same 5-year period. NasdaqGM:GCT Past Earnings Growth January 20th 2025 Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if GigaCloud Technology is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E , relative to its industry. Story Continues Is GigaCloud Technology Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits? GigaCloud Technology doesn't pay any regular dividends currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the high earnings growth number that we discussed above. Conclusion On the whole, we feel that GigaCloud Technology's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

"Why Are Analysts Bullish On GigaCloud Technology Inc. (GCT) Now? Talha Qureshi Sat, Jan 18, 2025, 8:33 PM 5 min read In This Article: GCT -7.41% We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Software Stocks to Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where GigaCloud Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:GCT) stands against the other software stocks. Software Industry Update According to the MCF Corporate Finance Q4 2024 software update report, software company valuations have reached unprecedented heights due to the AI boom, especially with innovations surrounding GenAI. Investors are increasingly viewing strong AI roadmaps as essential for revenue and margin expansion, leading to heightened interest in software companies that integrate advanced AI capabilities into their offerings. According to the report, software companies are trading at 6.2x the Current median EV / NTM revenue estimate. As highlighted by the report, another key reason for increased valuations has been the high adoption rate of GenAI. The enterprise-level usage of GenAI almost doubled year-over-year in 2024 and around 65% of the enterprises now use the technology. The report noted that organizations have now transitioned from the pilot testing phase to full-scale GenAI implementations, enhancing workflows and customer experiences while unlocking new revenue streams. Moreover, the investment and funding for GenAI-based software companies also increased sharply. According to the report GenAI raised around $56 billion in funding in 2024, driven by a $10 billion round of DataBricks, a $6.6 billion round by OpenAI, and a $4 billion round of Anthropic. Not only this, GenAI also claimed more than 40% of the total AI funding across the United States, Europe, and Israel. Talking about how AI has started to play in the favor of software, Jeff Richards, managing partner at Notable Capital appeared on a CNBC interview a month ago. He noted that AI is actively working for the software sector, indicating that the technology is not just a prospect but is already being utilized effectively in various applications within the industry. Richards highlighted that the development of AI which started with semiconductor chips, then moved to data centers and servers is now in the software development stage where software application companies are in high demand to integrate AI applications in various industries. Similar to the findings by the MCF corporate finance report, Richards also highlighted that venture capital funds have been heavily funding software startups for the past two to three years to ensure the effective application of GenAI, which we are witnessing right now.

ABOUT YOU Zalando SE Mon, Jan 20, 2025, 4:10 PM 5 min read In This Article: ZLDSF 0.00% ZLNDY -0.81% Zalando SE (the \"Bidder\" or \"Zalando\") today published the offer document for its voluntary public takeover offer (the \"Takeover Offer\") for the shares of ABOUT YOU Holding SE (\"ABOUT YOU\") following the approval by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (\"BaFin\"). Beginning today, ABOUT YOU shareholders can accept the Takeover Offer and tender their ABOUT YOU shares at a price of EUR 6.50 per share in cash, which represents a premium of 12% to the median analyst target price of 5.80 euros and a premium of 107% to ABOUT YOU's 3-month volume-weighted average share price on 10 December 2024, the last trading day prior to the announcement from Zalando of its intention to submit a Takeover Offer. Through agreements with the major shareholders of ABOUT YOU, Otto Group, Otto Family, HEARTLAND and all three founders and members of the management board of ABOUT YOU, and further purchases, Zalando has already secured almost 80% of the share capital of ABOUT YOU for the transaction. The transaction comes with compelling value creation opportunities that the two companies, operating in the same industry, can generate by collaborating in a wide range of areas. Subject to their review of the offer document, the management board and supervisory board of ABOUT YOU support the Takeover Offer and intend to recommend that ABOUT YOU shareholders accept the Takeover Offer. The acceptance period is expected to end at 24:00 hours on 17 February 2025 (CET). The Takeover Offer is not subject to a minimum acceptance threshold. Closing of the transaction is expected in summer of 2025, subject to obtaining relevant regulatory approvals. Details on how the Takeover Offer can be accepted are set out in the offer document. ABOUT YOU shareholders should contact their respective custodian banks to tender their shares and inquire for any relevant deadlines set by their custodian banks which may require actions prior to the formal end of the acceptance period. The offer document and a non-binding English translation is now available online at https://www.the-perfect-fit.de/. The offer document is also available free of charge from BNP Paribas S.A., Niederlassung Deutschland, Senckenberganlage 19, 60325 Frankfurt am Main, Germany (please send your request, quoting your full address, by fax to +49-69-1520-5277 or by e-mail to frankfurt.gct.operations@bnpparibas.com ).

The firm leverages technology, data, experience, and proprietary strategies to craft products and services for advisors and individual investors. ZEGA Financial helps investors successfully navigate volatile and uncertain markets through innovative hedging strategies. The firm's founding principles grew out of the bestselling book co-authored by Jay Pestrichelli, ZEGA's CEO and Co-Founder, entitled \"Buy and Hedge, the Five Iron Rules for Investing Over the Long Term.\" His book highlights how to bridge the complicated nature of options investing with the needs of the everyday investor Weiterlesen Performance is historical and does not guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Investment returns and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor\u2019s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance data for the most recent month-end is available above. Returns less than one year are cumulative. Shares of any ETF are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and may trade at a discount or premium to NAV. Shares are not individually redeemable from the Fund and may be only be acquired or redeemed from the fund in creation units. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund\u2019s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. * The Distribution Rate is the annual yield an investor would receive if the most recently declared distribution, which includes option income, remained the same going forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by multiplying an ETF\u2019s Distribution per Share by twelve (12), and dividing the resulting amount by the ETF\u2019s most recent NAV. The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return. Distributions are not guaranteed. ** The 30-Day SEC Yield represents net investment income, which excludes option\u00a0income ,\u00a0earned by such ETF over the 30-Day period\u00a0ended\u00a0December 31, 2025, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on such ETF\u2019s share price at the end of the 30-Day period. The Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield is not indicative of future distributions, if any, on the ETFs. In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from month to month and may be zero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant. The distribution may include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease a fund's NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These distribution rates caused by unusually favorable market conditions may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future. Additional fund risks can be found below. Before investing you should carefully consider the Fund\u2019s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other information is in the prospectus. A prospectus may be obtained by clicking here . Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Written Options Risk. The Fund will incur a loss as a result of writing (selling) options (also referred to as a short position) if the price of the written option instrument increases in value between the date the Fund writes the option and the date on which the Fund purchases an offsetting position. The Fund\u2019s losses are potentially large in a written put transaction and potentially unlimited in a written call transaction.). Because of the fund\u2019s strategy of coupling written and purchased puts and call options with the same expiration date and different strike prices, the Fund expects that the maximum potential loss for the Fund for any given credit spread is equal to the difference between the strike prices minus any net premium received. Nonetheless, because up to 90% of the Fund\u2019s portfolio may be subject to this risk \u2013 the value of an investment in the Fund \u2013 could decline significantly and without warning, including to zero. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives include instruments and contracts that are based on and valued in relation to one or more underlying securities, financial benchmarks, indices, or other reference obligations or measures of value. Major types of derivatives include options. Depending on how the Fund uses derivatives and the relationship between the market value of the derivative and the underlying instrument, the use of derivatives could increase or decrease the Fund\u2019s exposure to the risks of the underlying instrument. Using derivatives can have a leveraging effect if the Sub-Adviser is unable to set an appropriate spread between two options held by the Fund and increase Fund volatility. In that event, a small investment in derivatives could have a potentially large impact on the Fund\u2019s performance. Derivatives transactions can be highly illiquid and difficult to unwind or value, and changes in the value of a derivative held by the Fund may not correlate with the value of the underlying instrument or the Fund\u2019s other investments. Many of the risks applicable to trading the instruments underlying derivatives are also applicable to derivatives trading. Financial reform laws have changed many aspects of financial regulation applicable to derivatives. Once implemented, new regulations, including margin, clearing, and trade execution requirements, may make derivatives more costly, may limit their availability, may present different risks or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of these instruments. The extent and impact of these regulations are not yet fully known and may not be known for some time. Interest Rate Risk. Generally fixed income securities decrease in value if interest rates rise and increase in value if interest rates fall, with longer-term securities being more sensitive than shorter-term securities. For example, the price of a security with a one-year duration would be expected to drop by approximately 1% in response to a 1% increase in interest rates. Generally, the longer the maturity and duration of a bond or fixed rate loan, the more sensitive it is to this risk. Falling interest rates also create the potential for a decline in the Fund\u2019s income. These risks are greater during periods of rising inflation. Leveraging Risk. Derivative instruments held by the Fund involve inherent leverage, whereby small cash deposits allow the Fund to hold contracts with greater face value, which may magnify the Fund\u2019s gains or losses. Adverse changes in the value or level of the underlying asset, reference rate or index can result in loss of an amount substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative. In addition, the use of leverage may cause the Fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it would not be advantageous to do so in order to satisfy redemption obligations. Liquidity Risk. Liquidity risk exists when particular investments of the Fund would be difficult to purchase or sell, possibly preventing the Fund from selling such illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price, or possibly requiring the Fund to dispose of other investments at unfavorable times or prices in order to satisfy its obligations. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Non-Diversification Risk. The Fund is classified as \u201cnon-diversified,\u201d which means the Fund may invest a larger percentage of its assets in the securities of a smaller number of issuers than a diversified fund. The Fund will generally have up to 15 credit spreads at any given time, with up to 25% exposure to a single equity index credit spread. Investment in a limited number of equity indexes exposes the Fund to greater market risk and potential losses than if its assets were diversified among a greater number of indexes. Median 30 Day Spread is a calculation of Fund\u2019s median bid-ask spread, expressed as a percentage rounded to the nearest hundredth, computed by: identifying the Fund\u2019s national best bid and national best offer as of the end of each 10 second interval during each trading day of the last 30 calendar days; dividing the difference between each such bid and offer by the midpoint of the national best bid and national best offer; and identifying the median of those values. The S&P 500 Index, or Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index, is a market-capitalization-weighted index of 500 leading publicly traded companies in the U.S. The index actually has 503 components because three of them have two share classes listed.
