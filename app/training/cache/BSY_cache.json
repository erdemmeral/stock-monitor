Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Millionaire Lee Samaha, The Motley Fool Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 12:32 PM 5 min read In this article: BSY Bentley Systems (NASDAQ: BSY) is a growth stock with a big future. The infrastructure-engineering software company is a leader in its industry and offers investors a unique combination of exposure to infrastructure spending (a bipartisan-supported activity) and the exciting megatrend of digitizing engineering processes. This combination is reflected in a company whose technology demonstrably saves public sector money. Introducing Bentley Systems Founded by the remarkable Bentley brothers (five of whom had senior involvement at the company and four of whom still sit on the board today), the company is a leading player in a niche market. To quickly understand what Bentley's software solutions do, it's a good idea to consider how traditional infrastructure projects were carried out. In the pre-digital age, incredibly complex infrastructure projects were designed and developed by many engineers, contractors, and project managers, all of whom held a considerable amount of disparate data (usually in paper form) in their hands. As such, it's not hard to immediately see the potential for significant cost overruns and waste (things the infrastructure industry is notorious for) in this context. Moreover, large infrastructure projects may occur only once or twice in an engineer's lifetime. Unlike the continuous, iteratively refined manufacturing process, such as in a bottling plant or in the manufacture of machine parts, infrastructure engineers don't have much experience in doing precisely the same project repeatedly. That's where Bentley Systems comes in. Its infrastructure-engineering software enables users to create digital 3D designs and documentation for major projects, including bridges, buildings, cities, processing plants, roads, renewable energy projects, and rail systems. As such, the mass of data is stored digitally and is easily accessible by multiple users, enabling better management and monitoring of infrastructure projects along with cost reduction, waste minimization, and better maintenance of projects. Image source: Getty Images. Digital twins In addition, Bentley has a significant, long-term growth opportunity from the growing adoption of digital twins in infrastructure engineering. A digital twin is simply a digital model of a physical asset. The model can simulate to better predict the behavior and progress of the physical asset through its design phase to construction, use, and maintenance. By storing the data centrally and constantly monitoring it with the involvement of multiple users, infrastructure projects can be better managed, completed, and maintained. Story continues Bentley's numbers add up The strength of its software lineup and the growing adoption of digital technology in infrastructure are clear in its financial metrics. For example, Bentley continues to grow its annualized recurring revenue, or ARR (a key metric in the software industry that includes the annualized value of contracts producing revenue) continues to grow at a low-teens rate. That's impressive enough and indicates a strong growth path ahead. Moreover, not only is Bentley good at growing ARR, but it is also good at retaining and growing revenue from its existing customers. For example, its 12-month recurring net retention rate has been above 100% for at least six years. Image source: Getty Images. In plain English, this rate measures recurring revenue growth from existing accounts. In addition, its account retention rate (measuring revenue from existing accounts rather than recurring revenue) has been near 100% over the same period. Consequently, Bentley has high visibility in its future ARR and revenue generation. Bentley Systems valuation As ever with growth stocks with a high amount of earnings visibility, the valuation on the stock won't be superficially cheap. Trading on 43 times expected 2024 earnings, Bentley Systems certainly fits that description. However, with ARR and revenue growing at a low-teens rate and earnings and free cash flow growing at a mid-teens rate, Bentley will likely grow into its valuation. This is driven by ongoing infrastructure investment and the benefits of digitizing infrastructural projects. Will it make you a millionaire? Let's put it this way: A price to free-crash-flow (FCF) multiple of 33 is fair for a long-term growth stock, and based on Wall Street analyst estimates, that's what Bentley will trade on at the end of 2025 based on the current price. If it can grow cash flow at a 15% rate for the next decade and then a 10% rate for the decade after that, and the share price grows in line with earnings, then $100 thousand invested in it now will be worth $1.05 million over the next two decades. While that's out of range for most investors, the return is indicative of a potentially good investment.

Lee joins Bentley from Google, where he served as General Manager for startups and artificial intelligence at Google Cloud. Prior to joining Google in 2020, Lee spent 12 years at SAP, including as Chief Operating Officer for SAP Ariba and Fieldglass, and as Chief Operating Officer and General Manager of Sales for SAP Greater China. He holds a Master of Business Administration degree from Harvard University and a Bachelor of Commerce degree from the University of British Columbia, and is based in the Pacific Northwest.

Nicholas Cumins said, \"I am excited to welcome James, a world-class operational leader, to Bentley. His energy and experience managing operations and investment initiatives at SAP and Google will be instrumental to Bentley as we continue to scale up and drive our ambitious growth agenda.\" To accelerate innovation and better align product execution with technology strategy, Bentley also announced that the responsibility for product development has been consolidated under Chief Technology Officer Julien Moutte. As a result, the Chief Product Officer role has become redundant, and by mutual agreement Mike Campbell will leave the company. \"I would like to thank Mike for his leadership and many accomplishments as Chief Product Officer during the last two years, and wish him much success in his future endeavors,\" Cumins added. \"Streamlining our organizational reporting structure and consolidating product development under Julien puts us in a stronger position to capture the many growth opportunities that we have opened up with infrastructure AI and that are incremental to our core business and consistent momentum.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our 9 Best Market-Beating Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Bentley Systems, Incorporated (NASDAQ:BSY) A Top Quality Stock? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Thu, Jan 9, 2025, 5:24 PM 3 min read In This Article: BSY Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine Bentley Systems, Incorporated ( NASDAQ:BSY ), by way of a worked example. ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Bentley Systems How Is ROE Calculated? The formula for ROE is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Bentley Systems is: 35% = US$364m \u00f7 US$1.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024). The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.35. Does Bentley Systems Have A Good Return On Equity? Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Bentley Systems has a better ROE than the average (12%) in the Software industry . NasdaqGS:BSY Return on Equity January 9th 2025 That's clearly a positive. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk. How Does Debt Impact ROE? Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking. Combining Bentley Systems' Debt And Its 35% Return On Equity It's worth noting the high use of debt by Bentley Systems, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.37. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it. Story Continues Conclusion Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better. But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

Hu\u0159\u0165\u00e1k Wed, Dec 25, 2024, 12:07 PM 3 min read In This Article: BSY Two Reasons to Watch BSY and One to Stay Cautious Over the past six months, Bentley\u2019s shares (currently trading at $47.62) have posted a disappointing 5.3% loss, well below the S&P 500\u2019s 10.4% gain. This was partly driven by its softer quarterly results and might have investors contemplating their next move. Following the drawdown, is now an opportune time to buy BSY? Find out in our full research report, it\u2019s free . Why Does Bentley Spark Debate? Founded by brothers Keith and Barry Bentley, Bentley Systems (NASDAQ:BSY) offers a software-as-a-service platform that addresses the lifecycle of infrastructure projects such as road networks, tunnel systems, and wastewater facilities. Two Things to Like: 1. Strong Retention Supports Growth and Profitability One of the best parts about the software-as-a-service business model (and a reason why they trade at high valuation multiples) is that customers typically spend more on a company\u2019s products and services over time. Bentley\u2019s net revenue retention rate, a key performance metric measuring how much money existing customers from a year ago are spending today, was 109% in Q3. This means Bentley would\u2019ve grown its revenue by 8.5% even if it didn\u2019t win any new customers over the last 12 months. Bentley Net Revenue Retention Rate Bentley has a decent net retention rate, showing us that its customers not only tend to stick around but also get increasing value from its software over time. 2. Operating Margin Reveals a Well-Run Organization Many software businesses adjust their profits for stock-based compensation (SBC), but we prioritize GAAP operating margin because SBC is a real expense used to attract and retain engineering and sales talent. This is one of the best measures of profitability because it shows how much money a company takes home after developing, marketing, and selling its products. Bentley has been a well-oiled machine over the last year. It demonstrated elite profitability for a software business, boasting an average operating margin of 21.2%. This result isn\u2019t surprising as its high gross margin gives it a favorable starting point. Bentley Operating Margin (GAAP) One Reason to be Careful: Weak Billings Point to Soft Demand Billings is a non-GAAP metric that is often called \u201ccash revenue\u201d because it shows how much money the company has collected from customers in a certain period. This is different from revenue, which must be recognized in pieces over the length of a contract. Bentley\u2019s billings came in at $324.4 million in Q3, and over the last four quarters, its year-on-year growth averaged 8.2%. This performance was underwhelming and suggests that increasing competition is causing challenges in acquiring/retaining customers. Story Continues Bentley Billings Final Judgment Bentley has huge potential even though it has some open questions. After the recent drawdown, the stock trades at 10.9\u00d7 forward price-to-sales (or $47.62 per share). Is now a good time to buy? See for yourself in our in-depth research report, it\u2019s free .

Highs And Lows: Bentley (NASDAQ:BSY) Vs The Rest Of The Vertical Software Stocks Kayode Omotosho Tue, Dec 10, 2024, 1:05 PM 5 min read In This Article: BSY ALRM MANH Q3 Earnings Highs And Lows: Bentley (NASDAQ:BSY) Vs The Rest Of The Vertical Software Stocks The end of the earnings season is always a good time to take a step back and see who shined (and who not so much). Let\u2019s take a look at how vertical software stocks fared in Q3, starting with Bentley (NASDAQ:BSY). Software is eating the world, and while a large number of solutions such as project management or video conferencing software can be useful to a wide array of industries, some have very specific needs. As a result, vertical software, which addresses industry-specific workflows, is growing and fueled by the pressures to improve productivity, whether it be for a life sciences, education, or banking company. The 4 vertical software stocks we track reported a strong Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 1.8% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 2% above. In light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady. On average, they are relatively unchanged since the latest earnings results. Weakest Q3: Bentley (NASDAQ:BSY) Founded by brothers Keith and Barry Bentley, Bentley Systems (NASDAQ:BSY) offers a software-as-a-service platform that addresses the lifecycle of infrastructure projects such as road networks, tunnel systems, and wastewater facilities. Bentley reported revenues of $335.2 million, up 9.3% year on year. This print fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations by 1.7%. Overall, it was a slower quarter for the company with a slight miss of analysts\u2019 billings estimates and EBITDA in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. CEO Nicholas Cumins said, \u201cDuring my first 100 days as CEO, we unveiled ambitious strategic moves that will help propel our future growth: the acquisition of 3D geospatial company Cesium; a strategic partnership with Google to integrate their geospatial content; a new product portfolio for asset analytics and a new generation of engineering applications, both leveraging AI and digital twin technologies to improve the way infrastructure is designed, built, and operated.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed\u2019s rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has been on a steady path downward, easing back toward that 2% sweet spot. Fortunately (miraculously to some), all this tightening didn\u2019t send the economy tumbling into a recession, so here we are, cautiously celebrating a soft landing. The cherry on top? Recent rate cuts (half a point in September, a quarter in November) have kept 2024 stock markets frothy, especially after Trump\u2019s November win lit a fire under major indices and sent them to all-time highs. However, there's still plenty to ponder \u2014 tariffs, corporate tax cuts, and what 2025 might hold for the economy. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals?

That is because the Dec 20, 2024 $70.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. What is Implied Volatility? Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy. What do the Analysts Think? Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Bentley Systems shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Bentley Systems is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Internet - Software industry that ranks in the Top 16% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while three have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from earnings of 25 cents per share to 23 cents in that period. Given the way analysts feel about Bentley Systems right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected. Looking to Trade Options?

Better-for-You Food a Promising, Yet Challenging Emerging Industry David Mantey Tue, Dec 24, 2024, 9:24 AM 6 min read Better-for-you (BFY) food brands are having a moment. More than one-third of the food and beverage companies on this year's Inc. 5000 list, which compiles the fastest-growing companies in the U.S., are focused on making healthier food and drink options. Inc. ranks companies based on revenue growth from 2020 through 2023. Based in Wolcott, Indiana, Egglife Foods has experienced explosive growth of 796% over three years. In the last four years, Egglife grew from a $4 million company to $50 million, placing the company in the top 14% of fast-growing food and beverage brands.

In this exclusive interview, Egglife's new Chief Revenue Officer and former Clif Bar exec Brent Gravlee and Jihan Miller, Egglife's VP of R&D, discuss the unique manufacturing and packaging challenges the BSY category poses and how the company plans to scale with demand. This interview has been edited for length. David Mantey (DM): Why did you leave Clif Bar? Brent Gravlee (BG): I was fortunate to be part of Clif Bar through some really amazing times. I joined the company in 2006 when revenue was about $200 million and saw the company grow to over $1 billion during my 17-year tenure. While I learned and grew immeasurably during my time at Clif, there are two things that impacted me the most: the purposeful culture and the dedicated people. In 2022, Clif Bar was acquired by Mondelez, and my role was eliminated through the integration process. As heartbreaking as it was to leave my friends and long-time corporate home, my parting gift was a vision for what's possible when you combine delicious food that uniquely meets consumers' needs, a talented team, and a culture that empowers and motivates the team to deliver outstanding work. Egglife has all of these pieces in spades, and I believe Egglife is on the precipice of cracking open the way people think about eating. DM: Does the better-for-you food industry pose any unique manufacturing challenges? Jihan Miller (JM): We have a few manufacturing challenges in the [BFY] space. First, we want to ensure our products have a clean label, which starts with the raw materials that we source. BFY brands have to be very intentional about the ingredients we use, where they come from, and what they are made of. This becomes particularly challenging when it comes to preservatives. Natural preservative options are limited, and ensuring the preservative system is both effective at keeping our product fresh and as natural as possible is crucial for BFY products. Another unique manufacturing challenge is that many BFY brands are refrigerated, like Egglife egg white wraps, which requires manufacturing processes and a supply chain that can support refrigeration. Story Continues Egglife Foods has a proprietary process that allows the company to replace flour with egg whites to create protein-packed, low-carb wraps. Egglife Foods has a proprietary process that allows the company to replace flour with egg whites to create protein-packed, low-carb wraps. Egglife Foods DM: Does the industry pose any unique packaging challenges? JM: Absolutely. Packaging food, especially fresh food, requires that our packaging has a strong enough barrier to keep the food fresh and protect it from environmental influences. Fresh foods are often packaged in modified atmospheres to maximize shelf life and ensure bacteria can't proliferate. To preserve this modified atmosphere, we need to have adequate barriers that will minimize moisture and oxygen transmission, anti-microbial packaging, light protection, and more to ensure the clean label preservatives are effective. There's also a big push for sustainable packaging, which is exciting but comes with some challenges. Sustainable materials can add significant costs which consumers aren't necessarily willing to pay. Also, sustainable packaging technologies don't currently offer the necessary barriers to protect foods like Egglife wraps and keep them fresh. DM: How are egg white wraps made? JM: We have a proprietary process that allows us to replace flour with egg whites to create protein-packed, low-carb wraps that are gluten-free and delicious. The process and product are patented, but it is very simple \u2014 it starts with an egg white wrap mix, we combine the ingredients, we cook it, we cool it down, and then we pack the wraps. The magic is in the details. All Egglife wraps are produced at our plant in Wolcott, IN. All Egglife Foods wraps are produced at the company's plant in Wolcott, IN. All Egglife Foods wraps are produced at the company's plant in Wolcott, IN. Egglife Foods DM: As chief revenue officer, what are the tools you use that you couldn't live without? BG: My number one, most powerful tool is my personal board of directors. This includes my wife, trusted friends, and current/former colleagues whom I lean on daily for advice, encouragement, and strength. One work tool that I couldn't live without is a monthly causal report card to show us what's going on in the business, how our products are performing relative to the category and competition, and what tactics are driving the trends. Another one is the live meeting. As much as I love Zoom and Teams for the time they've afforded me at home vs. on the road, nothing replaces a face-to-face with the customer or with the team. In my experience, the richest and most actionable conversations always seem to happen during the \"in-between\" moments \u2014 in the car, in the lobby, in the hall, in the break room. You don't get those with virtual meetings. The last tool I couldn't live without is running shoes. I'm not a particularly talented runner, but getting out to stretch my legs and my lungs allows me to clear my head, re-center on top priorities, and show up to work with renewed focus and energy. Natural preservative options are limited, and ensuring the preservative system is both effective at keeping Egglife products fresh and as natural as possible is crucial for better-for-you products. Natural preservative options are limited, and ensuring the preservative system is both effective at keeping Egglife products fresh and as natural as possible is crucial for better-for-you products. Egglife Foods DM: How does Egglife plan to scale and avert typical food manufacturing growing pains? BG: We're a very consumer-centric brand and we're thrilled that our wraps have become so popular that we've needed to adapt our processes to scale with demand. Right now, we are actively scaling our production in phases for a modular expansion, allowing us to learn as we grow and continue increasing our capacity. Part of our advantage is that we own our processing lines, and we're using data-driven decision-making to add automation that allows us to scale with efficiency and speed. DM: What are your expectations for the future of the better-for-you food category? BG: The definition of \"better-for-you\" has evolved since I started working in the space in 2006, and it will continue to evolve as consumers look to food to help them address their changing needs. One trend that has been continuing to grow for the past several years is protein. More consumers are actively seeking higher protein and lower carb options, with a preference for natural ingredients. As a result, I think we'll see more retailers create protein destinations where consumers can easily find protein-rich meals and snacks across categories. We will continue to see the merging of better-for-you and convenience. The most exciting innovations are ones where consumers can get a better-for-you alternative that is even more versatile and convenient than some conventional options.
