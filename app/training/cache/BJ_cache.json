Moreover, BJ's remains focused on bolstering its omnichannel operations and broadening delivery services to meet evolving customer needs. Membership Growth Fuels BJ\u2019s Momentum BJ's Wholesale Club has achieved impressive growth by refining its marketing and merchandising strategies while diversifying its private-label offerings and expanding into high-demand product categories. These strategic moves have significantly increased membership signups and renewals, driving a notable rise in membership fee revenues. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, BJ\u2019s reported an 8.4% year-over-year increase in membership fee income, fueled by strong renewal rates and successful membership acquisition efforts.

BJ\u2019s Digital Transformation Drives Engagement BJ's Wholesale Club has invested heavily in its digital capabilities to better connect with members and offer a seamless shopping experience. Key offerings include same-day delivery, curbside pickup, and buy-online, pick-up-in-club services. The company has built a comprehensive digital ecosystem with platforms like BJs.com, BerkleyJensen.com, WellsleyFarms.com and BJ\u2019s mobile app, enabling members to browse and purchase products, add digital coupons and track annual savings. To enhance convenience, BJ's Wholesale Club has partnered with DoorDash, Instacart and Roadie for on-demand delivery. The company also introduced the Same-Day Select program, allowing members to pay an upfront fee for unlimited or 12 same-day grocery deliveries per year, offering added flexibility and convenience.

worried about being targeted by Trump administration's food industry critics Brian Sozzi \u00b7 Executive Editor Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 10:18 PM 3 min read In this article: AMZN -0.11% WMT +1.41% CPB -1.65% TGT -2.72% KO -0.20% DAVOS, SWITZERLAND \u2014 PepsiCo ( PEP ) CEO Ramon Laguarta wants to change the minds of food industry critics inside the new Trump administration. \"It's not a worry. I think we've been leading the transformation of the food industry for many years,\" Laguarta said on Yahoo Finance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Continued Laguarta, \"We've been leaders in sodium reduction, we've been leaders in sugar reduction. We've been leaders in eliminating fat from products. We've been leading in artificial colors.\" Sentiment around packaged foods stocks has soured in part due to the new administration. Trump's pick to run Health & Human Services (HHS), Robert Kennedy Jr., is a noted longtime critic of the packaged foods industry. Meanwhile, the outgoing surgeon general warned this month alcohol should come with cancer risk labels. And the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned the use of red dye No. 3 in food, drinks, and ingested drugs. Laguarta said Pepsi doesn't have the dye in its US portfolio. The barrage of health news has investors worried packaged food players may have to reformulate products at a significant cost. The bad press isn't exactly great for business, either. Shares of PepsiCo are down about 14% in the past three months, underperforming the S&P 500's ( ^GSPC ) 5% gain. The stock price of rival Coca-Cola ( KO ) is down 9% over the same stretch, while Spam maker Hormel's ( HRL ) shares are off by 3%. \u2022 USD (PEP) Follow View quote details \"In the US, I would like for us to be also working with the new administration on how do we move forward eliminating artificial colors from food in the US. And I think it should be science-based. It should be very pragmatic,\" Laguarta said of PepsiCo's aim to be part of the solution. \"We as an industry should aspire to, in three or four years, no artificial colors in food. It is ambitious. I think it is doable, and it should be a private, private-public cooperation that drives that outcome.\" For PepsiCo investors, the pressured stock price also reflects its recent performance in its snacks and beverages businesses. Both have slowed amid more cautious spending by lower-income households. A rising US dollar \u2014 which weighs on international sales \u2014 hasn't helped. Third quarter sales and earnings fell 0.6% and 5% year over year, respectively. The Street is bracing for mixed results and an accompanying 2025 outlook when the company reports on Feb. 4. \"After a tumultuous year in 2024, which began with PepsiCo guiding towards the top end of their long-term algorithm and eventually finished with organic sales below algorithm after three downward revisions on the top line, we believe PepsiCo management understands the reality of the situation and need for improvement. We would expect a below algorithm guide on the top and bottom lines,\" warned RBC analyst Nik Modi. Story continues Modi rates PepsiCo shares at Sector Perform. \"While numbers are already below algo (and believe buy side bar is below cons.), we still see potential for muted 2025 earnings as we believe PepsiCo will have a bias to reinvest to support some of the weaker parts of the business until there is greater signs of stabilization,\" Modi said. \u2014 Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.
