Footwear sales\u2013like their apparel counterparts\u2013are driven by seasons, trends, and innovation more so than absolute need and similarly face the bigger-picture secular trend of e-commerce penetration. Footwear plays a part in societal belonging, personal expression, and occasion, and retailers selling shoes recognize this. Therefore, they aim to balance selection, competitive prices, and the latest trends to attract consumers. Unlike their apparel counterparts, footwear retailers most sell popular third-party brands (as opposed to their own exclusive brands), which could mean less exclusivity of product but more nimbleness to pivot to what\u2019s hot. The 4 footwear retailer stocks we track reported a slower Q3. As a group, revenues missed analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 2% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was in line. Amidst this news, share prices of the companies have had a rough stretch. On average, they are down 5.4% since the latest earnings results. Shoe Carnival (NASDAQ:SCVL) Known for its playful atmosphere that features carnival elements, Shoe Carnival (NASDAQ:SCVL) is a retailer that sells footwear from mainstream brands for the entire family. Shoe Carnival reported revenues of $306.9 million, down 4.1% year on year. This print fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations by 3%. Overall, it was a slower quarter for the company with a slight miss of analysts\u2019 gross margin and EBITDA estimates. \u201cOur Back-to-School results were strong, with comparable store sales growth across our banners and robust margins. Our flexible digital-first marketing campaign and great brand assortment drove demand during this peak shopping period and profitability in line with expectations for the third quarter. I am very proud of our team for delivering the Company\u2019s profit results despite two significant hurricanes disrupting third quarter sales and a very warm October that delayed the start of our winter boot season,\u201d said Mark Worden, President and Chief Executive Officer.

Market Update In response to the Fed's rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has been gradually trending down from its post-pandemic peak, trending closer to the Fed's 2% target. Despite higher borrowing costs, the economy has avoided flashing recessionary signals. This is the much-desired soft landing that many investors hoped for. The recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% in November 2024) have bolstered the stock market, making 2024 a strong year for equities. Donald Trump\u2019s presidential win in November sparked additional market gains, sending indices to record highs in the days following his victory. However, debates continue over possible tariffs and corporate tax adjustments, raising questions about economic stability in 2025. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals?

Francisco Velasquez Thu, Jan 23, 2025, 9:09 PM 2 min read In This Article: NKE -0.40% Nike CEO Elliot Hill on the field during a game between the Oregon Ducks and the Ohio State Buckeyes at Autzen Stadium on October12, 2024. - Image: Tom Hauck (Getty Images) When Elliot Hill took over as Nike\u2019s CEO , he knew the company was struggling, but one moment apparently made it clear just how bad things had become. It was December 2024, at the AT&T Stadium ( T ) in Dallas, when Hill said he realized the extent of the crisis. Nike ( NKE ) had secured a crucial contract extension with the NFL for its uniforms, narrowly avoiding the loss of one of its most important partnerships, Fortune first reported. \u201cRoger was my first phone call when I took over,\u201d Hill told the magazine, referring to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. Though Nike had dodged a major blow, nearly losing the deal to a competitor helped Hill see the scale of the sportswear giant\u2019s crisis \u2014 and the bigger picture was grim. Nike faced its worst year in decades in 2024. Sales had dropped globally, and the stock had fallen nearly 60% from its 2021 highs. The sportswear giant\u2019s troubles weren\u2019t just financial ; they were cultural and strategic . Former CEO John Donahoe\u2019s aggressive push into e-commerce had backfired. In April 2024, he stated that he was fed up with remote work and that a \u201cboldly disruptive shoe\u201d couldn\u2019t be made on Zoom. In a push to boost online sales, Nike severed ties with major retailers, including Macy\u2019s, DSW ( DBI ), and Foot Locker ( FL ). Meanwhile, Nike laid off hundreds of employees , including senior executives. Hill, who has over 30 years of experience at Nike, seemed to waste no time confronting the issues. During a December earnings call, he laid out a plan on the company\u2019s core \u2013 sport and performance \u2013 and to repair damaged retailer relationships . The road to recovery won\u2019t be quick , but Hill has emphasized the importance of a long-term strategy over short-term pain. Wall Street, though cautious , shared similar sentiments and remained optimistic about Hill\u2019s leadership, given his role in growing Nike to over $39 billion in annual revenue. When the company reported its second-quarter earnings, results came in better than expected . Nike\u2019s current plan is to pivot . The company is cutting back on taste-making street teams across 12 cities globally, and leaning on Air Jordan and Dunk nostalgia. Sneaker innovation, once a key driver , has taken a backseat , according to Fortune. Whether AI will play a role , or how President Donald Trump\u2019s looming tariffs may impact this pivot, remains to be seen. Looking ahead, Nike is also focusing on personalized gear and unearthing new ways to connect with consumers in the age of social media. Whether AI will play a role , or how President Donald Trump\u2019s looming tariffs may impact this pivot, remains to be seen. For the latest news, Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .

Retailer Stocks Radek Strnad Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 12:04 PM 4 min read In This Article: DBI -6.16% BOOT -9.53% SCVL -5.91% FL -5.84% Q3 Rundown: Designer Brands (NYSE:DBI) Vs Other Footwear Retailer Stocks As the craze of earnings season draws to a close, here\u2019s a look back at some of the most exciting (and some less so) results from Q3. Today, we are looking at footwear retailer stocks, starting with Designer Brands (NYSE:DBI). Footwear sales\u2013like their apparel counterparts\u2013are driven by seasons, trends, and innovation more so than absolute need and similarly face the bigger-picture secular trend of e-commerce penetration. Footwear plays a part in societal belonging, personal expression, and occasion, and retailers selling shoes recognize this. Therefore, they aim to balance selection, competitive prices, and the latest trends to attract consumers. Unlike their apparel counterparts, footwear retailers most sell popular third-party brands (as opposed to their own exclusive brands), which could mean less exclusivity of product but more nimbleness to pivot to what\u2019s hot. The 4 footwear retailer stocks we track reported a slower Q3. As a group, revenues missed analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 2% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was in line. Amidst this news, share prices of the companies have had a rough stretch. On average, they are down 7.2% since the latest earnings results. Designer Brands (NYSE:DBI) Founded in 1969 as a shoe importer and distributor, Designer Brands (NYSE:DBI) is an American discount retailer focused on footwear and accessories. Designer Brands reported revenues of $777.2 million, down 1.2% year on year. This print fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations by 3.1%.

Market Update The Fed\u2019s interest rate hikes throughout 2022 and 2023 have successfully cooled post-pandemic inflation, bringing it closer to the 2% target. Inflationary pressures have eased without tipping the economy into a recession, suggesting a soft landing. This stability, paired with recent rate cuts (0.5% in September 2024 and 0.25% in November 2024), fueled a strong year for the stock market in 2024. The markets surged further after Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory in November, with major indices reaching record highs in the days following the election. Still, questions remain about the direction of economic policy, as potential tariffs and corporate tax changes add uncertainty for 2025. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals?

Brands Inc. (NYSE:DBI) At US$5.27? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 1:34 PM 3 min read In This Article: DBI -6.16% Designer Brands Inc. ( NYSE:DBI ), might not be a large cap stock, but it saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. While good news for shareholders, the company has traded much higher in the past year. Less-covered, small caps sees more of an opportunity for mispricing due to the lack of information available to the public, which can be a good thing. So, could the stock still be trading at a low price relative to its actual value? Let\u2019s examine Designer Brands\u2019s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there\u2019s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for Designer Brands Is Designer Brands Still Cheap? According to our valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 39%, trading at US$5.27 compared to our intrinsic value of $3.79. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that Designer Brands\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility. What kind of growth will Designer Brands generate? NYSE:DBI Earnings and Revenue Growth January 15th 2025 Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of Designer Brands, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting top-line growth of 3.1% in the next few years, which doesn\u2019t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn\u2019t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term. What This Means For You Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in DBI\u2019s future outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question \u2013 is now the right time to sell? If you believe DBI should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed. Are you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on DBI for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there\u2019s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

Hold Post Q3 Earnings? Adam Hejl Wed, Jan 15, 2025, 12:05 PM 3 min read In This Article: DBI -6.16% Designer Brands (DBI): Buy, Sell, or Hold Post Q3 Earnings? Designer Brands\u2019s stock price has taken a beating over the past six months, shedding 21.7% of its value and falling to $5.34 per share. This was partly due to its softer quarterly results and may have investors wondering how to approach the situation. Is there a buying opportunity in Designer Brands, or does it present a risk to your portfolio? Dive into our full research report to see our analyst team\u2019s opinion, it\u2019s free . Even though the stock has become cheaper, we're cautious about Designer Brands. Here are three reasons why there are better opportunities than DBI and a stock we'd rather own. Why Do We Think Designer Brands Will Underperform? Founded in 1969 as a shoe importer and distributor, Designer Brands (NYSE:DBI) is an American discount retailer focused on footwear and accessories. 1. Shrinking Same-Store Sales Indicate Waning Demand Same-store sales is a key performance indicator used to measure organic growth at brick-and-mortar shops for at least a year. Designer Brands\u2019s demand has been shrinking over the last two years as its same-store sales have averaged 6.1% annual declines. Designer Brands Same-Store Sales Growth 2. Free Cash Flow Margin Dropping If you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills. As you can see below, Designer Brands\u2019s margin dropped by 12.7 percentage points over the last year. This decrease came from the higher costs associated with opening more stores. Designer Brands Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin 3. Short Cash Runway Exposes Shareholders to Potential Dilution As long-term investors, the risk we care about most is the permanent loss of capital, which can happen when a company goes bankrupt or raises money from a disadvantaged position. This is separate from short-term stock price volatility, something we are much less bothered by. Designer Brands burned through $79.58 million of cash over the last year, and its $1.34 billion of debt exceeds the $36.23 million of cash on its balance sheet. This is a deal breaker for us because indebted loss-making companies spell trouble. Designer Brands Net Debt Position Unless the Designer Brands\u2019s fundamentals change quickly, it might find itself in a position where it must raise capital from investors to continue operating. Whether that would be favorable is unclear because dilution is a headwind for shareholder returns. We remain cautious of Designer Brands until it generates consistent free cash flow or any of its announced financing plans materialize on its balance sheet. Final Judgment Designer Brands falls short of our quality standards. After the recent drawdown, the stock trades at 7\u00d7 forward price-to-earnings (or $5.34 per share). While this valuation is optically cheap, the potential downside is huge given its shaky fundamentals. There are superior stocks to buy right now. We\u2019d suggest looking at Uber, whose profitability just reached an inflection point . Story Continues Stocks We Would Buy Instead of Designer Brands With rates dropping, inflation stabilizing, and the elections in the rearview mirror, all signs point to the start of a new bull run - and we\u2019re laser-focused on finding the best stocks for this upcoming cycle.

-9.53% SCVL -5.91% DBI -6.16% FL -5.84% Q3 Footwear Retailer Earnings: Boot Barn (NYSE:BOOT) Impresses As the Q3 earnings season wraps, let\u2019s dig into this quarter\u2019s best and worst performers in the footwear retailer industry, including Boot Barn (NYSE:BOOT) and its peers. Footwear sales\u2013like their apparel counterparts\u2013are driven by seasons, trends, and innovation more so than absolute need and similarly face the bigger-picture secular trend of e-commerce penetration. Footwear plays a part in societal belonging, personal expression, and occasion, and retailers selling shoes recognize this. Therefore, they aim to balance selection, competitive prices, and the latest trends to attract consumers. Unlike their apparel counterparts, footwear retailers most sell popular third-party brands (as opposed to their own exclusive brands), which could mean less exclusivity of product but more nimbleness to pivot to what\u2019s hot. The 4 footwear retailer stocks we track reported a slower Q3. As a group, revenues missed analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 2% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was in line. While some footwear retailer stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they have collectively declined. On average, share prices are down 4.8% since the latest earnings results. Best Q3: Boot Barn (NYSE:BOOT) With a strong store presence in Texas, California, Florida, and Oklahoma, Boot Barn (NYSE:BOOT) is a western-inspired apparel and footwear retailer. Boot Barn reported revenues of $425.8 million, up 13.7% year on year. This print was in line with analysts\u2019 expectations, but overall, it was a mixed quarter for the company with a solid beat of analysts\u2019 EBITDA estimates but EPS guidance for next quarter missing analysts\u2019 expectations. Mr. Starrett stated, \u201cJohn Hazen is very highly regarded within the Boot Barn organization and has a diverse background that includes brand building, digital, and store roles. He has a strong track record of growing sales and profits both at Boot Barn and prior to joining the Company. He also has been extremely instrumental in advancing Boot Barn\u2019s customer-facing technology capabilities including many industry-leading applications of artificial intelligence. I am confident in his ability to step into the role as Interim CEO. Personally, I am looking forward to providing oversight and mentorship as Executive Chairman while the Board conducts an internal and external search before making a permanent decision on our next CEO.\u201d Boot Barn Total Revenue Boot Barn achieved the biggest analyst estimates beat, fastest revenue growth, and highest full-year guidance raise of the whole group. The results were likely priced in, however, and the stock is flat since reporting. It currently trades at $162. Story Continues Is now the time to buy Boot Barn?

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our 9 Best Market-Beating Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

\u00b7 Yujin Kim/Retail Dive Cara Salpini Aktualisiert Sat, Jan 18, 2025, 2:45 PM 3 Minuten Lesezeit In diesem Artikel: DBI -6.16% This story was originally published on Retail Dive . To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Retail Dive newsletter . Editor's note: We have updated this article to remove references to proprietary data from CreditRiskMonitor. We have also removed references to companies listed in that data. Each year comes with its own big bankruptcy stories, whether surprise filings or retailers that have been suffering for some time. A couple of those surfaced in the last few days of 2024. Just before Christmas, Party City filed for bankruptcy for the second time in less than two years, with plans to close all of its stores, and The Container Store entered Chapter 11 with a plan to be acquired by its term lenders. Those stories will continue to play out in 2025, but they were far from the only ones to seek out the courts last year. Retail Dive tracked close to 20 notable bankruptcies in 2024, including repeat offenders like Rue 21 and relative newcomers like Foxtrot. Some, like Joann and 99 Cents Only, had been at risk for years . Among those that sought out bankruptcy protection were a host of well-known names, including Tupperware, Big Lots and Express. That being said, the last couple of years have seen a spike of defaults and retail distress will likely decline in 2025, according to Moody\u2019s Ratings Vice President of Corporate Finance Raya Sokolyanska. There are fewer retailers now with weak capital structures because they\u2019ve already filed \u2014 and access to capital for at-risk borrowers has also improved. \u201cNevertheless, pockets of risk remain, as discretionary retailers are under stress from increasingly purposeful and value-seeking consumer spending, particularly among lower income households,\u201d Sokolyanska said via email. \u201cHome goods, hobby and apparel retailers dominate the distressed retailer list. Home goods retailers continue to be hurt by low home sales, as well as weak demand for pandemic-era favored products. Hobby retailers, such as crafts, are similarly impacted by the consumer pivot to other categories such as experiences.\u201d Moody\u2019s own distressed list currently features retailers including Joann, Saks Global, Guitar Center and At Home. (Joann filed for bankruptcy for the second time in about a year after this story was initially published). Some of those same companies are of concern to S&P Global Ratings, according to Bea Chiem, retail and consumer managing director at the firm. Chiem noted on a call with Retail Dive that At Home, Guitar Center and Qurate were a few companies with concerning credit ratings and that continued economic softness could lead to more trouble in the sector.

And so we do think that potentially there could be more negative rating actions heading into \u201925 and there could be a risk of greater defaults next year.\u201d The impact of tariffs, which President-elect Donald Trump has indicated are coming , could also be a factor this year, as it will likely drive up prices and cause inflation to worsen, harming consumer wallets further. That, of course, will hurt retailers who import more products from abroad, Chiem said, and particularly discretionary categories. More retailers will file for bankruptcy in the year ahead, the question is simply who they will be. While it\u2019s impossible to predict with certainty which businesses will file in a given year, especially as unforeseen circumstances can tip a company over the edge, these insights can help give a sense of what sectors to watch and which retailers specifically may be struggling.

36-Month Study Confirming Long-Term Effectiveness of Standalone OMNI Surgical System in Managing Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Sight Sciences, Inc. Wed, Jan 8, 2025, 12:05 AM 6 min read In This Article: SGHT -2.50% Sight Sciences, Inc. The study is the largest to date evaluating clinical outcomes of standalone canaloplasty and trabeculotomy. It analyzes real-world data from the American Academy of Ophthalmology IRIS\u00ae Registry and demonstrates sustained intraocular pressure reductions and decreased medication dependence MENLO PARK, Calif., Jan. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sight Sciences , Inc. (Nasdaq: SGHT) (\u201cSight Sciences\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), an eyecare technology company focused on developing and commercializing innovative, interventional technologies intended to transform care and improve patients\u2019 lives, today announced the publication of a landmark 36-month analysis evaluating the long-term effectiveness of the OMNI\u00ae Surgical System (\u201cOMNI\u201d) in managing primary open-angle glaucoma (\u201cPOAG\u201d). This study, in press in the American Journal of Ophthalmology and based on data from the American Academy of Ophthalmology IRIS\u00ae Registry (Intelligent Research in Sight), presents compelling evidence supporting the sustained benefits of standalone canaloplasty and trabeculotomy with OMNI, independent of cataract surgery. This real-world study, led by Nathan M. Radcliffe, MD, of Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, evaluated 230 eyes of 196 patients with POAG through up to 36 months. The results demonstrate clinically and statistically significant reductions in intraocular pressure (\u201cIOP\u201d) through up to 36 months postoperatively, with mean reductions ranging from 5.6 to 7.1 mmHg. The study also reports a statistically significant decrease in medication use through 18 months. Eyes with lower baseline IOP experienced medication reduction through 36 months. \u201cThere is a growing interest in using minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (\u201cMIGS\u201d) as a standalone procedure for patients with pseudophakic or precataractous eyes,\u201d said Nathan M. Radcliffe, MD, lead investigator of the study and Associate Professor at the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York. \u201cThis analysis represents one of the most comprehensive, real-world evaluations of standalone canaloplasty and trabeculotomy in these patient populations to date. Our findings underscore the ability of OMNI to achieve significant and sustained reductions in IOP and medication use over three years, reinforcing its position as a highly effective interventional treatment for patients with primary open-angle glaucoma.\u201d Key Study Findings: Sustained IOP Reduction: Mean (SD) baseline IOP was 22.1 (6.4) mmHg. Over 36 months of follow-up, mean IOP ranged from 15.1 to 16.7 mmHg (p<0.0001 at every time point compared to baseline), with average eye-level reductions of 5.6 to 7.1 mmHg. Greater IOP Reductions in High Baseline IOP Patients: Subgroup analysis showed even greater IOP reductions (up to 8.9 mmHg) in patients with baseline IOP greater than 18 mmHg. Eyes with lower baseline IOP (<18 mmHg) had reductions in medication use through 36 months, and eyes with higher baseline IOP (>18 mmHg) had statistically significant reductions in IOP and reductions in medication use through 36 months. Reduced Medication Dependence: The study observed a notable decrease in the need for IOP-lowering medications, reducing patient dependence on adherence-prone therapies. The mean number of glaucoma medications used at baseline was 2.1 (1.5) and ranged from 1.1 to 1.6 medication classes between months 6 and 36, with statistically significant decreases in utilization through 18 months postoperatively (p<0.0011). Story Continues Paul Badawi, President and CEO of Sight Sciences added, \u201cWe are excited to see such compelling evidence highlighting OMNI\u2019s long-term impact. This study further strengthens the extensive body of clinical data that supports the safety and efficacy of the OMNI procedure. It reinforces our commitment to delivering innovative, data-driven interventional technologies that empower physicians to elevate patient care. OMNI continues to set new standards in minimally invasive glaucoma surgery, driving our mission to transform eyecare for the millions affected by glaucoma.\u201d The OMNI Surgical System enables an implant-free, ab interno MIGS procedure intended to restore aqueous outflow of glaucomatous eyes by addressing the three areas of outflow resistance associated with the disease. This retrospective, observational cohort study of the procedure drew data from the IRIS Registry, the first comprehensive eye disease clinical registry in the United States. Launched in 2014, it has amassed over 851 million patient encounters and 80 million unique de-identified patients from nearly 30 electronic health records systems (EHRs) and 15,000 ophthalmologists and other eye care professionals across the U.S., as of July 1, 2024. This study provides invaluable insights into the real-world effectiveness of OMNI, offering a crucial data-driven resource for ophthalmologists seeking to improve outcomes for patients with POAG.

To celebrate the individuality and craftsmanship of the newest bridal collection, David's tapped Kelsey to help personify the authenticity, personality, and passion she shares with the collection. In her first bridal collaboration, Kelsey brings the magic of David's to life as she prepares for her own walk down the aisle. \"Planning my wedding is such a special chapter in my life, and starting my dress journey with David's Bridal has been the perfect way to discover all of the latest bridal trends and fashions,\" said Kelsey Anderson, Reality Star and current bride-to-be. \"With David's Bridal, I get to share with fans the start of my dream bridal journey, starting with finding the perfect dress.

Doug Howe -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. We were pleased with our strong start to the third quarter, anchored on the success of back-to-school season, which was fueled by our athletic and athleisure offerings and led to positive comps in August. This gave us confidence that we had reached the inflection point in our business that we had been working toward. However, we saw a tough transition into the fall seasonal business as a result of unseasonably warm weather. Story Continues This was exacerbated by an ongoing pullback in consumer discretionary spending due to sustained uncertainty in the macro environment. While we saw demand below expectations across most of our categories, our boot business, while already planned down approximately 15%, was down 27%. However, according to Circana, for Q3, footwear sales, excluding boots, remained flat to prior year in the footwear market, while DSW footwear sales, excluding boots, grew 8% versus prior year, outpacing the footwear market results. This was largely due to our athletic category continuing to comp positive throughout the quarter. Additionally, in U.S. retail, we saw growth across key categories in the quarter like women's dress, luxury, athletic, and kids. And our top eight brands, seven of which were athleisure, continued to lead the way. As we navigate through the remainder of the year, we are mindful that pressures are likely to continue. As such, we will continue to focus on those initiatives within our control and lean into areas where we are winning and the customer is shopping. I will get into the strategy in a moment, but I want to extend a sincere thank you to our employees for their diligence and commitment in applying our refresh strategy. Let me first touch on our consolidated results. In the third quarter, our sales were down 1.2% compared to last year and our comps were down 3.1% at a consolidated level. This was primarily driven by a negative 2.8% comp in our U.S. retail segment, driven by the dynamics I discussed earlier. Despite these external pressures, we continue to see our strategic priorities yielding strong results. According to Circana, for Q3, DSW footwear sales were in line with the footwear market versus last year, outpacing the market in performance and leisure footwear, as well as in dress occasion footwear. This helped to offset negative boot performance at DSW. Importantly, our adjusted operating income improved roughly 40% compared to last year, taking us to 43.6 million. Our profitability also improved sequentially as a result of ongoing expense optimization and the reversal of incentive compensation recognized in previous quarters following softer-than-expected performance. Turning to our retail business. U.S. retail sales were down 2.6% compared to last year. Comp sales were down 2.8% in the quarter, driven by continued growth in athletic and athleisure, which was more than offset by weaknesses in seasonal. We aren't the only ones who felt this weakness. According to Circana, both DSW and the footwear market were down double digits in boot sales for Q3. As we continue to evolve our assortment, seasonal still remains an area where we are significantly penetrated, therefore overly affecting our consolidated results. We noted to you last quarter that we had taken unprecedented material actions to reduce our seasonal assortment into the fall. As a result of the continued weakness we've seen, we have proactively pulled back even further on fourth quarter receipts in seasonal as part of our efforts to ensure we are moving forward with a healthy inventory position by the end of the year. Our target for the end of Q4 is to have inventory flat to up low single digits compared to last year. It is clear, more decisive actions are needed to decrease seasonal penetration on an ongoing basis. And as such, we are planning accordingly for 2025. We are committed to more aggressively leveraging consumer insights to lean into our greatest areas of differentiation. This includes prioritizing investments and focusing on areas where we know we differentiate ourselves, including our stores. As we continue to focus on executing on those things within our control, I'm going to briefly walk through our efforts against DSW's three strategic pillars in the third quarter: reinvigorating our assortment, elevating our marketing, and enhancing our omnichannel shopping experience. Starting with our assortment. Our top eight brands continue to be a primary driver of positive performance, with sales up 27% compared to the third quarter last year. As anticipated, we saw continued strength in athletic with both adults and kids growing double digits. Our athletic penetration increased by nearly 5 points versus the prior year, and we see remaining whitespace in this category. Athletic socks also continued to perform well, up triple digits. Excitingly, we also saw a positive mid-single-digit comp in women's dress. As we head into the holiday season, we have also made investments in highly giftable brands, including several that will be merchandised in our cozy shop at the front of our stores. As I'll detail shortly, we are leaning into holiday like never before at DSW, partnering with key national brand partners to be loud, exciting, and, most importantly, in stock on the most desirable brands for this time of year. Moving to marketing. Our ability to amplify our evolved assortment is more critical than ever, and our new chief marketing officer has hit the ground running. We've had a number of successes in the third quarter, including starting off strong with back-to-school season, deploying celebrities and influencers to share their picks for the season and a curated online back-to-school shopping guide to cater to the needs of students, parents, and teachers of all ages. The approach drove 26.1 billion media impressions, compared to 15 billion last year at the same time. Kicking off the fall with an omnichannel campaign titled Fall Trends that guided customers toward the trendiest styles, from over-the-knee boots to the color red to fierce animal prints and heavy metal details. The results of these efforts included 67 billion earned media impressions, the equivalent of 4 billion in advertising value, from top-tier outlets, including The Today Show, U.S. Weekly, and PureWow. Improving and enhancing our social media channels and engagement. September was a top-performing month, and we are seeing overall channel engagement up 500%, monthly engagement up 4%, and a new follower rate of nearly 7%. Paired with our enhanced influencer and content strategies, this resulted in an average of 15 million views across our social content monthly, helping our DSW brand to rise in the ranks of strategic target audiences, specifically men's and kids footwear consumers, and has improved our brand awareness ranking with these key audiences. While we believe we are early on in our journey and have more room to improve, these early signs are encouraging. And finally, bringing on a world-class brand agency, Crispin, as our new brand strategy partner, initiating robust work aimed at elevating and reenergizing DSW brand and improving overall awareness. To that end, our efforts around our third pillar, to enhance our omnichannel shopping experience for DBI customers, remain a core strategic priority. We know that roughly 70% of our customers start their search online and still go to the stores. Our stores also remain our largest source of net new customer acquisition. To fully take advantage of our omnichannel platform in the quarter, DSW leaned into being a back-to-school destination, both online and, in particular, in stores, where we established a large and impactful visual presence, with impressive and attention-grabbing collateral. So, with these new learnings, let's talk about what we are doing in the U.S. to mitigate headwinds as we move through the fourth quarter. Our team has identified that we had a significant opportunity to execute a gifting strategy this holiday. This is largely driven out of our accessories area and encompasses socks, tights, hats, and cold-weather wear. It will include a completely reimagined queue line and several updates to our gifting and impulse product offerings that can only be found in stores. This will be accompanied by creative collateral to support a gift guide, key trends, prioritized brands, and other relevant holiday messaging. We have an action-packed consumer engagement plan that will showcase great value, top trends, and the season's best giftable. And we are amplifying this with a 360-degree holiday campaign that evolves with the customer's needs throughout the extended period. While sales have been relatively in line with projections, we've seen an uptick in margins as we've become less promotional compared to last year. Turning to our Canadian business. In Canada, boots are even more impactful to our fall business, especially tactical and cold-weather boots. Extremely unseasonably warm weather led to a break in the usual third quarter trends, with boots down double digits and sandal sales up nearly 40%. Given that typical boot-buying trends in the Canadian market are so unique and historically have not been impacted by weather, we did not plan inventory down in this geography for the quarter as we did in the U.S. Therefore, we felt an outsized impact. Similar to the U.S., athletic and casual continue to post positive performance. Despite the break in the usual seasonality, the third quarter marked nine straight months of market share gains in Canada, driven by strength in kids. This quarter, we opened two new Shoe Company stores in Canada, bringing us to a net eight new store year to date, on top of the 28 Rubino stores. Now, to our brand portfolio segment. As referenced on prior earnings calls, our efforts to reduce costs, rightsize the organization, expand margins, streamline and simplify the way we work remain the top priorities in 2024. To this end, we continue to evaluate our sampling and design process to improve SKU productivity and drive margin improvement. Historically, our adoption rate of design proposals was roughly 20%, and we are energized by the significant improvement we've seen, with a 50% adoption rate for our spring '25 collection, a number we plan to take even higher over the long term. Successes in these areas led to a meaningful improvement in earnings contribution from the segment. As we look forward, we are positioned for continued growth as we build upon this foundation. We continue to be excited about the growth we are seeing in our Topo Athletic and Jessica Simpson brands specifically. Topo Athletic, up 66% in net sales for the quarter, continues to build momentum as we expand our distribution and raise product awareness, supported by our increase in marketing investments. Furthermore, there is a lot of buzz around the running category, and Topo is front and center, driving the excitement and offering customers more comfort. Jessica Simpson did well as we saw strength in our special occasion wear, with sales up 14%. As I conclude, I am pleased with the way our business has continued to execute successfully on our strategic priorities. We remain focused on continuing to create the right discipline and performance within our retail and brands businesses and are excited about our long-term path to profitable growth. I am confident the steps we are taking will set us up for improved performance over the long term as these headwinds abate. With that, I'll turn it over to Jared. Jared. Jared A. Poff -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. We continue to be pleased with the results of our investment areas that we believe will support our outperformance versus the market in those areas, even while challenges persist. Let me provide a bit more detail on our financial results from the third quarter, followed by an update to our annual guidance. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, net sales of $777 million were down 1.2% versus the prior-year period as reported and were down 3.1% on a 13-week comparable basis. In our U.S. retail segment, comps were down 2.8% in the third quarter. As mentioned, our performance was bolstered by our back-to-school season, which saw double-digit comps in athletic and kids. Unfortunately, this strong performance was more than offset by negative comps in seasonal categories. Our Canada retail segment comps were down 4.6% in the third quarter, driven by unseasonably warm weather during what is usually a heavy boot sales season, as well as continued macro challenges that have led to a reduction in overall consumer discretionary spending activity. Total sales were up double digits as a result of the addition of Rubino locations to our store base. Finally, in our brand portfolio segment, sales were up 18.5% in the third quarter. As a reminder, starting this fiscal year, we have harmonized our approach to how we transact business between our brand portfolio segment and our retail segments. This change resulted in approximately $15 million of year-over-year additional sales for our brand segment in the quarter that gets eliminated in consolidation. We saw notable strength in our DTC sites, where we have been investing. In particular, Topo.com delivered a triple-digit comp. The strength of Topo, however, was offset by a reduction at VC.com, leading to a total comp decline of 7.5% for our brand's DTC sites. Consolidated gross margin of 31.8% in the third quarter decreased 80 basis points versus the prior year, primarily driven by lower IMU as a result of our continued penetration shifts into national brands and specifically more athletic and athleisure footwear. Our adjusted SG&A was 26.7% of sales, a 220-basis-point improvement from the third quarter of last year. This was driven by expense cuts made in response to the challenged top line, including the reversal of management incentive compensation accrual in the quarter, which was slightly offset by expense deleverage as a result of top-line decline in sales. As noted last quarter, we are undertaking an expense efficiency initiative with outside consultants. Our partners have identified a number of opportunities to spend more effectively, and we now have a detailed expense savings road map that we will begin executing in 2025, and we look forward to sharing more with you in the coming quarters. For the third quarter, adjusted operating income was $43.6 million, an improvement over $31.4 million last year and the first quarterly year-over-year improvement in the last two years. In the third quarter of 2024, we had $11.6 million of net interest expense, compared to $8.8 million last year. Higher interest expense is a direct result of the term loan we installed last year, as well as higher interest rates on our ABL. We drew on our ABL in the third quarter as our team and the board deemed it prudent to continue our share repurchase activity as evidence of our conviction in our long-term strategy. To that end, we repurchased $50.6 million worth of DBI shares at an average price of $6.59 in Q3, our biggest share repurchase of the year. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter on an adjusted results was 54.8%, compared to 34.6% last year. Our third quarter adjusted net income was $14.5 million, versus $14.8 million last year, or $0.27 in diluted earnings per share, versus $0.24 last year. Turning to our inventory. We ended the third quarter with inventories up 6% versus the prior year, mostly driven by the significant lack of demand for seasonal footwear. As a result, Doug noted that we have pulled back further on fourth quarter receipts for seasonal product to ensure we are moving into a healthy inventory position by the end of the year. We ended the third quarter with $36.2 million of cash, and our total liquidity, which includes cash and availability under our ABL revolver, was $154.5 million. Total debt outstanding was $536.3 million as of the end of the third quarter. Before I conclude, I want to take a minute to discuss our fiscal 2024 guidance. Through the first half of the year, we had been signaling our confidence in an inflection point in the third quarter, a sentiment bolstered by the positive comps we saw in August as a result of our successful back-to-school efforts. However, the unseasonably warm weather in the September and October period, coupled with sustained consumer pressure, significantly dampened performance in the last two months of the quarter. As we look ahead, we feel it is prudent to give you an update on our expectations for the full 2024 results. As a reminder, our guidance includes the headwind of the sales recorded in the 53rd week of fiscal 2023, as well as the lapping of Nike's return to our assortment in the fourth quarter of 2023. Importantly, we do still continue to project our fourth quarter as our strongest comp growth quarter. Should macro conditions remain consistent to what we are seeing now, we would anticipate net sales growth for the year to be down low single digits, which incorporates the impact of the loss of the 53rd week, compared to prior guidance of flat to up slightly. We would expect external wholesale sales in our brand portfolio to be down low single digits, versus prior guidance of flattish. Additionally, despite depressed sales levels, we have been generating larger profits, and the midpoint of our guidance, excluding the impact of the 53rd week, would contemplate the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year adjusted operating income growth, leading to an annual diluted earnings per share outlook in the range of $0.10 to $0.30, versus our prior guidance of $0.50 to $0.60. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding are anticipated to be approximately 53.5 million for the third quarter and approximately 55.4 million for the full year given the share repurchase activity that has occurred thus far throughout the year. At this time, we would like to reaffirm our expectations for capital expenditures to be in the range of $60 million to $65 million for the year. Our estimates also assume an effective tax rate of roughly 32%. I remain confident that our outlined initiatives will continue to deliver improved performance over time. Remaining focused on our core business strategy throughout the holidays will position us for stronger performance over the long term as these external challenges ease. With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator. Questions & Answers: Operator Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question today comes from Dylan Carden from William Blair. Please go ahead with your question. Dylan Carden -- Analyst Thanks. Jared, sorry if you mentioned this, November trends or just trends generally once the weather kind of cooperated, did you provide that? Jared A. Poff -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer Yeah. What we said is what we're -- what the midpoint of our guidance implies. And to be perfectly honest, I would, you know, say it's indicated or informed by the November trends we're seeing. And on the -- on kind of through the holiday, what we saw was overall demand slightly below last year, but it was distorted. Stores were actually positive, digital, because we were not chasing excess boot inventory like we were last year. So, very different targeted promotions was below last year. But gross margin dollars and rate, obviously, were well above last year, and we're seeing that trend continue. So, our midpoint of the guidance kind of incorporates all of that. Dylan Carden -- Analyst Great. Thank you. And then kind of related to that, are you losing share in boots? I mean, you know, the industry was also down double digits. You were down I think you said 27%. And you care. And I guess sort of the implied question in that is, you know, is it sort of a waterbed effect at this point where you're kind of seeing gains elsewhere but losses in other places and kind of keeping you at a net disadvantage position until you get the assortment in a better sort of mix? Doug Howe -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. This is Doug, Dylan. Thanks for your question. You know, we consciously planned the category down, as we mentioned, 15%. It was almost double that decrease. I mean, we are going to be very strategic about continuing to kind of de-weatherize the business obviously. So, you know, we're still working through the level of what that would look like. Fourth quarter is actually even a higher percent of our business in the boot category, obviously, than Q3. And, you know, we have seen a bit of a rebound with the weather as we move through the quarter. And then as Jared said, we've been particularly pleased with how we've seen that show up in our stores. I think the assortment work that the teams are doing, I would give credit to that, as well as the marketing and messaging. We really showed up for holiday with messaging in our stores. So, that's been favorable as well. But again, we're going to continue to be conservative on the seasonal categories, as we've stated. Dylan Carden -- Analyst And then to that point, you're not leaving money on the table here by sort of overcorrecting for boots as the weather has turned I guess would be one thought. Doug Howe -- Chief Executive Officer No, we don't believe so at all. I mean, we still saw a slight decrease in traffic, right? So, that's why we're excited about the marketing that we'll be leaning into in a more aggressive way for next year with regards to just driving that traffic, but not leaving business on the table at all. Dylan Carden -- Analyst Awesome. Thank you. Doug Howe -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Mauricio Serna from UBS. Please go ahead with your question. Mauricio Serna -- Analyst Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to hear because -- sorry if I missed it. Did you talk about what was your performance in -- across your top eight national brands, what are you seeing there? And also, if you mentioned what was your quarter-to-date trend? And also -- and on the other hand, on the balance sheet, you saw -- you know, in cash flow, you saw like -- you mentioned you did your biggest share repurchase of the year. How are you thinking about, you know, debt levels management considering that, you know, I guess, like, the business has been a little bit more challenged than expected? Doug Howe -- Chief Executive Officer Hi, Mauricio. This is Doug. Thanks for your question. I'll take the first two on the brand performance and then quarter to date, and then I'll turn it over to Jared for the debt. Yeah, we did share the performance of the top eight brands. They were up 27% in Q3. It was roughly about 40% of the total. Really proud of the work the team has done on really going out to the relationships with those top brands. Being mindful also that we're not becoming overly reliant on any of them. Think about 40% penetration on eight brands. None of them are, you know, close to 10% of the business. So, we think that's a very thoughtful approach. Quarter to date, as Jared said a couple of moments ago, is in line with the guidance that we're providing. Again, we saw a little bit of softness in Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but we're seeing an expansion in margin dollars, and that's continuing as we move through December as well, largely due to the fact that we're not as promotional as we were last year because we're in a much better position on inventory. Jared A. Poff -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer And on kind of debt level management, you know, what we always look at is more of a liquidity management. We've got two big working capital cycles a year. We're actually on the cash generation side of one of those cycles happening right now, very, very typical and cyclical. We are comfortable with our overall debt levels and, more importantly, comfortable with our liquidity levels. You know, I would say, obviously, we want to remain cautious as we just look at the consumer environment out in the future. So, you know, we feel like we've got our capital structure in the right place right now but always have an eye on that. And certainly, also an eye on to the interest load that it brings. Mauricio Serna -- Analyst Got it. Very helpful. And then just could you provide any details on what you've seen with Nike? I remember, like, you were very excited about, you know, new -- just having more product available from that brand this year than even when you had the brand, you know, a few years before. Doug Howe -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. This is Doug. I mean, we continue to be very pleased with the Nike performance. They couldn't be better partners. Really encouraged. I mean, still a net new positive for us. We have now lapped when they came back to DSW specifically. But again, couldn't be more pleased with the business and the relationship. They've been great partners. Mauricio Serna -- Analyst Got it. Thank you very much. Doug Howe -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, in showing no additional questions, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Doug Howe for closing remarks. Doug Howe -- Chief Executive Officer I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you as we continue to make progress on our strategic priorities going forward. Thanks again for joining us. Operator [Operator signoff] Duration: 0 minutes Call participants: Dustin Hauenstein -- Senior Vice President, Finance Doug Howe -- Chief Executive Officer Jared A.

2024, 3:55 PM 3 min read In This Article: DBI -6.16% Designer Brands (DBI) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.27 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.35 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.24 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -22.86%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this footwear and accessories retailer would post earnings of $0.56 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.29, delivering a surprise of -48.21%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once. Designer Brands , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry, posted revenues of $777.19 million for the quarter ended October 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.15%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $786.33 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Designer Brands shares have lost about 34.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 26.9%. What's Next for Designer Brands? While Designer Brands has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Designer Brands: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for the stock.

DBI -6.16% Designer Brands (NYSE:DBI) Misses Q3 Sales Targets, Stock Drops 19.6% Footwear and accessories discount retailer Designer Brands (NYSE:DBI) fell short of the market\u2019s revenue expectations in Q3 CY2024, with sales falling 1.2% year on year to $777.2 million. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.27 per share was 23.5% below analysts\u2019 consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Designer Brands? Find out in our full research report . Designer Brands (DBI) Q3 CY2024 Highlights: Revenue: $777.2 million vs analyst estimates of $802.1 million (1.2% year-on-year decline, 3.1% miss) Adjusted EPS: $0.27 vs analyst expectations of $0.35 (23.5% miss) Management lowered its full-year Adjusted EPS guidance to $0.20 at the midpoint, a 63.6% decrease Operating Margin: 2.9%, in line with the same quarter last year Locations: 675 at quarter end, up from 643 in the same quarter last year Same-Store Sales fell 3.1% year on year (-9.3% in the same quarter last year) Market Capitalization: $321.3 million Doug Howe, Chief Executive Officer stated, \"The third quarter started strong, driven by back-to-school season and the success of our athletic and athleisure offerings, bolstering our confidence that we had reached a turning point in our business. However, we had a difficult transition into the fall season, with unseasonably warm weather and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty placing pressure on consumer discretionary spending, specifically in our seasonal category. As a result, we saw our total Company comparable sales decline 3.1% for the quarter. According to Circana, footwear sales excluding boots remained flat to prior year in the footwear market while U.S. Retail segment sales excluding boots grew 8% versus prior year, outpacing the footwear market results. This gives us further confidence that we are investing our time and resources into the right areas as we continue to transform our business.\" Company Overview Founded in 1969 as a shoe importer and distributor, Designer Brands (NYSE:DBI) is an American discount retailer focused on footwear and accessories. Footwear Retailer Footwear sales\u2013like their apparel counterparts\u2013are driven by seasons, trends, and innovation more so than absolute need and similarly face the bigger-picture secular trend of e-commerce penetration. Footwear plays a part in societal belonging, personal expression, and occasion, and retailers selling shoes recognize this. Therefore, they aim to balance selection, competitive prices, and the latest trends to attract consumers. Unlike their apparel counterparts, footwear retailers most sell popular third-party brands (as opposed to their own exclusive brands), which could mean less exclusivity of product but more nimbleness to pivot to what\u2019s hot. Story Continues Sales Growth A company\u2019s long-term sales performance signals its overall quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Designer Brands is a small retailer, which sometimes brings disadvantages compared to larger competitors benefiting from economies of scale and negotiating leverage. As you can see below, Designer Brands\u2019s revenue declined by 2.7% per year over the last five years (we compare to 2019 to normalize for COVID-19 impacts) despite opening new stores. This implies its underperformance was driven by lower sales at existing, established locations. Designer Brands Quarterly Revenue This quarter, Designer Brands missed Wall Street\u2019s estimates and reported a rather uninspiring 1.2% year-on-year revenue decline, generating $777.2 million of revenue. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 2.7% over the next 12 months. While this projection suggests its newer products will fuel better top-line performance, it is still below the sector average. Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) stock benefiting from the rise of AI.

It has opened new stores quickly over the last two years by averaging 1.7% annual growth, faster than the broader consumer retail sector. When a retailer opens new stores, it usually means it\u2019s investing for growth because demand is greater than supply, especially in areas where consumers may not have a store within reasonable driving distance. Designer Brands Operating Locations Same-Store Sales A company's store base only paints one part of the picture. When demand is high, it makes sense to open more. But when demand is low, it\u2019s prudent to close some locations and use the money in other ways. Same-store sales provides a deeper understanding of this issue because it measures organic growth at brick-and-mortar shops for at least a year. Designer Brands\u2019s demand has been shrinking over the last two years as its same-store sales have averaged 6.1% annual declines. This performance is concerning - it shows Designer Brands artificially boosts its revenue by building new stores. We\u2019d like to see a company\u2019s same-store sales rise before it takes on the costly, capital-intensive endeavor of expanding its store base. Designer Brands Same-Store Sales Growth In the latest quarter, Designer Brands\u2019s same-store sales fell by 3.1% year on year. This decrease represents a further deceleration from its historical levels. We hope the business can get back on track. Key Takeaways from Designer Brands\u2019s Q3 Results We struggled to find many resounding positives in these results. Its revenue missed on a same-store sales decline. Full-year EPS guidance was lowered and\u00a0missed significantly. Overall, this was a very bad quarter. The stock traded down 19.6% to $4.65 immediately following the results. Designer Brands didn\u2019t show it\u2019s best hand this quarter, but does that create an opportunity to buy the stock right now? When making that decision, it\u2019s important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

Limited's (ASX:DBI) ROE Can Tell Us editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Mon, Dec 23, 2024, 5:23 AM 3 min read In This Article: DBI.AX -1.94% One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine Dalrymple Bay Infrastructure Limited ( ASX:DBI ), by way of a worked example. ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Dalrymple Bay Infrastructure How Is ROE Calculated? The formula for ROE is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Dalrymple Bay Infrastructure is: 6.9% = AU$77m \u00f7 AU$1.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024). The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every A$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated A$0.07 in profit. Does Dalrymple Bay Infrastructure Have A Good ROE? Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. You can see in the graphic below that Dalrymple Bay Infrastructure has an ROE that is fairly close to the average for the Infrastructure industry (6.9%). ASX:DBI Return on Equity December 23rd 2024 That's neither particularly good, nor bad. Although the ROE is similar to the industry, we should still perform further checks to see if the company's ROE is being boosted by high debt levels. If so, this increases its exposure to financial risk. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Dalrymple Bay Infrastructure visit our risks dashboard for free. How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity? Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used. Combining Dalrymple Bay Infrastructure's Debt And Its 6.9% Return On Equity It's worth noting the high use of debt by Dalrymple Bay Infrastructure, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 2.25. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time. Story Continues Conclusion Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better. But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results PR Newswire Tue, Dec 10, 2024, 2:45 PM 22 min read In This Article: DBI -6.16% According to Circana, U.S. Retail segment footwear sales were inline with the market with key categories outpacing the market including performance, leisure footwear, and dress occasion footwear during the quarter, which helped to partially offset negative boot performance COLUMBUS, Ohio , Dec. 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Designer Brands Inc. (NYSE: DBI) (the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" and \"Designer Brands\"), one of the world's largest designers, producers, and retailers of footwear and accessories, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended November 2, 2024 . (PRNewsfoto/Designer Brands Inc.) Doug Howe , Chief Executive Officer stated, \"The third quarter started strong, driven by back-to-school season and the success of our athletic and athleisure offerings, bolstering our confidence that we had reached a turning point in our business. However, we had a difficult transition into the fall season, with unseasonably warm weather and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty placing pressure on consumer discretionary spending, specifically in our seasonal category. As a result, we saw our total Company comparable sales decline 3.1% for the quarter. According to Circana, footwear sales excluding boots remained flat to prior year in the footwear market while U.S. Retail segment sales excluding boots grew 8% versus prior year, outpacing the footwear market results. This gives us further confidence that we are investing our time and resources into the right areas as we continue to transform our business.\" Howe continued, \"Although external challenges have persisted, I am encouraged by how effectively our business has stayed aligned with our strategic priorities and executing on the things within our control. As we make our way through the fourth quarter, we remain confident in our strategy and our ability to navigate headwinds as we implement a refreshed holiday marketing and merchandising approach. We continue to believe this focus will help us improve performance over the long-term.\" Third Quarter Operating Results (Unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are to the third quarter of 2023) Net sales decreased 1.2% to $777.2 million . Total comparable sales decreased by 3.1%. Gross profit decreased to $247.4 million versus $256.4 million last year, and gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 31.8% compared to 32.6% last year. Reported net income attributable to Designer Brands Inc. was $13.0 million , or diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") of $0.24 . Adjusted net income was $14.5 million , or adjusted diluted EPS of $0.27 . Story Continues Liquidity Cash and cash equivalents totaled $36.2 million at the end of the third quarter of 2024, compared to $54.6 million at the end of the same period last year, with $118.3 million available for borrowings under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility. Debt totaled $536.3 million at the end of the third quarter of 2024 compared to $375.5 million at the end of the same period last year. The Company ended the third quarter with inventories of $637.0 million compared to $601.5 million at the end of the same period last year. Return to Shareholders During the third quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased 7.7 million Class A common shares at an aggregate cost of $50.6 million . As of November 2, 2024 , $19.7 million of Class A common shares remained available for repurchase under the Board-approved share repurchase program. A dividend of $0.05 per share for both Class A and Class B common shares will be paid on December 20, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 6, 2024 . Store Openings and Closings During the third quarter of 2024, the Company closed three stores in the United States (\"U.S.\") and opened two stores in Canada , resulting in a total of 496 stores in the U.S. and 179 stores in Canada as of November 2, 2024 . Updated 2024 Financial Outlook The Company has updated the following guidance for the full year 2024: Metric Previous Guidance Current Guidance Designer Brands Net Sales Growth Flat to low-single digits Down low single digits Adjusted Diluted EPS $0.50 - $0.60 $0.10 - $0.30 Forward-looking adjusted diluted EPS for 2024 excludes potential charges or gains that may be recorded during the fiscal year, including among other things: (1) restructuring and integration costs, including severance charges; (2) acquisition-related costs; (3) impairment charges; (4) foreign currency transaction losses (gains); (5) the net tax impact of such items; (6) the change in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets; and (7) net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest. A reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP earnings guidance to the comparable GAAP measure is not provided, as permitted by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K, because the impact and timing of these potential charges or gains is inherently uncertain and difficult to predict and is unavailable without unreasonable efforts. In addition, the Company believes that such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors. Such items are uncertain and could have a substantial impact on GAAP measures of our financial performance.

These measures adjust for the effects of: (1) CEO transition costs; (2) restructuring and integration costs, including severance charges; (3) acquisition-related costs; (4) impairment charges; (5) foreign currency transaction losses (gains); (6) the net tax impact of such items (which reflects the determination based on with adjustments and without adjustments approach), including discrete and permanent tax on non-deductible CEO transition costs; (7) the change in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets; and (8) net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest. The unaudited adjusted results should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with GAAP. These financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to both management and investors to increase comparability to prior periods by adjusting for certain items that may not be indicative of core operating measures and to better identify trends in our business. The adjusted financial results are used by management to, and allow investors to, evaluate the operating performance of the Company compared to prior periods, when reviewed in conjunction with the Company's GAAP statements. These amounts are not determined in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be used exclusively in evaluating the Company's business and operations. Comparable Sales Performance Metric We consider the percent change in comparable sales from the same previous year period, a primary metric commonly used throughout the retail industry, to be an important measurement for management and investors of the performance of our direct-to-consumer businesses. We include in our comparable sales metric sales from stores in operation for at least 14 months at the beginning of the applicable year. Stores are added to the comparable base at the beginning of the year and are dropped for comparative purposes in the quarter in which they are closed. Comparable sales include the e-commerce sales of the U.S. Retail and Canada Retail segments. For calculating comparable sales in 2024, periods in 2023 are shifted by one week to compare similar calendar weeks. Comparable sales for the Canada Retail segment exclude the impact of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current period results at the foreign currency exchange rate used in the comparable period of the prior year. Stores added as a result of the Rubino acquisition that will have been in operation for at least 14 months at the beginning of 2025, along with its e-commerce sales, will be added to the comparable base for the Canada Retail segment beginning with the second quarter of 2025. Comparable sales include the e-commerce net sales of the Brand Portfolio segment from the direct-to-consumer e-commerce sites. The calculation of comparable sales varies across the retail industry and, as a result, the calculations of other retail companies may not be consistent with our calculation.
