The Company expects its preliminary full-year 2024 product revenue to be $180.3 million, exceeding the Company\u2019s 2024 product revenue guidance range of $177-$179 million. Included in the full-year preliminary 2024 product revenue results were $9.2 million of IFC revenue, representing growth of 42% over 2023 results. These preliminary product revenue results have not been audited and are therefore subject to change. \"We are pleased with our strong performance, which contributed to continued double-digit product revenue growth for the full year 2024, driven by sustained momentum across our INTERCEPT platelet franchise both in the U.S. and internationally and importantly, from our IFC business, which continues to gain momentum,\" said William \"Obi\" Greenman, president and chief executive officer of Cerus. \"As we look ahead to 2025, we are excited to build on this success through disciplined execution, continued growth in the platelet and IFC franchises, and the advancement of our pipeline, including the planned upcoming LED Illuminator launch in Europe, as well as anticipated further geographic expansion.\" The Company expects full-year 2025 product revenue will be in the range of $194-$200 million, of which IFC is expected to be in the range of $12-$15 million. Year-over-year product revenue growth for the first quarter of 2025 is expected to be approximately 10% to 15% over the first quarter of 2024. \"With our strong preliminary top-line results, we continue to strengthen our financial position to support future growth initiatives,\" Greenman added. Cerus will provide complete fourth quarter and full-year 2024 financial results and host a call to discuss both 2024 results and 2025 expectations later this quarter.

the impact of legislative or regulatory healthcare reforms that may make it more difficult and costly for Cerus to produce, market and distribute its products; risks related to future opportunities and plans, including the uncertainty of Cerus\u2019 future capital requirements and its future revenues and other financial performance and results, including as it relates to Cerus\u2019 2025 annual product revenue guidance as well as its expectations for year-over-year product revenue growth for the first quarter of 2025; as well as other risks detailed in Cerus\u2019 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in Cerus\u2019 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, filed with the SEC on October 30, 2024.

Zacks Equity Research Mon, Dec 2, 2024, 4:53 PM 4 min read In This Article: ITRI Itron ITRI recently teamed up with Jemena \u2014 a major Australian provider of gas and electricity services. Together, they are deploying Itron\u2019s Low Voltage Distributed Energy Resource Management System (LV DERMS) to manage rooftop solar generation, enhance energy system resilience and address the challenges posed by Australia's growing solar penetration. The LV DERMS was launched in March 2024 at the Energy Networks Conference in Adelaide, Australia. This solution ensures stability in the low-voltage network while managing consumer energy resources (CERs) like rooftop solar and battery storage. It aims to tackle the challenges of grid instability caused by the ongoing energy transition. The collaboration finds relevance in the Victorian Government's new solar energy mandate, effective since Oct. 1, 2024. The regulation mandates that all newly installed or upgraded rooftop solar systems must be equipped with a utility-compatible inverter and a stable Internet connection. This allows utilities to actively monitor and manage minimum energy demand. During periods of excess solar generation, LV DERMS allows Jemena, under the supervision of the Australian Energy Market Operator (\u201cAEMO\u201d), to remotely cut back solar power generation. This feature complies with Victoria's requirements, providing a simple, cost-effective and secure solution to AEMO's low-voltage network stability challenges. Itron, Inc.

{"text": "Diamond Estates Wines & Spirits Reports Q2 2025 Financial Results Newsfile Corp. Fri, Nov 29, 2024, 4:33 AM 9 min read In This Article: DWWEF Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - November 28, 2024) - Diamond Estates Wines & Spirits Inc. (TSXV: DWS) (\"Diamond Estates\" or \"the Company\") today announced its financial results of position for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 (\"Q2 2025 and \"YTD 2025\" respectively). Q2 2025 Summary: Revenue for Q2 2025 was $7.7 million, a decrease of $0.1 million from $7.8 million in Q2 2024. The Winery division experienced an increase in sales of $2.4 million while the Agency division experienced a decrease of $2.4 million. The increase in sales in the Winery division is largely attributable to $0.9 from DPTB, $0.5 million increase of all other brands and the remainder is from the VQA wine support program. The increase in sales is a direct result of the Ontario's government announcement to expand the marketplace to convenience, grocery and big-box stores. The decrease in the Agency division was primarily driven by the loss of a key supplier in the prior year in the amount of $2.1 million and the sale of Western Canada operations to Renaissance in August, 2024; Gross margin 1 as a percentage of revenue grew to 53.9% for Q2 2025 compared to 39.6% in Q2 2024 and gross margin increased $1.1 million, from $3.1 million in Q2 2024 to $4.2 million for Q2 2025. The Winery division experienced an increase of $1.5 million while the Agency declined by $0.4 million. The gross margin in the Winery division increased from 43.7% in Q2 2024 to 51.0% in Q2 2025 as a result of the VQA Wine support program and general margin increases across various skus. The gross margin at the Agency increased from 33.9% in Q2 2024 to 76.4% in Q2 2025 with the sale of Western Canada operations to Renaissance in August, 2024 and the increase in commissions sales compared to third party wines and spirits; EBITDA1 increased by $2.0 million to positive $1.0 million in Q2 2025 from a negative $1.0 million in Q2 2024. Adjusted EBITDA1 increased by $1.3 million to positive $0.5 million in Q2 2025 from a negative $0.8 million in Q2 2024. Both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA increases are attributed to improving gross margins in the Winery division and an overall decrease in SG&A expenses of $0.2 million compared to the prior year; and Net income was $0.2 million, compared to a net loss of $2.3 million in Q2 2024. Subsequent Events: In October, 2024, the Company signed an agreement to receive the $841,000 under the Winery Sector Support program, none of which has been accrued as of September 30, 2024; In October, 2024, the Company closed on the acquisition of certain assets from the Perigon Beverage Group (\"Perigon\"). More specifically, Diamond has purchased the agency and supplier contracts, the intellectual property, and other intangible assets of Perigon and its agency business, such as its website, customer lists, business names and inventory. The purchase price is $1.8 million based on Perigon's latest financial results and will be satisfied by the issuance of common shares of Diamond over the next eighteen months; On November 11, 2024, the Company replaced the $4.759 million of 2023 Replacement Debentures with new debentures (the \"2024 Replacement Debentures\"). The material terms of the 2024 Replacement Debentures are the same as the 2023 Replacement Debentures, other than (i) the conversion price, which is now $0.24, and (ii) the maturity date, which is now November 9, 2025; and In November, 2024, the Company entered into a further amendment to its Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"SARCA\") with Bank of Montreal (\"BMO\"), the notable terms of which were (i) the establishment of a non-revolving credit facility in the amount of $2,500,000 (\"Demand NRT Facility\") (ii) The non-revolving term credit facility previously available in the amount of $8.7 million has been reduced to $3.0 million, and (iii) a limited recourse guarantee granted by Lassonde Industries Inc. in favour of BMO on the Demand NRT Facility.

Mon, Dec 2, 2024, 2:00 AM 4 min read In This Article: ITRI Itron, Inc. Data-Driven Solution to Enable Jemena, at AEMO\u2019s Direction, to Remotely Manage Consumer Energy Resources for Energy System Reliability LIBERTY LAKE, Wash., Dec. 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Itron, Inc. (NASDAQ: ITRI), which is innovating new ways for utilities and cities to manage energy and water, is collaborating with Jemena , a provider of gas and electricity services to millions of customers in Australia, to deploy Itron\u2019s Low Voltage Distributed Energy Resource Management System (LV DERMS) to manage rooftop solar generation and enhance resiliency within the energy system. The innovative data-driven and flexible solution transforms the planning and operating risks caused by consumer energy resources (CERs), specifically solar, into opportunities. LV DERMS will help address challenges stemming from the integration of CER into the low voltage network with real-time insights to enable operational decisions. Following the emergency solar backstop mechanism mandated by the Victorian Government, from Oct. 1, 2024, all new or upgraded rooftop solar systems must have a utility compatible inverter and reliable internet connection that will allow utilities to manage minimum demand. The Itron LV DERMS solution enables Jemena, at the direction of the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), to remotely curtail solar power generation when supply and demand imbalances occur within the electricity grid. This capability ensures compliance with the Victoria mandate and offers an easy-to-install, cost-effective and secure solution for addressing stability challenges faced by AEMO, which stem from the low voltage distribution network. Itron\u2019s LV DERMS allows Jemena to continuously collect and process secure solar system generation data from all new rooftop solar connected to the system from Oct. 1, 2024. Near real-time information provides Jemena with visibility into the energy levels in their distribution network to respond and prevent grid instability caused by excess generation within the energy system. When Jemena moderates solar input to the grid to ensure grid reliability, customer electricity supply will continue uninterrupted. Itron\u2019s LV DERMS offers a seamless deployment with Jemena\u2019s existing back-office systems, delivering a complete view of the electricity network performance. \u201cAcross Jemena\u2019s electricity distribution network, we are seeing more customers adopt solar panels, electric vehicles and other technologies than ever before. While solar generation is beneficial to customers and a sustainable way to power homes, excess solar power can cause supply-demand imbalance within the energy system and potentially overload it,\u201d said Georgia Cronin, General Manager Customer & Energy Solutions at Jemena . \u201cItron\u2019s LV DERMS helps us manage minimum demand and contributes to keeping the lights on for our customers.\u201d Story Continues \u201cMaximizing the contribution of consumer energy resources (CERs) is key to meeting Australia\u2019s climate goals, and with rooftop solar at 30% penetration, it\u2019s growing faster than any other renewable sources across the continent. Australia recognizes the risks to the energy system from rooftop solar and is leading the industry as they implement mandates to prepare for the future of CERs,\u201d said Alex Beveridge, Itron\u2019s director of sales for APAC . \u201cDesigned specifically for the Australian market, our LV DERMS not only addresses the stability challenges facing the energy system but will also help Jemena better understand capacity constraints within the electricity distribution network. With Itron\u2019s solutions already integrated at the edge of many Australian utility providers\u2019 Advanced Metering Infrastructures (AMI) networks, deploying Itron\u2019s LV DERMS provides a cost-effective and streamlined approach, as seen with Jemena.\u201d To learn how Australia is optimizing CERs to meet the country\u2019s net-zero future, join the Smart Energy International webcast featuring spokespeople from Itron and Jemena on Tuesday, Dec. 3 at 3:00 p.m. AEDT or on Monday, Dec. 2 at 8:00 p.m. PST here .
