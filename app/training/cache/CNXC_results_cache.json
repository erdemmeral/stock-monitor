[{"text": "Is Invesco S&P MidCap 400 Pure Value ETF (RFV) a Strong ETF Right Now? Zacks Equity Research Wed, Jan 22, 2025, 2:20 PM 4 min read The Invesco S&P MidCap 400 Pure Value ETF (RFV) was launched on 03/01/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Style Box - Mid Cap Value category of the market. What Are Smart Beta ETFs? The ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes, a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment. Market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency. However, some investors believe in the possibility of beating the market through exceptional stock selection, and choose a different type of fund that tracks non-cap weighted strategies: smart beta. By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such. Even though this space provides many choices to investors--think one of the simplest methodologies like equal-weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting--not all have been able to deliver first-rate results. Fund Sponsor & Index The fund is managed by Invesco, and has been able to amass over $285.33 million, which makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Style Box - Mid Cap Value. RFV, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the S&P MidCap 400 Pure Value Index. The S&P MidCap 400 Pure Value Index measures the performance of securities that exhibit strong value characteristics in the S&P MidCap 400 Index. Cost & Other Expenses When considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal. Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.35% for this ETF, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space. It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 0.93%. Sector Exposure and Top Holdings ETFs offer diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk, but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis. This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Consumer Discretionary sector - about 26.70% of the portfolio. Industrials and Energy round out the top three. Taking into account individual holdings, Concentrix Corp (CNXC) accounts for about 3.52% of the fund's total assets, followed by Hf Sinclair Corp (DINO) and Pbf Energy Inc (PBF). Story Continues Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 26.86% of RFV's total assets under management. Performance and Risk The ETF has added roughly 5.65% so far this year and is up about 16.91% in the last one year (as of 01/22/2025). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $108.97 and $131.23. The fund has a beta of 1.36 and standard deviation of 21.78% for the trailing three-year period, which makes RFV a high risk choice in this particular space. With about 89 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk. Alternatives Invesco S&P MidCap 400 Pure Value ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Mid Cap Value segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider. IShares Russell Mid-Cap Value ETF (IWS) tracks Russell MidCap Value Index and the Vanguard Mid-Cap Value ETF (VOE) tracks CRSP U.S. Mid Cap Value Index. IShares Russell Mid-Cap Value ETF has $14.17 billion in assets, Vanguard Mid-Cap Value ETF has $18.04 billion. IWS has an expense ratio of 0.23% and VOE charges 0.07%. Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Mid Cap Value.

S&P MidCap 400 Pure Value ETF (RFV) Be on Your Investing Radar? Zacks Equity Research Mon, Jan 20, 2025, 2:20 PM 3 min read The Invesco S&P MidCap 400 Pure Value ETF (RFV) was launched on 03/01/2006, and is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Mid Cap Value segment of the US equity market. The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $282.54 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Value segment of the US equity market. Why Mid Cap Value Compared to large and small cap companies, mid cap businesses tend to have higher growth prospects and are less volatile, respectively, with market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion. Thus they have a nice balance of growth potential and stability. Carrying lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, value stocks also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. When you look at long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets. But in strong bull markets, growth stocks are more likely to be winners. Costs Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same. Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.35%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space. It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.94%. Sector Exposure and Top Holdings Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis. This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Consumer Discretionary sector--about 26.90% of the portfolio. Industrials and Energy round out the top three. Looking at individual holdings, Concentrix Corp (CNXC) accounts for about 3.52% of total assets, followed by Hf Sinclair Corp (DINO) and Pbf Energy Inc (PBF). The top 10 holdings account for about 26.86% of total assets under management. Performance and Risk RFV seeks to match the performance of the S&P MidCap 400 Pure Value Index before fees and expenses. The S&P MidCap 400 Pure Value Index measures the performance of securities that exhibit strong value characteristics in the S&P MidCap 400 Index. The ETF return is roughly 4.40% so far this year and it's up approximately 17.16% in the last one year (as of 01/20/2025). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $108.97 and $131.23. The ETF has a beta of 1.36 and standard deviation of 21.86% for the trailing three-year period, making it a high risk choice in the space. With about 89 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk. Story Continues Alternatives Invesco S&P MidCap 400 Pure Value ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, RFV is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Mid Cap Value area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space. The iShares Russell Mid-Cap Value ETF (IWS) and the Vanguard Mid-Cap Value ETF (VOE) track a similar index. While iShares Russell Mid-Cap Value ETF has $14.08 billion in assets, Vanguard Mid-Cap Value ETF has $17.86 billion. IWS has an expense ratio of 0.23% and VOE charges 0.07%. Bottom-Line Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.

Positive Points Concentrix Corp ( NASDAQ:CNXC ) achieved a high client revenue retention rate of approximately 99% in fiscal 2024. The company has successfully integrated Webhelp, resulting in ongoing net synergy benefits expected to show in 2025 and beyond. Concentrix Corp ( NASDAQ:CNXC ) has expanded its offerings with new solutions like data annotation, AI design, and cybersecurity, contributing nearly $1 billion in revenue in 2024. The company has a strong pipeline of new clients in Europe following the Webhelp integration, indicating potential for future growth. Concentrix Corp ( NASDAQ:CNXC ) has a robust free cash flow generation, allowing for debt reduction and increased shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. Negative Points Revenue growth was modest at 1.5% on a pro forma constant currency basis for Q4, reflecting challenges in some verticals. Non-GAAP operating income margin decreased due to increased technology spend and upfront investments in transformational wins. The company faces headwinds from ongoing decreases in revenue from North American communications clients. There is a continued decline in low complexity transactions, which could impact revenue growth in the short term. Concentrix Corp ( NASDAQ:CNXC ) anticipates a negative impact from foreign exchange rates on revenue growth in 2025. Story Continues Q & A Highlights Q : Can you provide some commentary on the revenue headwind from less complex work and any geographic delivery mix changes? A : Christopher Caldwell, President and CEO, explained that they expect to reduce low-value transactions by 1% to 2% in 2025, which will be a headwind. Additionally, there is a shift from Europe to Africa and Eastern Europe, and from North America to offshore locations, driven by cost considerations. Q : Could you update us on the large transformational win and its impact on revenue and P&L in 2025? A : Christopher Caldwell noted that revenue from the large transformational deal will start to be meaningful in the third and fourth quarters of 2025. Smaller transformational deals will begin generating revenue in Q2 and Q3, with more impact in the latter half of the year. Q : Are companies starting to reinvest in service due to consumer pushback against automation? A : Christopher Caldwell observed that in certain industries like BFSI and high-value goods, there is a pushback leading to more outsourcing. However, in sectors like telecom and consumer electronics, this trend is less evident. Companies aiming to differentiate are outsourcing more tech and customer experience services. Q : How is the digital CX or Catalyst business performing, and what are the growth expectations for fiscal 2025? A : Christopher Caldwell stated that the Catalyst business, representing about 8% of total revenue, is growing well at mid to high single digits. It is expected to continue this growth trajectory as more partner implementations are added. Q : What are the priorities for cash in fiscal 2025, and how will you balance reinvestment, M&A, and buybacks? A : Andre Valentine, CFO, emphasized the focus on organic growth investment, debt reduction, and capital return to shareholders. The company plans to increase share repurchases modestly above the $136 million in fiscal 2024, continue dividends, and move closer to their target leverage ratio.

Non-GAAP operating income of $1,317.9 million, or 13.7% of revenue, compared with $1,010.0 million, or 14.2% of revenue, in the prior fiscal year. Adjusted EBITDA of $1,554.9 million, or 16.2% of revenue, compared with $1,181.8 million, or 16.6% of revenue, in the prior fiscal year. Cash flow from operations was $667.5 million in the fiscal year. Adjusted free cash flow for the fiscal year was $474.5 million. Diluted EPS was $3.71 compared to $5.70 in the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $11.42 compared to $11.45 in the prior fiscal year. Returned approximately $220 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while reducing debt by approximately $209 million. Quarterly Dividend and Share Repurchase Program: The Company paid a $0.33275 per share quarterly dividend on November 5, 2024. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.33275 per share payable on February 11, 2025, to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 31, 2025. The Company repurchased 0.7 million shares in the fourth quarter at a cost of $34.0 million under its previously announced share repurchase program at an average cost of $49.46 per share. In addition, the Board of Directors has extended the Company\u2019s share repurchase program by authorizing an increase of the amount remaining for share repurchases under the program to $600 million. First Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2025 Outlook: The following statements are based on the Company\u2019s current expectations for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2025. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of acquisition-related and integration expenses, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation, share-based compensation, and the related tax effects thereon. The non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes no impact from changes in acquisition contingent consideration and foreign currency losses (gains), net included in other expense (income), net. These statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Expectations: First quarter reported revenue of $2.355 billion to $2.370 billion. Based on current exchange rates, our expectations assume approximately a 200-basis point negative impact of foreign exchange rates compared with the prior year period. Our guidance implies constant currency revenue growth for the first quarter in the range of 0% to 0.75%. Operating income of $137 million to $147 million and non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $305 million to $315 million. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.49 to $2.64, assuming approximately 64.1 million diluted common shares outstanding and approximately 5% of net income attributable to participating securities. The effective tax rate is expected to approximate 25.5% to 26.5%. Full Year 2025 Expectations: Full year reported revenue of $9.470 billion to $9.610 billion. Based on current exchange rates, our expectations assume approximately a 150-basis point negative impact of foreign exchange rates compared with the prior year. Our guidance implies constant currency revenue growth for the full year in the range of 0% to 1.5%. Operating income of $663 million to $703 million and non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $1,300 million to $1,340 million. Non-GAAP EPS of $11.18 to $11.77, assuming approximately 63.6 million diluted common shares outstanding and approximately 5% of net income attributable to participating securities. The effective tax rate is expected to approximate 25.5% to 26.5%. In addition, the Company expects to generate approximately $625 million to $650 million of adjusted free cash flow in fiscal year 2025. The Company believes that a quantitative reconciliation of the non-GAAP EPS outlook to the most directly comparable GAAP measure cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to (a) the inability to forecast future changes in acquisition contingent consideration, which is based, in part, on the future trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock, and (b) the inability to forecast future foreign currency losses (gains), net included in other expense (income), net. For the same reason, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which may have a material impact on the Company\u2019s GAAP results. The Company believes that a quantitative reconciliation of the adjusted free cash flow outlook to the most directly comparable GAAP measure cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to uncertainty related to the future changes in the Company\u2019s factoring program and related timing of those changes. For the same reason, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which may have a material impact on the Company\u2019s GAAP results.

Use of Non-GAAP Information In addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, we also disclose certain non-GAAP financial information, including: Constant currency revenue growth, which is revenue growth adjusted for the translation effect of foreign currencies so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Constant currency revenue growth is calculated by translating the revenue of each fiscal year in the billing currency to U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year\u2019s currency conversion rate in comparison to prior year\u2019s revenue. Generally, when the U.S. dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, revenue growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than revenue growth reported at actual exchange rates. Pro forma constant currency revenue growth, which is constant currency revenue growth measured against the Company\u2019s combined pro forma results of operations as if the combination with Webhelp had occurred on December 1, 2022. Non-GAAP operating income, which is operating income, adjusted to exclude acquisition-related and integration expenses, including related restructuring costs, step-up depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, and share-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating margin, which is non-GAAP operating income, as defined above, divided by revenue. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA, which is non-GAAP operating income, as defined above, plus depreciation (exclusive of step-up depreciation). Adjusted EBITDA margin, which is adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, divided by revenue. Non-GAAP net income, which is net income excluding the tax-effected impact of acquisition-related and integration expenses, including related restructuring costs, step-up depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation, imputed interest related to the sellers\u2019 note issued in connection with the combination with Webhelp (the \u201csellers\u2019 note\u201d), change in acquisition contingent consideration and foreign currency losses (gains), net. Non-GAAP net income also excludes the income tax effect of certain legal entity restructuring activity. Free cash flow, which is cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures, and adjusted free cash flow, which is free cash flow excluding the effect of changes in the outstanding factoring balance. We believe that free cash flow is a meaningful measure of cash flows since capital expenditures are a necessary component of ongoing operations. We believe that adjusted free cash flow is a meaningful measure of cash flows because it removes the effect of factoring which changes the timing of the receipt of cash for certain receivables. However, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow have limitations because they do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow do not incorporate payments for business acquisitions. Non-GAAP diluted EPS, which is diluted EPS excluding the per share, tax-effected impact of acquisition-related and integration expenses, including related restructuring costs, step-up depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation, imputed interest related to the sellers\u2019 note, change in acquisition contingent consideration and foreign currency losses (gains), net. Non-GAAP EPS also excludes the per share income tax effect of certain legal entity restructuring activity. Non-GAAP EPS excludes net income attributable to participating securities and the related per share, tax-effected impact of adjustments to net income described above reflect only those amounts that are attributable to common shareholders. We believe that providing this additional information is useful to the reader to better assess and understand our base operating performance, especially when comparing results with previous periods and for planning and forecasting in future periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business adjusted for these items in addition to GAAP results. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish operational goals and, in some cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude amortization of intangible assets. Although intangible assets contribute to our revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not directly relate to the services performed for our clients. Additionally, intangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of our acquisition activity. Accordingly, we believe excluding the amortization of intangible assets, along with the other non-GAAP adjustments, which neither relate to the ordinary course of our business nor reflect our underlying business performance, enhances our and our investors\u2019 ability to compare our past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends. These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude share-based compensation expense. Given the subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use when calculating share-based compensation expense, management believes this additional information allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results and those of our peers. As these non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures and should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, data presented in accordance with GAAP.

1 / 2 Symbiotic Set to Report Q1 Earnings: Here's What You Should Know Zacks Equity Research Fri, Jan 10, 2025, 7:43 PM 2 min read In This Article: ABM -0.67% Concentrix Corporation CNXC is scheduled to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Jan. 15, after market close. See Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news. CNXC surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the past four quarters and missed twice, the earnings surprise being 2.3%, on average. Concentrix Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Concentrix Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Concentrix Corporation Quote Concentrix\u2019s Q4 Expectations The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $9.6 billion, suggesting a 35.2% increase from the year-ago quarter\u2019s actual. The top line is estimated to have been driven by an increase in client requests for transformation investments in exchange for longer contracts. We anticipate technology leadership to have allowed the company to drive automation to enhance performance and lower costs for the client while improving the customer experience. Recently, the company launched iX Hello, which is CNXC\u2019s first product in its new Intelligent Experience Technology Suite focussed on assisting organizations to harness the power of Gen-AI across their operations. This above-mentioned product, which integrates across internal applications to boost clients\u2019 productivity, visibility and quality of work with an on-brand, compliant, and secure environment, is likely to have resulted in more client wins, thereby boosting CNXC\u2019s top line. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at $11.1 per share, indicating a 2.9% decline on a year-over-year basis. What Our Model Predicts for CNXC Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Concentrix this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. CNXC has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Earnings Snapshot of CNXC\u2019s Peers ABM Industries Incorporated ABM reported impressive fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results.

Stocks end mixed as Treasury yields extend surge Martin Baccardax Mon, Jan 13, 2025, 1:57 PM 8 min read In this article: ^GSPC -0.76% Updated at 4:40 PM EST by Rob Lenihan Stocks finished mixed Monday, as investors looked to a busy week on Wall Street that could stoke inflation concerns and add further pressure to the recent global stock slump. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 358.67 points, or 0.86%, to end that day at 42,297.12, while the S&P 500 inched up 0.16%, to close at 5,836.22 and the\u00a0tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.38% to end the day at 19,088.10. \u201cAs the new year officially gets underway, there's the usual sense of renewed optimism and excitement over new opportunities,\u201d said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial. \u201cHowever, recent stock market activity is casting a shadow over this sentiment,\" he added. \"Momentum in equity markets has recently stalled, and breadth measures have deteriorated, suggesting the recent pullback might not be over.\u201d Turnquist said that the silver lining to a deeper drawdown is that it could provide a buying opportunity back into this bull market, \"as most importantly, the S&P 500 remains above its longer-term uptrend, and fundamentals are on solid footing.\" Updated at 12:55 PM EST Tesla Tesla shares edged higher in early afternoon trading, against a 1% decline for the Nasdaq, following a price target upgrade from Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas, a longtime Tesla advocate, lifted his near-term objective for the stock to $430, $30 increase from his prior target, and laid out a bull case that could see the stock rise to as high as $800 per share. \"As interest in [autonomous vehicles] continues to rise, we have undertaken the most extensive re-architecture and expansion of our Tesla Mobility (robotaxi) model since initially published in 2015,\u201d Jonas and his team wrote. Tesla shares were marked 0.05% higher in afternoon trading and changing hands at $394.66 each. Updated at 11:22 AM EST United boost UnitedHealth Group ( UNH ) shares are driving all of the Dow's early gains Monday following a better-than-expected forecast for Medicare reimbursement rates in 2026. The U.S. government said late Friday that it will increase\u00a0Medicare Advantage reimbursement rates by 2.2% next year, that along with a 2.1% boost in 'risk score' will likely contribute to an extra $21 billion in payments to private insurers. UnitedHealth shares were marked 4.7% higher in mid-morning trading and changing hands at $544.88 each. The move is responsible for around 160 points of the Dow's early advance. The group will report its fourth quarter earnings before the market opens on Thursday. Story continues Updated at 9:37 AM EST Red open The S&P 500 was marked 44 points, or 0.76% lower in the opening minutes of trading, while the Nasdaq fell 282 points, or 1.58%. The Dow, meanwhile, edged 40 points higher while the mid-cap Russell 2000 fell further into correction territory with a 25 point, or 1.16% decline. Updated at 8:53 AM EST Chip clipped Nvidia shares are leading U.S. chipmakers lower following a new set of restrictions on AI technology exports unveiled by the White House. The complicated rules put limits on AI exports to various countries, which are grouped in various tiers, while maintaining the outright bans on sales to Russia, North Korea, Iran and China. \"The US leads the world in AI now -- both AI development and AI chip design -- and it's critical that we keep it that way,\" said Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. Nvidia shares were last marked 3.3% lower in premarket trading at $131.43 each, with Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) down 1.5% and Broadcom ( AVGO ) falling 2.3%. Related: Analyst revisits Nvidia stock price target amid correction slump Updated at 7:35 AM EST Crude realities Global oil prices topped the $80-per-barrel mark for the first time in more than four months following a round of sanctions on the sale of Russia crude unveiled by the White House late Friday. The new restrictions, put in place as part of a broader package of sanctions tied to Russia's war on Ukraine, cover two oil companies (Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas) as well as 183 vessels that form part of what is called a \"shadow fleet\" of crude exporters. \"The uncertainty over how impactful these sanctions will be is proving bullish for the oil market,\" said ING's head of commodities strategy, Warren Patterson. \"Potentially, Russia will once again be able to take action to minimise the impact of these latest sanctions,\" he added. \"Furthermore, it is not clear whether the incoming Trump administration in the US will keep these sanctions in place, or if they will be strictly enforced.\" Brent crude futures contracts for March delivery, the global pricing benchmark, were last seen trading $1.22 higher on the session at $80.98 per barrel. WTI futures for February, which are tightly linked to U.S. gasoline prices, were last up $1.40 at $77.97 per barrel. Stock Market Today The S&P 500 is now running a two-week losing streak, with the benchmark down 0.93% for the year, following a hotter-than-expected December jobs report, which alongside the uncertainty tied to the new administration of President-elect Donald Trump has triggered renewed inflation worries. Benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yields have largely led the market's concern, rising to a November 2023 high of 4.801% in overnight trading. Two-year notes have risen 17 basis points this year to trade at 4.424%. \"Stocks are struggling to gain traction in the new year. Recent signs of inflation pressure and reduced expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts have pushed rates to uncomfortably high levels, complicating the macro backdrop,\" said Adam Turnquist, chief technical analyst at LPL Financial. \"Unfortunately, near-term technical trends point to additional upside risk for Treasury yields,\" he added. \"Based on this backdrop and the current technical setup for the broader market, we believe a deeper pullback remains potentially on the table as market breadth and momentum wane.\" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues will be closely tracking inflation and consumer spending data this week. ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images The march higher in yields, which both changes the calculation for broader stock prices and offers an attractive, risk-free alternative rate for global investors, is set to face further upward pressure this week in the form or December inflation and retail-sales figures as well as the unofficial start of fourth quarter earnings season. Around 20 S&P 500 companies will report fourth-quarter updates this week, including JP Morgan Chase ( JPM ) , Goldman Sachs ( GS ) , Bank of America ( BAC ) and UnitedHealth Group ( UNH ) . On the macro front, economists are looking for a modest uptick in both core and headline inflation readings for December, while record holiday shopping and travel are likely to lift retail sales close to the $730 billion mark. Heading into the start of the trading day on Wall Street, stocks are looking at another sharply lower open, with futures contracts tied to the S&P 500 suggesting a 47-point opening-bell decline. Related: Bonds hammer Fed rate cut bets as inflation greets Trump White House Futures linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, are priced for a 150-point decline while the Nasdaq, which is down 0.77% for the month, is called 245 points lower. Stocks on the move include Nvidia ( NVDA ) , which was last marked 3% lower in premarket and set to open at $131.82, a move that would drag the market's second-largest stock into correction territory . The market's benchmark volatility index, the VIX, is also on the move, rising 20.37% in after-hours trading to $21.74, the highest in nearly a month. At that level, investors are expecting daily swings of around 1.36%, or 79 points, for the S&P 500 over the next 30 days.

Customer Experience and Revenue Growth Talha Qureshi Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 3:21 PM 6 min read In This Article: CNXC -5.45% We recently published a list of 10 Best Tech Stocks to Invest In On the Dip . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Concentrix Corporation (NASDAQ:CNXC) stands against other best tech stocks to invest in on the dip. How\u2019s The Tech Sector Performing in Q3 2024? Dan Romanoff, a senior equity research analyst at Morningstar provided insights into the current state of the technology sector, on October 1st, 2024. His analysis highlights significant challenges and opportunities for the industry. Romanoff mentioned that after a robust start to 2024, the tech sector experienced a slump in the third quarter. Despite this downturn, software and services companies have continued to report solid quarterly results, even as their stock prices have remained relatively flat. Semiconductor firms, while showing potential for recovery, are currently dragging down overall sector performance. While discussing the sector-wise ranking of the US stock market based on the Q3 earning season, Romanoff pointed out that the technology sector has been the second-best-performing sector over the past year but ranks as the second-worst performer in the most recent quarter. Romanoff emphasizes that despite these fluctuations, there are positive long-term trends that could benefit the industry. He expressed confidence in several long-term growth drivers within technology, including cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and the expansion of semiconductor demand. He mentioned that these factors are expected to sustain growth in the sector even amidst short-term challenges. Moreover, according to Romanoff, the Morningstar US Technology Index has risen by 32% over the past twelve months, outperforming the broader US equity market\u2019s 24% gain. He notes that while the median US technology stock is fairly valued with a modest margin of safety, the sector trades at a slight premium on a market-weighted basis. He identifies semiconductors and hardware as being overvalued compared to software, which appears more attractive at present.

Companies are increasingly integrating next-generation AI capabilities into their products and services. This trend is particularly evident among cloud providers and semiconductor manufacturers. Despite some recent stock pullbacks for Nvidia, Romanoff believes there are still substantial investment opportunities in generative AI beyond just major players. He mentioned that he sees 34% growth in Gen AI Networking equipment spending through 2028. Romanoff also pointed out that the usage of chips and networking gear has grown together from 2022 to 2024 and he expects the trend to continue till 2028. Story Continues Our Methodology To curate the list of the 10 best tech stocks to invest in on the dip, we used the Finviz stock screener and CNN. Using the screener we shortlisted technology stocks that were down at least 25% on a year-t0-date basis, but analysts see a more than 25% upside. Once we had an aggregated list of the tech stocks fitting our criteria, next we cross-checked their analyst upside potential from CNN. Lastly, we ranked these stocks in the ascending order of the analyst upside potential. Please note that the data was collected on November 25, 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ( see more details here ). Concentrix (CNXC): Leveraging AI for Customer Experience and Revenue Growth A digital dashboard detailing customer experience/user experience data. Concentrix Corporation (NASDAQ: CNXC ) Share Price: $44.14 Year-To-Date Performance: -54.81% Analyst Upside Potential: 58.66% Concentrix Corporation (NASDAQ:CNXC) is a technology company that specializes in improving customer experiences for businesses. The company also uses data to understand customer behavior and feedback. For instance, the Voice of Customer service of the company involves gathering and analyzing customer feedback to understand their needs better. The company, on September 25th, announced the launch of its new product called iX Hello, which is an intelligent experience technology suite designed to enhance business productivity through generative AI. The product is a fully customizable, AI-powered virtual assistant that can be tailored to fit the specific needs of any business. It can be deployed quickly without requiring complex coding, making it accessible to various teams within an organization. Concentrix Corporation (NASDAQ:CNXC) has been doing great in terms of revenue generation. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the company generated $2.39 billion in revenue, up 46.2% year-over-year. As per the management, revenue growth for the quarter was driven by 8% year-over-year growth in retail, travel, and e-commerce verticals. It is one of the best tech stocks to invest in on the dip and analysts\u2019 12-month median price target is pointing towards a 59% upside from current levels. FPA Queens Road Small Cap Value Fund stated the following regarding Concentrix Corporation (NASDAQ:CNXC) in its Q3 2024 investor letter : \u201cConcentrix Corporation (NASDAQ:CNXC) is one of two top customer experience (CX) vendors globally. The company began by managing call centers but has since evolved into a high-tech business process outsourcer (BPO) that also designs and runs customer-facing websites and apps, integrates the data, and optimizes a client\u2019s customer interactions. The company was spun out from TD Synnex, another of the Fund\u2019s core holdings, and we have always been impressed with CNXC\u2019s innovation and growth. CX is a relatively new business model, and Concentrix has been rolling up smaller competitors. In March, 2023 they bought WebHelp, a leading European CX player, for $4.8B in cash and stock. 22 We believe the WebHelp acquisition will help consolidate an industry where Concentrix and Teleperformance are the largest players. Overall, CNXC ranks 6th on our list of best tech stocks to invest in on the dip. While we acknowledge the potential of CNXC to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.
