The biogas industry kept busy to close out the end of 2024. The U.S. Treasury released final credit guidance for Section 48 Investment Tax Credits, which provided a tax discount for projects that refined biogas into renewable natural gas and began construction last year. If past is prologue, new tax credit language could continue to prove enticing for project developers in the coming year. Congress is slated to pass a major tax package for the first time since 2017, and experts say the RNG industry may advocate to extend or make certain credits like Section 48 permanent, locking in a more favorable business environment for new projects. Aaron Lang, a partner at tax firm Foley Hoag who specializes in clean energy projects, said technologies like solar and wind that first received favorable tax credits years ago rode those tailwinds to accelerate deployment in recent years. But without the certainty of a multiyear credit, it's hard for a category like RNG to reach the same heights. \u201cIt's all about what level of certainty in the investor space these tax credits provide,\u201d\u00a0Lang said. \u201cIf there is some sort of legislative extension, I would expect that more and more projects will pursue this credit.\u201d Credit pricing as of Dec. 20, 2024 D3 RIN prices: $2.289 Up from $2.270 in 2023 D5 RIN prices: $0.565 Up from $0.540 in 2023 $40 Price per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent in Oregon\u2019s Clean Fuels Program $75.91 Price per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent in California\u2019s Low Carbon Fuel Standard Source: EcoEngineers Carbon Market Snapshot, Dec. 20 Republic Services, Ameresco launch JV for latest project Ameresco and Republic Services announced the completion of the pair's 14th landfill-gas-to-RNG project on Dec. 9. The facility, located at Republic's Roxana Landfill in Edwardsville, Illinois, is also one of the largest facilities of its type, according to a release. The facility can process up to 6,000 standard cubic feet per minute of landfill gas, which was previously flared. This is the first time Republic and Ameresco have created a joint venture in order to co-invest in an RNG facility. The pair have eight additional projects in various stages of development. Republic has also pursued a joint venture model with Archaea Energy, a division of BP, which delivered its first project last summer. Republic has a goal to reuse 50% more of its biogas by 2030. Story Continues Recology partners with Waga, G2 Energy at two landfills G2 Energy and Waga Energy are partnering to develop landfill-gas-to-RNG facilities at two Recology landfills in California, the partners announced . The projects will upgrade existing facilities that have used the gas to produce electricity. Both projects are expected to be operating in 2026. The first, at Recology's Ostrom Road Landfill, is expected to produce 420,000 mmBtus of RNG annually. The second, at Recology's Hay Road Landfill, is expected to produce 630,000 mmBtus of RNG annually. The two facilities will inject the RNG into the local grid, run by Pacific Gas & Electric. These will be the first two Waga units in California. The projects will also contribute to Recology's goal to use 75% of its landfill gas to produce renewable energy by 2028, CEO Sal Coniglio said in a statement. Waga builds on Pennsylvania portfolio Waga also closed a deal with a public sector partner in December. The Southeastern Chester County Refuse Authority in Pennsylvania announced a 20-year agreement with Waga in which the company will finance, build, own and operate a landfill-gas-to-RNG facility at the SECCRA Community Landfill in West Grove. The project, once completed in 2026, is expected to produce 229,000 mmBtus of RNG annually which it will inject into the natural gas grid. This is Waga's second project in the county. It previously partnered with the Chester County Solid Waste Authority to build a site at the Lanchester Landfill and Reclamation Center, where it will produce 450,000 mmBtus of RNG annually. That project was announced in 2023 and is currently under construction. Clean Energy Fuels announces strong sales quarter RNG fuels developer Clean Energy announced in a release that the third quarter was one of its best for RNG sales yet. The company, which builds fueling stations and other RNG infrastructure for customers, listed deals with several new and returning clients. Among them were multiple waste companies. Noble Environmental inked a deal for a new fueling station in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. The station is expected to power 50 sanitation trucks. MarBorg Industries also inked a maintenance deal with Clean Energy for a 25-truck fleet in California. Elsewhere, multiple transit agencies, including LA Metro in California, Arlington Transit in Virginia and Dallas Area Rapid Transit in Texas all inked RNG fueling deals with Clean Energy. Additional customers included DHL, Food Express and Estes Express Lines. Vision RNG to evaluate South Carolina landfill for new project Vision RNG inked a long-term gas rights agreement with Greenwood County, South Carolina, for its publicly owned landfill. Under the agreement, the company will evaluate the landfill to determine the amount of usable gas. It will then build out either an RNG or power production project based on the findings. Vision RNG will optimize the landfill's existing gas collection and control system over the next year. The agreement could run as long as 25 years, according to a release.

earnings of $0.02 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.02 per share. This compares to break-even earnings per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 200%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this provider of natural gas as an alternative fuel for vehicle fleets would post a loss of $0.04 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.01, delivering a surprise of 125%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. Clean Energy Fuels , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Gas Distribution industry, posted revenues of $104.88 million for the quarter ended September 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.30%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $95.57 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Clean Energy Fuels shares have lost about 19.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 21.2%. What's Next for Clean Energy Fuels? While Clean Energy Fuels has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Clean Energy Fuels: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

(CLNE): Analysts Are Bullish On This Oil and Gas Stock Now Sheryar Siddiq Sat, Nov 23, 2024, 5:58 PM 6 min read In This Article: CLNE We recently compiled a list of the Top 10 Oil and Gas Stocks To Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Clean Energy Fuels Corp. (NASDAQ:CLNE) stands against the other oil and gas stocks to buy. While renewable energy sources garner increasing attention, the demand for oil and gas remains strong, fueled by the growing energy needs of developed and developing nations. However, the industry is highly volatile, with profits and losses often hinging on minor demand shifts or strategic actions by petrostates like Saudi Arabia and Russia, whose agendas may conflict with those of public oil companies. Supply-demand imbalances frequently trigger significant price swings, as evidenced in early 2022 when Russia's invasion of Ukraine drove crude prices into triple digits for the first time in years. The State of the Oil and Gas Market Global oil prices have retreated from their early-October highs, with market focus shifting from supply risks to concerns about global economic health, sluggish demand, and ample supply. After surpassing $80 per barrel in early October, Brent crude futures dropped to approximately $72 per barrel by mid-November as fears of an Israeli attack on Iran\u2019s energy infrastructure subsided. Meanwhile, the global oil supply is steadily increasing. Following the early November U.S. elections, the United States is expected to lead non-OPEC+ supply growth, contributing 1.5 million barrels per day (mb/d) in both 2024 and 2025, alongside higher output from Canada, Guyana, and Argentina. Brazil, which faced operational challenges and outages this year, is projected to add 210,000 barrels per day (kb/d) by 2025, reaching 3.7 mb/d as new capacity exceeding 800 kb/d comes online. In another vein, the International Energy Agency (IEA)'s World Energy Outlook 2024 predicts that global oil demand will increase by about 2.6 million b/d from 2023 to 2030 before peaking, driven by rising EV adoption and improved fuel efficiency. Petrochemicals are expected to overtake road transport as the primary driver of oil demand growth. By 2050, the IEA projects global oil demand to average 93.1 million b/d, 4.3 million b/d lower than its prior estimate under the Stated Energy Policies Scenario (STEPS). The most significant declines are expected in aviation and shipping, with demand dropping by 2.7 million b/d as sustainable aviation fuels gain traction and hydrogen-based alternative fuels are increasingly adopted in maritime transport. U.S. - China Oil Politics China's oil refiners processed 4.6% less crude in October compared to the same period last year, attributed to plant closures and reduced operating rates among smaller independent refiners, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics released on November 15. Simultaneously, China's factory output growth slowed, and persistent weakness in its property sector added to investor concerns about the economic health of the world's largest crude importer. Story Continues Compounding these challenges, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump advocates for reducing regulations on the oil sector to boost U.S. production, a move that could exert downward pressure on oil prices. However, with U.S. crude output already near record highs, questions arise about the industry\u2019s capacity to increase production further. Even if they could, companies may hesitate, as ramping up output could drive prices down, potentially impacting profits and shareholder returns. Most notably, however, Trump has vowed to revoke China's most-favored-nation trading status and impose tariffs exceeding 60% on Chinese imports\u2014far surpassing the levels enacted during his first term. If crude oil is included, it could squeeze the margins of U.S. refiners reliant on imported oil. Additionally, it may harm U.S. exports of crude and refined products if other nations respond with retaliatory tariffs. In light of this, Goldman Sachs Research economists have modestly lowered their 2025 growth forecast for China, attributing the adjustment to anticipated tariff increases under a Trump administration. Chief economist Jan Hatzius further cautioned that more substantial downgrades could follow if the trade conflict intensifies.

(CLNE) the Best Renewable Energy Penny Stock to Invest In Now? Mashaid Ahmed Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 8:38 PM 6 min read In This Article: CLNE We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Renewable Energy Penny Stocks to Invest In . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Clean Energy Fuels Corp. (NASDAQ:CLNE) stands against the other renewable energy penny stocks. On November 11, the Financial Times reported that the U.S. clean energy industry faces a significant setback following Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. The article highlights that several developers have halted projects, and investors are selling shares due to uncertainties about policy direction and federal funding under the incoming Trump administration. According to Mike Carr, president of Solar Energy Manufacturers for America, approximately half a dozen clean energy projects are awaiting policy certainty before proceeding. Trump\u2019s election, combined with the prospect of a Republican-controlled Congress, has led to a sharp decline in renewable energy stocks. The iShares Global Clean Energy ETF dropped 7% after the election. Additionally, short sellers of renewable energy stocks reportedly profited over $1 billion in the aftermath. Despite the turbulence, some industry leaders and analysts remain cautiously optimistic, suggesting that the economic case for renewable projects could persist under a Trump administration. They also believe that existing tax credits for power generation and manufacturing may remain intact. However, they warn that sectors such as offshore wind and electric vehicles may face significant challenges. Trump has pledged to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, a major driver of U.S. clean energy investment, and vowed to expand oil and gas production while halting offshore wind projects and EV mandates. Biden\u2019s target to reduce emissions by 50-52% from 2005 levels by 2030 is at risk under a second Trump term. Such a shift could result in an additional 500 million tonnes of carbon emissions in the energy sector by the end of the decade. US Renewable Energy Sector Continues to Grow, Despite Challenges While uncertainties loom over the renewable energy sector, the industry continues to demonstrate resilience. According to a report by Rhodium Group, a New York-based research institute, the renewable energy and transportation investment in the United States has continued to break records, reaching a new high of $71 billion in the third quarter of 2024. This marks a 12% increase from the same period in 2023 and a nearly unbroken quarter-on-quarter growth trend over the past three years. The report highlights that renewable investment accounted for 5% of total US private investment in structures, equipment, and durable consumer goods, up from 4.5% in the third quarter of 2023. Retail investment was a major driver of this growth, increasing by 9% relative to the previous quarter, largely due to a surge in zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) sales. However, investment in renewable technology manufacturing remained flat quarter-on-quarter, while investment in deploying technology to decarbonize energy and industrial production slipped 7% quarter-on-quarter. Story Continues The report also assessed the progress of the US renewable electricity transition and found that the current pace of capacity expansion is falling short of what is needed to deliver a 40% reduction in net GHG emissions below 2005 levels by 2030. The analysis of projects in the pipeline suggests that both solar and wind are underperforming, aligning more closely with a scenario that would yield only a 30% reduction by 2030. Despite the challenges and uncertainties facing the renewable energy sector, the industry's resilience and potential for growth remain evident.

Clean Energy Stock? Nilanjan Choudhury Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 11:00 PM 5 min read In This Article: CLNE Earlier this month, natural gas supplier Clean Energy Fuels Corp. CLNE reported strong third quarter earnings, with 9% revenue growth and a 20% earnings beat, driving a 5% share price increase. With its market-leading renewable natural gas (\u201cRNG\u201d) exposure and aggressive capacity expansion plans, CLNE could deliver compelling results in the foreseeable future, but investors should consider a few issues, including\u00a0 valuation concerns, before buying. CLNE\u2019s Business Overview Clean Energy Fuels is focused on providing RNG and regular natural gas options like compressed and liquefied natural gas. With more than 600 fueling stations across the United States and Canada, it primarily supports heavy-duty trucks and other large vehicles. The company is dedicated to increasing its RNG production, aiming to play a big role in helping the transportation industry switch to cleaner energy. Clean Energy Fuels Corp. Image Source: Clean Energy Fuels Corp. Clean Energy Q3 Earnings: Positive Takeaways CLNE\u2019s third-quarter results show signs of improvement. During this period, the company sold 59.6 million gallons of RNG, up from 56.7 million in the same quarter last year. Despite a net loss, the company posted a positive non-GAAP EPS and an adjusted EBITDA of $21.3 million, up from $14.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Clean Energy\u2019s operational and maintenance services have also demonstrated steady growth, contributing nearly 14% to revenues in the first nine months of 2024, up 7.6% year over year. These recurring revenues, coupled with a growing station construction business that rose 8% from a year ago, enhance the company\u2019s financial stability. Despite these encouraging numbers, the report revealed several concerns that continue to weigh on the stock, which we detail below. Multiple Red Flags for CLNE Stock Low Credit Prices for LCFS and RINs: In the third quarter of 2024, the average Low Carbon Fuel Standard credit price dropped to $55.67, significantly lower than $74.20 in the corresponding period of 2023. This decline impacted Clean Energy's RNG revenues. Potential Impact of Expiring Tax Credits: The uncertainty surrounding the renewal of the Alternative Fuel Tax Credit (\u201cAFTC\u201d), which contributed approximately $22 million to Clean Energy Fuels' 2024 revenues, could weigh on its financials in 2025. If the AFTC is not extended, this revenue source will be lost, affecting profitability. Delayed Ramp-Up of RNG Projects: Clean Energy Fuels\u2019 RNG production remains in a ramp-up phase, with output expected to increase from 4-6 million gallons in 2025. However, the company's largest RNG project in Idaho has faced operational costs during construction, negatively impacting quarterly financials. Story Continues What About Clean Energy\u2019s Valuation? CLNE doesn\u2019t look very appealing from a valuation standpoint. When comparing its EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) \u2014 a common measure of a company\u2019s worth \u2014 it doesn\u2019t stand out as competitive against other renewable energy firms. Its current market value of $621 million is a sharp drop from its previous peak of $3.5 billion, highlighting this decline. Additionally, despite its low stock price, the company has a poor Value Score of D, raising further concerns. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Price Performance Reflects CLNE\u2019s Struggles Shares of Clean Energy Fuels have lost more than 24% so far this year, significantly underperforming the industry and the S&P 500. CLNE Year-to-Date Stock Performance Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Notwithstanding this share price disappointment, there are a few positive factors working in the company\u2019s favor. Positive Factors Amid Share Price Challenges Expanding Strategic Partnerships and Station Network Growth: Clean Energy Fuels\u2019 ongoing collaboration with Amazon AMZN highlights its ability to secure influential partners. The recently opened Bordentown, NJ station, part of the Amazon contract, adds to a network that has grown nearly 15% in 2024. These strategically placed stations cater to Amazon trucks and other heavy-duty fleets, preparing Clean Energy for increased demand. Promising RNG Production and Strategic Maas Energy Partnership: CLNE\u2019s partnership with Maas Energy is accelerating its RNG production pipeline, with six projects operational and two more set for completion by late 2025. The covered lagoon method utilized by Maas ensures efficient dairy-based RNG production. With expansion plans across Georgia, Florida and South Dakota, Clean Energy is poised to strengthen its upstream capacity, aligning well with the growing demand for renewable energy in transportation and supporting long-term revenue streams. Strategic Shift Toward Production: Clean Energy Fuels is increasing its ownership of RNG production facilities through partnerships with BP plc BP and TotalEnergies TTE, positioning itself for greater profitability. By transitioning from a distributor to a producer, the company stands to gain from higher margins and access to additional environmental credits. Final Verdict: CLNE Stock is a Hold While Clean Energy Fuels' Q3 earnings showed notable revenue growth and profitability improvements, these positives are overshadowed by significant challenges. Factors like declining credit prices, uncertainty around tax credits, and project delays raise questions about the company's near-term prospects. Combined with weak valuation metrics and a struggling share price, these concerns suggest that the earnings beat alone may not be enough to justify a bullish stance on the stock.

current fleet of CNG buses (Photo: Business Wire) New station to support Riverside Transit Agency\u2019s growing hydrogen bus fleet with state-of-the-art fueling infrastructure and hydrogen supply NEWPORT BEACH, Calif., December 11, 2024 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Clean Energy (NASDAQ: CLNE ), the country\u2019s largest provider of the cleanest fuel for the transportation market, has been awarded the contract to design and construct a new state-of-the-art hydrogen fueling station for Riverside Transit Agency (RTA) in California. The contract was won following a competitive solicitation and also includes the supply of hydrogen and maintenance services for the private access, purpose-built station located in Riverside. RTA plans to initially operate five fuel cell buses when the station opens and will grow its fleet to over 100 hydrogen-powered buses over the next decade. The new facility will play a central role in RTA\u2019s commitment to transition to a zero-emission vehicle fleet. As a transit agency who serves one of the geographically largest regions in the U.S., RTA has some of the longest passenger routes, making hydrogen a natural choice as a clean alternative fuel and an alternative to battery-electric buses to power the agency\u2019s high-mileage transit bus routes. \"Being awarded another hydrogen station is a testament to Clean Energy\u2019s leadership and expertise in the hydrogen fueling space. Partnering with the forward-thinking team at Riverside Transit is a great feather in our hat as they transition, expand and diversify to other clean, low emissions technologies,\" said Chad Lindholm, senior vice president of Clean Energy. \"Hydrogen offers a reliable solution for long routes and this new station will support RTA\u2019s goals to serve their community cleanly for years to come.\" \"This project reflects our commitment to fostering healthier communities by advancing clean energy solutions and is a critical milestone as we move to a zero-emission vehicle fleet,\" said Jeremy Smith, Board Chair at Riverside Transit Agency. \"We are driving innovation while addressing the need for environmentally responsible solutions.\" This station announcement follows news that RTA will purchase five 40-foot hydrogen fuel cell electric buses after being awarded a $5.1 million grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation which begins the agency\u2019s plan of transitioning its large bus fleet to zero-emissions vehicles, expected to take place in phases beginning in 2026. This is the second hydrogen station project Clean Energy has been awarded recently with the first build successfully completed for Foothill Transit Agency in Pomona, CA, in June 2023.

I\u2019m particularly pleased that we continued our strong financial performance and it\u2019s exciting to see the enthusiasm in the use of RNG as heavy-duty fleets have a new RNG engine that meets their demands when other alternative technologies continue to disappoint.\" Summary and Review of Results The Company\u2019s revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was reduced by $15.8 million of non-cash stock-based sales incentive contra-revenue charges (\"Amazon warrant charges\") relating to the warrant issued to Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC (the \"Amazon warrant\"), compared to Amazon warrant charges of $16.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. Q3 2024 volume-related fuel sales revenues of $64.1 million, net of the $15.8 million Amazon warrant charge, were higher than the third quarter of 2023 by 6.8% due to increased volumes of vehicle fueling at the Company\u2019s stations and increased bulk fuel sales into the marine sector, with partial offsets due to lower underlying natural gas commodity prices in Q3 2024 versus Q3 2023. Q3 2024 renewable identification number (\"RIN\") and low carbon fuel standards (\"LCFS\") revenues totaled $13.0 million versus $9.6 million of RIN and LCFS revenues in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting principally higher RIN credit prices and higher share of RIN values, partially offset by lower LCFS credit prices in the third quarter of 2024. Q3 2024 includes $6.4 million of alternative fuel excise tax credit (\"AFTC\") revenue versus $5.4 million of AFTC in the third quarter of 2023. Q3 2024 includes station construction revenues of $7.8 million versus $7.7 million of station construction revenues in Q3 2023 due to increased construction activities. Story Continues Net loss attributable to Clean Energy for the third quarter of 2024 had lower Amazon warrant charges when compared to Q3 2023. Q3 2024 non-operating net interest expenses and losses from equity method investments were higher than Q3 2023 primarily due to higher outstanding indebtedness combined with higher amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and expansion of our RNG investments, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses were lower in Q3 2024 by approximately $0.2 million mainly due to lower stock-based compensation expense resulting from vesting of equity awards granted in prior years. Non-GAAP income (loss) per share (as defined below) for the third quarter of 2024 was $0.02, compared to $(0.00) per share for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) was $21.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $14.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. In this press release, Clean Energy refers to various GAAP (U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) and non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures being used and disclosed by other companies. Clean Energy believes that this non-GAAP information is useful to an understanding of its operating results and the ongoing performance of its business. Non-GAAP income (loss) per share and Adjusted EBITDA are defined below and reconciled to GAAP net income (loss) per share attributable to Clean Energy and GAAP net income (loss) attributable to Clean Energy, respectively. The table below shows GAAP and non-GAAP income (loss) attributable to Clean Energy per share and also reconciles GAAP net income (loss) attributable to Clean Energy to the non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to Clean Energy figure used in the calculation of non-GAAP income (loss) per share: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, (in thousands, except share and per share data) 2023 2024 2023 2024 Net loss attributable to Clean Energy Fuels Corp. $ (25,812 ) $ (18,175 ) $ (80,810 ) $ (52,911 ) Amazon warrant charges 16,821 15,766 44,473 42,742 Stock-based compensation 6,091 2,863 18,280 8,354 Loss (income) from Rimere equity method investment \u2014 1,850 \u2014 4,394 Loss (income) from SAFE&CEC S.r.l. equity method investment 1,071 16 1,324 1,884 Loss (gain) from change in fair value of derivative instruments 1,372 1,416 304 (267 ) Amortization of investment tax credit from RNG equity method investments \u2014 (268 ) \u2014 (367 ) Non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to Clean Energy Fuels Corp. $ (457 ) $ 3,468 $ (16,429 ) $ 3,829 Diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding 222,973,575 224,430,603 222,867,303 224,164,054 GAAP loss attributable to Clean Energy Fuels Corp. per share $ (0.12 ) $ (0.08 ) $ (0.36 ) $ (0.24 ) Non-GAAP income (loss) attributable to Clean Energy Fuels Corp. per share $ (0.00 ) $ 0.02 $ (0.07 ) $ 0.02 The table below shows Adjusted EBITDA and also reconciles this figure to GAAP net loss attributable to Clean Energy: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, (in thousands) 2023 2024 2023 2024 Net loss attributable to Clean Energy Fuels Corp. $ (25,812 ) $ (18,175 ) $ (80,810 ) $ (52,911 ) Income tax expense (benefit) (47 ) 50 (166 ) 630 Interest expense 3,893 8,357 12,612 24,040 Interest income (2,551 ) (3,600 ) (8,034 ) (10,818 ) Depreciation and amortization 13,389 11,350 34,960 33,796 Amazon warrant charges 16,821 15,766 44,473 42,742 Stock-based compensation 6,091 2,863 18,280 8,354 Loss (income) from Rimere equity method investment \u2014 1,850 \u2014 4,394 Loss (income) from SAFE&CEC S.r.l. equity method investment 1,071 16 1,324 1,884 Loss (gain) from change in fair value of derivative instruments 1,372 1,416 304 (267 ) Depreciation and amortization from RNG equity method investments 299 1,927 709 3,485 Interest expense from RNG equity method investments 238 664 726 1,212 Interest income from RNG equity method investments (518 ) (936 ) (1,958 ) (3,142 ) Amortization of investment tax credit from RNG equity method investments \u2014 (268 ) \u2014 (367 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 14,246 $ 21,280 $ 22,420 $ 53,032 The tables below present a further breakdown of the above consolidated Adjusted EBITDA: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, (in thousands) 2023 2024 2023 2024 Net loss attributable to fuel distribution $ (24,497 ) $ (15,026 ) $ (77,560 ) $ (42,969 ) Income tax expense (benefit) (47 ) 50 (166 ) 630 Interest expense 3,893 8,357 12,612 24,040 Interest income (2,551 ) (3,600 ) (8,034 ) (10,818 ) Depreciation and amortization 13,389 11,350 34,960 33,796 Amazon warrant charges 16,821 15,766 44,473 42,742 Stock-based compensation 6,091 2,863 18,280 8,354 Loss (income) from Rimere equity method investment \u2014 1,850 \u2014 4,394 Loss (income) from SAFE&CEC S.r.l. equity method investment 1,071 16 1,324 1,884 Loss (gain) from change in fair value of derivative instruments 1,372 1,416 304 (267 ) Adjusted EBITDA attributable to fuel distribution $ 15,542 $ 23,042 $ 26,193 $ 61,786 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, (in thousands) 2023 2024 2023 2024 Net loss from RNG equity method investments attributable to Clean Energy Fuels Corp. $ (1,315 ) $ (3,149 ) $ (3,250 ) $ (9,942 ) Depreciation and amortization from RNG equity method investments 299 1,927 709 3,485 Interest expense from RNG equity method investments 238 664 726 1,212 Interest income from RNG equity method investments (518 ) (936 ) (1,958 ) (3,142 ) Amortization of investment tax credit from RNG equity method investments \u2014 (268 ) \u2014 (367 ) Adjusted EBITDA of RNG equity method investments attributable to Clean Energy Fuels Corp. $ (1,296 ) $ (1,762 ) $ (3,773 ) $ (8,754 ) Fuel and Service Volume The following tables present, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, (1) the amount of total fuel volume the Company sold to customers with particular focus on RNG volume as a subset of total fuel volume and (2) operation and maintenance (\"O&M\") services volume dispensed at facilities the Company does not own but at which it provides O&M services on a per-gallon or fixed fee basis. Certain gallons are included in both fuel and service volumes when the Company sells fuel (product revenue) to a customer and provides maintenance services (service revenue) to the same customer. Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Fuel volume, GGEs (1) sold (in millions), September 30, September 30, correlating to total volume-related product revenue 2023 2024 2023 2024 RNG 56.7 59.6 168.7 174.7 Conventional natural gas 17.1 13.9 46.6 44.2 Total fuel volume 73.8 73.5 215.3 218.9 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended O&M services volume, GGEs (1) serviced (in millions), September 30, September 30, correlating to volume-related O&M services revenue 2023 2024 2023 2024 O&M services volume 66.2 65.6 191.7 198.9 _______________________________ (1) The Company calculates one gasoline gallon equivalent (\"GGE\") to equal 125,000 British Thermal Units (\"BTUs\"), and, as such, one million BTUs (\"MMBTU\") equal eight GGEs. Sources of Revenue The following table shows the Company\u2019s sources of revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, Revenue (in millions) 2023 2024 2023 2024 Product revenue: Volume-related (1) Fuel sales (2) (4) $ 60.0 $ 64.1 $ 220.2 $ 189.7 Change in fair value of derivative instruments (3) (1.4 ) (1.4 ) (0.3 ) 0.3 RIN Credits 6.8 11.1 16.7 29.4 LCFS Credits 2.8 1.9 7.5 6.0 AFTC 5.4 6.4 15.0 17.8 Total volume-related product revenue 73.6 82.1 259.1 243.2 Station construction sales 7.7 7.8 17.6 19.1 Total product revenue 81.3 89.9 276.7 262.3 Service revenue: Volume-related, O&M services 13.7 14.4 39.6 42.5 Other services 0.6 0.6 2.0 1.7 Total service revenue 14.3 15.0 41.6 44.2 Total revenue $ 95.6 $ 104.9 $ 318.3 $ 306.5 _______________________________ (1) The Company\u2019s volume-related product revenue primarily consists of sales of RNG and conventional natural gas, in the form of CNG and LNG, and sales of RINs and LCFS Credits in addition to changes in fair value of our derivative instruments. (2) Includes $16.8 million and $45.5 million of Amazon warrant non-cash stock-based sales incentive contra-revenue charges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Includes $15.8 million and $42.7 million of Amazon warrant non-cash stock-based sales incentive contra-revenue charges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. (3) The change in fair value of unsettled derivative instruments is related to the Company\u2019s commodity swap and customer fueling contracts. The amounts are classified as revenue because the Company\u2019s commodity swap contracts are used to economically offset the risk associated with the diesel-to-natural gas price spread resulting from customer fueling contracts under the Company\u2019s truck financing program. (4) Includes net settlement of the Company\u2019s commodity swap derivative instruments. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, net settlement payments recognized in fuel revenue were $1.9 million and $2.9 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net settlement payments recognized in fuel revenue were $0.0 million and $2.4 million, respectively. 2024 Outlook Our GAAP net loss for 2024 is expected to range from approximately $(91) million to $(81) million, assuming no unrealized gains or losses on commodity swap and customer contracts relating to the Company\u2019s truck financing program and including Amazon warrant charges estimated to be approximately $63 million. Changes in diesel and natural gas market conditions resulting in unrealized gains or losses on the Company\u2019s commodity swap and customer fueling contracts relating to the Company\u2019s truck financing program, and significant variations in the vesting of the Amazon warrant could significantly affect the Company\u2019s estimated GAAP net loss for 2024. Adjusted EBITDA for 2024 is estimated to range from approximately $62 million to $72 million. These expectations exclude the impact of any acquisitions, divestitures, new joint ventures, transactions and other extraordinary events; any lingering negative effects associated directly or indirectly with the COVID-19 pandemic; and macroeconomic conditions and global supply chain issues. Additionally, the expectations regarding 2024 Adjusted EBITDA assumes the calculation of this non-GAAP financial measure in the same manner as described above and adding back the estimated Amazon warrant charges described above and without adjustments for any other items that may arise during 2024 that management deems appropriate to exclude. These expectations are forward-looking statements and are qualified by the statement under \"Safe Harbor Statement\" below.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement the Company\u2019s unaudited consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses non-GAAP financial measures that it calls non-GAAP income (loss) per share (\"non-GAAP income (loss) per share\") and adjusted EBITDA (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"). Management presents non-GAAP income (loss) per share and Adjusted EBITDA because it believes these measures provide meaningful supplemental information about the Company\u2019s performance for the following reasons: (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management to assess the Company\u2019s operating performance and make financial and operational decisions; (2) they exclude the effect of items that management believes are not directly attributable to the Company\u2019s core operating performance and may obscure trends in the business; and (3) they are used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help analyze the Company\u2019s business. In future quarters, the Company may adjust for other expenditures, charges or gains to present non-GAAP financial measures that the Company\u2019s management believes are indicative of the Company\u2019s core operating performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are limited as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company\u2019s GAAP results. The Company expects to continue reporting non-GAAP financial measures, adjusting for the items described below (and/or other items that may arise in the future as the Company\u2019s management deems appropriate), and the Company expects to continue to incur expenses, charges or gains like the non-GAAP adjustments described below. Accordingly, unless expressly stated otherwise, the exclusion of these and other similar items in the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring. Non-GAAP income (loss) per share and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and do not purport to be an alternative to GAAP income (loss), GAAP income (loss) per share or any other GAAP measure as an indicator of operating performance. Moreover, because not all companies use identical measures and calculations, the Company\u2019s presentation of non-GAAP income (loss) per share and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP Income (Loss) Per Share Non-GAAP income (loss) per share, which the Company presents as a non-GAAP measure of its performance, is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Clean Energy Fuels Corp., plus Amazon warrant charges, plus stock-based compensation expense, plus (minus) loss (income) from Rimere equity method investment, plus (minus) loss (income) from the SAFE&CEC S.r.l. equity method investment, plus (minus) any loss (gain) from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments, and minus amortization of investment tax credit from RNG equity method investments, the total of which is divided by the Company\u2019s weighted-average common shares outstanding on a diluted basis. The Company\u2019s management believes excluding non-cash expenses related to the Amazon warrant charges provides useful information to investors regarding the Company\u2019s performance because the Amazon warrant charges are measured based upon a fair value determined using a variety of assumptions and estimates, and the Amazon warrant charges do not affect the Company\u2019s operating cash flows related to the delivery and sale of vehicle fuel to its customer. The Company\u2019s management believes excluding non-cash expenses related to stock-based compensation provides useful information to investors regarding the Company\u2019s performance because of the varying available valuation methodologies, the volatility of the expense (which depends on market forces outside of management\u2019s control), the subjectivity of the assumptions and the variety of award types that a company can use, which may obscure trends in a company\u2019s core operating performance. In addition, the Company\u2019s management believes excluding the results from the Rimere equity method investment is useful to investors because Rimere is an investment belonging to the non-core operations of the Company, and its results are not indicative of the Company\u2019s ongoing operations. Similarly, the Company\u2019s management believes excluding the non-cash results from the SAFE&CEC S.r.l. equity method investment is useful to investors because these charges are not part of or representative of the core operations of the Company. In addition, the Company\u2019s management believes excluding the non-cash loss (gain) from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments is useful to investors because the valuation of the derivative instruments is based on a number of subjective assumptions, the amount of the loss or gain is derived from market forces outside of management\u2019s control, and the exclusion of these amounts enables investors to compare the Company\u2019s performance with other companies that do not use, or use different forms of, derivative instruments. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s management believes excluding other income relating to the amortization of investment tax credit from RNG equity method investments is useful to investors because such income is not generated from the core operations of the Company and may obscure trends of the Company\u2019s core operations. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA, which the Company presents as a non-GAAP measure of its performance, is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Clean Energy Fuels Corp., plus (minus) income tax expense (benefit), plus interest expense (including any losses from the extinguishment of debt), minus interest income, plus depreciation and amortization expense, plus Amazon warrant charges, plus stock-based compensation expense, plus (minus) loss (income) from the Rimere equity method investment, plus (minus) loss (income) from the SAFE&CEC S.r.l. equity method investment, plus (minus) any loss (gain) from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments, plus depreciation and amortization expense from RNG equity method investments, plus interest expense from RNG equity method investments, minus interest income from RNG equity method investments, and minus amortization of investment tax credit from RNG equity method investments. The Company\u2019s management believes Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding the Company\u2019s performance for the same reasons discussed above with respect to non-GAAP income (loss) per share. In addition, management internally uses Adjusted EBITDA to determine elements of executive and employee compensation.
