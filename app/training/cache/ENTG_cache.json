[{"text": "3 Reasons to Avoid ENTG and 1 Stock to Buy Instead Anthony Lee Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 12:09 PM 3 min read In This Article: ENTG -2.05% 3 Reasons to Avoid ENTG and 1 Stock to Buy Instead Entegris has gotten torched over the last six months - since July 2024, its stock price has dropped 21.3% to $100.53 per share. This was partly driven by its softer quarterly results and may have investors wondering how to approach the situation. Is there a buying opportunity in Entegris, or does it present a risk to your portfolio? Get the full breakdown from our expert analysts, it\u2019s free . Even though the stock has become cheaper, we don't have much confidence in Entegris. Here are three reasons why there are better opportunities than ENTG and a stock we'd rather own. Why Is Entegris Not Exciting? With fabs representing the company\u2019s largest customer type, Entegris (NASDAQ:ENTG) supplies products that purify, protect, and generally ensure the integrity of raw materials needed for advanced semiconductor manufacturing. 1. Lackluster Revenue Growth We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within semiconductors, a stretched historical view may miss new demand cycles or industry trends like AI. Entegris\u2019s recent history shows its demand slowed significantly as its annualized revenue growth of 3.8% over the last two years is well below its five-year trend. Entegris Year-On-Year Revenue Growth 2. Operating Margin Falling Operating margin is a key measure of profitability. Think of it as net income - the bottom line - excluding the impact of taxes and interest on debt, which are less connected to business fundamentals. Looking at the trend in its profitability, Entegris\u2019s operating margin decreased by 5.6 percentage points over the last five years. The company\u2019s performance was poor no matter how you look at it. It shows operating expenses were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass those costs onto its customers. Its operating margin for the trailing 12 months was 15.1%. Entegris Operating Margin (GAAP) 3. Free Cash Flow Margin Dropping Free cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king. As you can see below, Entegris\u2019s margin dropped by 6.6 percentage points over the last five years. It may have ticked higher more recently, but shareholders are likely hoping for its margin to at least revert to its historical level. Almost any movement in the wrong direction is undesirable because of its relatively low cash conversion. If the longer-term trend returns, it could signal it\u2019s becoming a more capital-intensive business. Entegris\u2019s free cash flow margin for the trailing 12 months was 8.4%. Entegris Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin Final Judgment Entegris\u2019s business quality ultimately falls short of our standards. After the recent drawdown, the stock trades at 25.7\u00d7 forward price-to-earnings (or $100.53 per share). Investors with a higher risk tolerance might like the company, but we don\u2019t really see a big opportunity at the moment. We're pretty confident there are superior stocks to buy right now. We\u2019d suggest looking at one of our top software and edge computing picks .

(NASDAQ:ENTG) Delivered A Weaker ROE Than Its Industry editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sat, Jan 25, 2025, 4:42 PM 3 min read In This Article: ENTG -2.05% While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. We'll use ROE to examine Entegris, Inc. ( NASDAQ:ENTG ), by way of a worked example. Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Entegris How Is ROE Calculated? The formula for return on equity is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Entegris is: 6.4% = US$229m \u00f7 US$3.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024). The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.06 in profit. Does Entegris Have A Good ROE? One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below, Entegris has a lower ROE than the average (11%) in the Semiconductor industry classification. NasdaqGS:ENTG Return on Equity January 25th 2025 That certainly isn't ideal. That being said, a low ROE is not always a bad thing, especially if the company has low leverage as this still leaves room for improvement if the company were to take on more debt. When a company has low ROE but high debt levels, we would be cautious as the risk involved is too high. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Entegris visit our risks dashboard for free. Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROE Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking. Entegris' Debt And Its 6.4% ROE It's worth noting the high use of debt by Entegris, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.15. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it. Story Continues Summary Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better. Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 5 Growth Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Strong Momentum Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Market Update Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our 9 Best Market-Beating Stocks and add them to your watchlist.
