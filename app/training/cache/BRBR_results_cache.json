The global convenient nutrition category leader posted adjusted earnings of 51 cents per share in the last reported quarter, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2%. The company topped earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 16.84%. BRBR\u2019s Q1 Estimates For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for BellRing\u2019s revenues is pegged at $524.5 million, indicating an increase of 21.9% from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s first-quarter fiscal 2025 EPS suggests a 9.3% increase to 47 cents. Estimate Revision Trend Ahead of BRBR\u2019s Q1 Earnings Estimates for BellRing\u2019s Q1 earnings have remained constant at 47 cents in the past 90 days. Let\u2019s briefly review the company\u2019s performance leading up to this announcement. Factors Shaping BRBR\u2019s Q1 Performance The company is expected to have sustained the strong momentum of fiscal 2024, which marked the second consecutive year of significantly outpacing long-term algorithm growth and posted double-digit growth for the past four years. This positive trend is expected to have continued in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by increasing household penetration and a higher buy rate. In addition, ongoing\u00a0strong macro trends like the mainstreaming of protein, the growing popularity of functional foods and beverages, and the continued rise in healthy convenient foods are expected to have supported in bolstering its future growth potential. Building on a stellar fiscal 2024, Premier Protein, BellRing\u2019s largest brand, likely witnessed strong volume growth for both RTD shakes and powders. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Premier shake consumption is expected to have been boosted by strength in mass, food and e-commerce channels, driven by higher velocities, feature and display activity, along with distribution expansion in mass and food. BellRing Brands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise BellRing Brands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise BellRing Brands Inc. price-eps-surprise | BellRing Brands Inc. Quote Premier Protein powder reached over $75 million in net sales last fiscal, and likely maintained its strong growth trajectory, with consumption increasing beyond strong velocities and distribution gains. Meanwhile, mainstream every day and Sports Nutrition RTD brands may have continued to drive the most event growth. Ready-to-mix sales likely benefited from incremental feature and display activity. Together, these factors are expected to have made a positive impact on BellRing\u2019s fiscal 2025 first-quarter revenues. Story Continues Additionally, the Dymatize brand is expected to have retained a strong foothold in the powder category, with stable household penetration and overall distribution levels. Strength in Dymatize\u2019s international business likely boosted the company\u2019s overall top line in the to-be-reported quarter. In the United States, BellRing may have further invested more resources into marketing and promotion for Dymatize, further strengthening its position in the sports nutrition category. Operationally, inflation in the input costs is likely to have affected the gross margin performance in first-quarter 2025. BellRing may have significantly ramped up advertising promotion expenditures from the comparable period, mainly from the kick-off of the Premier Protein nationwide campaign. This is likely to have weighed on the adjusted EBITDA margins.
