[{"text": "LIVE The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs Jim Cramer Highlights Alliance Resource Partners (ARLP)\u2019s High Yield and Coal Success \u2013 Here\u2019s Why Syeda Seirut Javed Sat, Jan 25, 2025, 11:08 PM 5 min read In This Article: ARLP We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Recently Shed Light on These 9 Stocks . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. (NASDAQ:ARLP) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer recently highlighted. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently discussed a possible looming energy crisis in the U.S. that has taken many by surprise. He warned that if the country doesn\u2019t act swiftly, it will soon be overwhelmed by an energy shortfall. According to Cramer, we need to tap into every available energy source including natural gas, wind, geothermal, and hydroelectric power. However, he stressed that the most critical energy source right now is nuclear power. He added: \u201cCrisis comes down to the fact that we had no real industrial growth in this country for decades so we haven\u2019t had to build much energy infrastructure. Now all of a sudden these data centers start coming online like the ones that will be part of Stargate, the Oracle, SoftBank, OpenAI project\u2026 And these data centers consume insane amounts of electricity. It\u2019s a level of demand that nobody saw coming. So after years where we spent more time decommissioning power plants and building new ones, we suddenly gotta go back into growth mode.\u201d READ ALSO: 8 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar and Jim Cramer Discussed 9 Stocks for This Week\u2019s Game Plan Cramer went on to discuss an energy source that many are reluctant to consider: coal. While it may seem counterintuitive, he argued that coal could make a comeback in the U.S. energy mix. \u201cWhen the president gave his inaugural address on Monday, he declared a national emergency aiming to produce more domestic fossil fuels, including coal. Once the mainstay utility fuel, coal has been phased out year after year after year because it is terrible for the environment. 10 years ago, coal-based fuel was responsible [for] about 33% of electricity. Now it\u2019s fallen to 15%.\u201d Yet, with the push to decommission nuclear plants, and the rising cost of natural gas, Cramer suggested that coal might need to be reintegrated into the energy mix. He argued that, despite the environmental drawbacks, the demand for power is now so great that coal\u2019s long decline could be nearing its end. \u201cUnder this president, coal could have\u2026 a renaissance. Sure, coal\u2019s time has come and gone, but it will come again because the data center inspired energy crisis really is so pressing that there\u2019s not really a choice anymore. Yes, the demand is that great, [and] we so foolishly mothballed good nuke plants that it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if coal\u2019s long decline may have finally run its course.\u201d Story Continues Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 9 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the recent episode of Mad Money on January 22. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.

Jim Points to Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. (ARLP)'s High Yield and Coal Success \u2013 Here\u2019s Why A coal-loading terminal with trucks lined up to be loaded. Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. (NASDAQ: ARLP ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 5 Cramer mentioned Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. (NASDAQ:ARLP) during the episode, and here is what Mad Money\u2019s host had to say: \u201c\u2026 then there\u2019s another company called Alliance Resources Partners LP. It\u2019s a master limited partnership that\u2019s the largest coal producer in the eastern United States. Incredibly profitable company sells at less than nine times earnings as befits a slow to no growth enterprise and it\u2019s not undiscovered because coal prices have actually done well thanks to overseas demand. However, total revenues for the period decreased by 4.3%, reaching $1.86 billion compared to $1.94 billion in 2023, mainly due to lower coal sales and transportation revenues, though higher oil and gas royalties and other revenues helped offset the drop. Alliance Resource\u2019s (NASDAQ:ARLP) net income for the 2024 period was $344.5 million, or $2.64 per basic and diluted limited partner unit, down from $514.7 million, or $3.93 per unit, in 2023. The decrease in net income was primarily driven by the decline in revenues and an increase in total operating expenses. Overall, ARLP ranks 8th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer recently highlighted.

Market\u00a0Challenges \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Metallurgical coal is an essential resource in steel production, as it is used to create coke. The cost of metallurgical coal is influenced by global demand for iron and steel, making it more expensive than thermal coal. Prices for metallurgical coal are volatile due to macroeconomic factors, including global steel demand and trading policies of major consumers like China . For instance, India , the world's second-largest crude steel producer and a significant importer of coking coal, experienced a 49% increase in coking coal prices between May and November 2023 . These fluctuations make the market unreliable, with prices reaching as high as USD365 per ton in October 2023 . Despite predictions of falling prices, the value of Australia's metallurgical coal exports is expected to decrease due to these price fluctuations. The volatility of metallurgical coal prices acts as a barrier to market growth. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Metallurgical coal, including bituminous, sub-bituminous, lignite, and coking coal, plays a crucial role in industries like steelmaking and electricity generation. Coking coal's primary use is in steel production, where it transforms into carbon-rich coke during the coking process, essential for iron ore to produce pig iron in the steelmaking process. However, challenges persist. Coal quality factors like caking ability, ash content, volatile matter, sulfur, and phosphorus impact coke production efficiency and steel quality. In electricity generation, non-coking coal is used, but its heating process requires careful consideration due to its lower heating value and higher ash content. Coal classification, based on vitrinite content, helps determine coal's suitability for various uses. Coking coals have high vitrinite content, while non-coking coals have low vitrinity. Metallurgical coke production relies on coal's caking property and plasticity. The steel industry and thermal power plants face a demand-supply gap due to depleting coal reserves and increasing environmental concerns. Coal blending and characterization, including coal washing and coking index determination, are essential to optimize coal usage and improve product quality. Additionally, metallurgical coal is used in producing ferro-chromium, ferro-manganese, carbon electrodes, pesticides, chemical products, carbon fibers, and medicines. The challenges in the metallurgical coal market include ensuring consistent coal quality, managing the supply chain, and addressing environmental concerns.
