Jumps 18.2%: Will It Continue to Soar? Zacks Equity Research Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 12:43 PM 2 min read In This Article: BPMC Blueprint Medicines (BPMC) shares ended the last trading session 18.2% higher at $103.36. The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 6.2% loss over the past four weeks. The sudden soaring of the stock price was observed after Blueprint announced\u00a0its 2025 corporate outlook and growth strategy, highlighting plans to build on its established R&D and commercial expertise. Growth in 2025 is expected to be fuelled by Ayvakit sales, which is approved for gastrointestinal stromal tumors and\u00a0advanced and indolent systemic mastocytosis (SM). Per BPMC,\u00a0the SM franchise has a peak\u00a0revenue opportunity of $4 billion, with Ayvakit alone expected to achieve $2 billion in annual revenues by 2030. Additionally, pipeline is also progressing well. This cancer drug developer is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.49 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +73.1%. Revenues are expected to be $147.54 million, up 105% from the year-ago quarter. Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements. For Blueprint Medicines, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions. So, make sure to keep an eye on BPMC going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Skyrocketing Now Omor Ibne Ehsan Sun, Jan 26, 2025, 11:09 AM 3 min read In This Article: BPMC We recently compiled a list of the Why These 15 Stocks Are Skyrocketing in 2025 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Blueprint Medical (NASDAQ:BPMC) stands against the other stocks. Stock gains always get people talking, and 2025 is no exception. Markets have moved higher for a while due to a shift toward tech innovation. The pace might slow after two years of significant returns, but investors have regained their confidence after the Stargate project was announced. Small and mid-sized companies have started to pick up pace recently and are landing on investors\u2019 radars as mega-cap stocks are now trading at nosebleed valuations. These companies have higher growth potential than their mega-cap rivals, and that explains the sudden surge of interest. Smaller and mid-tier stocks did face challenges in prior years when corrections and interest rate hikes weighed on market sentiment. However, now that inflation seems more contained and Trump pushes for more rate cuts, things look even better for these mid-sized stocks. Methodology For this article, I screened the top-performing stocks year-to-date in the $5 billion to $20 billion market capitalization bracket. Stocks that I have covered recently will be excluded from this list. I will also mention the number of hedge fund investors in these stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. ( see more details here ). A doctor examining a patient's samples in a modern hospital setting. Blueprint Medical (NASDAQ: BPMC ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 37 Blueprint Medical (NASDAQ:BPMC) is a biopharma company that makes medicine for allergies, inflammation, and a number of cancers. The lead product here is AYVAKIT (avapritinib). It is approved for several forms of systemic mastocytosis, and the company\u2019s pipeline includes an oral KIT inhibitor called BLU-808, which is in development for allergic and inflammatory diseases. BPMC stock surged in 2025 due to it updating its long-term outlook and announcing new data. It reaffirmed a large revenue opportunity for its systemic mastocytosis franchise. In January 2025, it said that AYVAKIT\u2019s launch showed momentum and that new epidemiology data showed systemic mastocytosis was more common than previously thought. Not only that, Phase 1 results for BLU-808 came in positive. Story Continues Recent filings also show revenue gains have been solid, and losses have narrowed a lot more than previously expected. Management also guided for $475 million to $480 million in full-year 2024 AYVAKIT revenue. That means over 130% year-over-year growth. It forecasts AYVAKIT alone could reach $2 billion in annual revenue by 2030. Revenue from the overall systemic mastocytosis franchise could approach some $4 billion at its peak. The consensus analyst price target on BPMC stock is at $126, implying 8.9% upside. BPMC stock is up 32.57% year-to-date. Overall BPMC ranks 7th on our list of the stocks that are skyrocketing in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of BPMC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BPMC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock .

2025 Growth Strategy Zacks Equity Research Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 6:14 PM 5 min read In This Article: BPMC Shares of Blueprint Medicines BPMC rallied 18.2% on Monday driven by investor enthusiasm following the company\u2019s announcement of its 2025 corporate outlook and growth strategy, highlighting plans to build on its established R&D and commercial expertise. Blueprint\u2019s commercial portfolio only comprises its lead drug Ayvakit (avapritinib), an inhibitor of KIT and PDGFRA proteins,\u00a0which was initially approved in the United States and the EU to treat gastrointestinal stromal tumors in 2020. Later, the drug\u2019s label was expanded by respective regulatory authorities in both geographies to treat advanced and indolent systemic mastocytosis (SM). In the press release, BPMC has updated its projections for its SM franchise, driven by the strong global launch of Ayvakit, a significant increase in diagnosed SM patients, and new epidemiological data suggesting SM is more prevalent than previously estimated. The company now anticipates a peak revenue opportunity of $4 billion for the SM franchise, with Ayvakit alone expected to achieve $2 billion in annual revenues by 2030. The company anticipates reporting its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results in February 2025. In October 2024, Blueprint projected Ayvakit product revenues in the range of $475-$480 million for the year, marking growth of more than 130% compared with 2023. The growth trajectory of Ayvakit sales is expected to continue rising in 2025. Additionally, in 2025, the company will seek to achieve reimbursement of Ayvakit in 20 countries or more across the globe to ensure better patient access. In the past three months, BPMC shares have gained 15.9% against the\u00a0industry\u2019s 12.1% decline. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research BPMC Reports Upbeat Data From Its Phase I BLU-808 Study Blueprint is conducting an early-stage study of BLU-808 to assess its unique potency and selectivity, aiming to develop a flexible treatment approach and optimize the benefit-risk profile for a range of mast cell-driven diseases. BLU-808 is an oral wild-type KIT inhibitor. Per the data readout from the phase I single-ascending dose (SAD) and multiple-ascending dose (MAD) study, BLU-808 demonstrated dose-dependent serum tryptase responses, indicating mast cell target engagement across various dose levels. In the SAD cohorts, tryptase reductions were observed after a single dose, while the MAD cohorts showed rapid, robust and sustained tryptase reductions. Additionally, the candidate was overall well tolerated across all tested doses in the study. All treatment-related adverse events were mild in severity and did not result in discontinuations or dose modifications. Detailed results will be presented at an upcoming medical conference. Story Continues Based on the encouraging phase I data readout, Blueprint is initiating proof-of-concept studies on BLU-808 across a broad therapeutic area, including chronic urticaria, allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis and mast cell activation syndrome in 2025. Other Developmental Programs in BPMC\u2019s Clinical Pipeline To further bolster its footprint in the SM market, Blueprint is evaluating elenestinib (BLU-263) \u2014 a next-generation KIT inhibitor \u2014 in the phase II/III HARBOR study to treat patients with indolent SM. In the latest press release, BPMC announced that it has initiated the registration-enabling phase III portion of the study. Site activations and enrollment for the study are currently ongoing and will continue throughout 2025. Blueprint is accelerating the development of its CDK2 and CDK4 targeted protein degraders, focusing on their potential to achieve best-in-class profiles for treating breast cancer and other solid tumors. While the company is concluding the phase I study of its CDK2 inhibitor BLU-222 for breast cancer, it plans to shift investment away from this program. BPMC is actively exploring strategic partnerships to further expand its CDK franchise.

Industry: Biotech Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2396527/5-biotech-stocks-worth-adding-to-your-portfolio-in-2025 The macroenvironment in 2025 looks grim as signs of a slowdown in the economy set in. The biotech industry experienced a choppy ride in 2024, and the same is likely in store in 2025. Given the continuous need for innovative medical treatments, irrespective of the state of the economy, the biotech industry will continue to grab investors\u2019 interest despite the inherent volatility and uncertain macroeconomic environment. M&A activity is likely to accelerate in 2025 with a change in administration and expected deregulation. Pharma and biotech bigwigs always look to bolster their product portfolios and pipelines through collaborations and buyouts. While oncology and immuno-oncology companies have always been acquisition targets, those with obesity drugs in their portfolio/pipeline and gene-editing companies hold great potential. This will put the spotlight on smaller biotech companies with promising candidates in their kitty. Biotech companies like Incyte , BioMarin Pharmaceutical , Exelixis, Inc ., Halozyme Therapeutics and Blueprint Medicines are poised to outperform the volatile sector. Industry Description The Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry includes biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that develop high-profile drugs using path-breaking technology. These biologically processed drugs, which address virology, neuroscience, metabolism and rare diseases, are manufactured using live organisms. As technology becomes paramount to improving global health, biotech companies aim to use innovative technology to create breakthrough treatments rapidly. Quite a few companies in this space are developing drugs and vaccines using modern technology. Given the dynamic and evolving nature of technology, the sector is perceived to be riskier than the large-cap pharma or drug industry. 4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Biotech Industry Innovation, Execution Hold the Key : The primary focus in the biotech industry is on the performance of high-profile drugs and pipeline development, as only a handful of companies in this industry have approved drugs in their portfolios. Most companies spend millions and billions of dollars to create a drug with path-breaking technology, resulting in significant research and development expenditures. Sometimes, modern treatments come with side effects, which surface with time, and the uptake might fail to meet the expectations. Hence, it takes several years before a biotech company turns profitable. Story Continues Successful commercialization is the key to higher drug uptake, as smaller biotechs generally lack the funds and expertise to reach the targeted population. This prompts collaboration deals with either pharma or biotech bigwigs, wherein sales are shared, or royalties are received. Moreover, it may take quite a few years for any newly approved drug to contribute to its company\u2019s top line. M&A in Spotlight : Consolidation has always taken center stage in the biotech industry. This is because leading pharma/biotech companies constantly look to diversify their revenue base in the face of dwindling sales of their high-profile drugs. Acquisitions also make sense as developing a drug/technology from scratch is costly and risky. After a lull of almost two years, the pace of M&A has picked up from last year and is likely to accelerate in 2025. Pharma giant Johnson & Johnson recently announced that it would acquire all outstanding shares of biopharmaceutical company Intra-Cellular Therapies for a total equity value of approximately $14.6 billion. Biotech bigwig Biogen made an unsolicited, non-binding proposal offer to acquire Sage Therapeutics shares that it does not already own for $7.22 per share. While oncology and immuno-oncology are the key focus areas, treatments for obesity, rare diseases and gene-editing companies have gained traction in recent times, making them lucrative investment areas. An attractive pipeline candidate is the key lure for these companies. Cost synergies in research and development are added benefits, as quite a few smaller biotech companies are using innovative technologies to develop drugs and treatments. New Drug Approvals Boost Prospects : New drug approvals witnessed a surge in 2024. This trend is likely to see an acceleration in 2025 due to a continued rise in R&D spending, with most companies looking to diversify their portfolio. Pipeline Setbacks & Competition Hurt : Pipeline setbacks are key deterrents for biotech companies, given the exorbitant cost of developing drugs using expensive technology. Most drugs/therapies take years to gain a regulatory nod. An unfavorable outcome from a crucial trial on a promising candidate is a huge setback, particularly for smaller biotechs, which are mostly one-trick ponies. The leading biotechs face other headwinds, including declining sales of high-profile drugs due to intensifying competition. Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Decent Prospects The group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks. The Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #58, which places it among the top 23% of more than 250 Zacks industries. The rank mirrors a bright outlook for the space due to the consistent demand for better medical drugs/treatments, even though the macroenvironment is challenging. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Before we present a few biotech stocks that are well-positioned to beat the industry based on a strong portfolio/pipeline, let\u2019s take a look at the industry\u2019s stock market performance and current valuation. Industry Versus S&P 500 & Sector The Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry is a 703-stock group within the broader Zacks Medical sector. It has underperformed the S&P 500 composite and the Zacks Medical sector in the past year. The stocks in this industry have declined 16.3% in the past year compared with the Zacks Medical sector\u2019s loss of 7.3%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 composite has risen 23% in the said time frame. Industry's Current Valuation Since most companies in the biotech sector do not have approved drugs, valuing these companies becomes a complex process. On the basis of the trailing 12-month price-to-sales ratio (P/S TTM), which is commonly used for valuing biotech companies with approved portfolios of drugs, the industry is currently trading at 1.94X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 5.59 and the Zacks Medical sector's 3.22. Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 3.70X, as low as 1.84X and at a median of 2.33X. 5 Biotech Stocks Worth Buying BioMarin Pharmaceutical\u2019s key drugs, especially dwarfism drug Voxzogo, are witnessing strong demand, which is fueling sales. The label expansion of the drug in the United States and Europe for use in infants with achondroplasia is likely to boost sales further. BioMarin has an attractive early-stage pipeline with a focus on multiple diseases. The company currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings per share (EPS) has increased 5 cents to $3.29 in the past 90 days. The same for 2025 has risen 6 cents in this timeframe. Incyte \u2019s lead drug, Jakafi, maintains momentum on strong underlying demand. The FDA\u2019s approval of the ruxolitinib cream under the brand name Opzelura has boosted sales. The robust uptake of the drug is fueled by continued strong patient demand. The uptake of Pemazyre and other drugs like Monjuvi and Tabrecta has diversified the portfolio. The pipeline progress has also been good. Incyte currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Shares of the company have rallied 15.4% in a year. Exelixis \u2019 lead drug, Cabometyx, continues to be the leading tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The drug's use in combination with Opdivo in the first-line setting for RCC is driving demand and boosting sales. The potential label expansion of the drug into additional indications should boost sales. The pipeline progress has been impressive as well, as Exelixis looks to expand its oncology portfolio beyond Cabometyx. Exelixis currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 EPS has increased 10 cents to $1.94 and 18 cents to $2.03 for 2025 in the past 90 days. Shares of the company have surged 55.6% in the past 12 months. Halozyme Therapeutics has collaboration deals related to its ENHANZE technology with several large pharma companies that generate milestone payments, driving the top line. Robust demand for the subcutaneous formulation of Darzalex and Phesgo is boosting royalties and the top line. The momentum is likely to continue in future quarters. Halozyme is also focused on signing new collaboration deals to aid growth, which bodes well. Halozyme currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 EPS has increased 15 cents to $4.13 and 23 cents to $4.99 for 2025 in the past 90 days. Shares of the company have surged 57.3% in the past 12 months. Blueprint 's lead drug Ayvakit\u2019s sales have witnessed a strong uptake in the U.S. market. The drug was initially approved for treating gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and its label has since been expanded to treat adult patients with advanced and indolent systemic mastocytosis in both the U.S. and EU markets. The label expansion of the drug has been boosting its sales. Other promising candidates in the pipeline are also progressing well. Blueprint currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. Estimates for 2024 loss per share have narrowed to 96 cents from $1.29 in the past 90 days. Estimates for 2025 loss per share have also narrowed 37 cents. Shares of the company have rallied 24.6% in the past year. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Portfolio in 2025 Ekta Bagri Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 6:02 PM 8 min read In This Article: HALO BMRN EXEL INCY BPMC The macroenvironment in 2025 looks grim as signs of a slowdown in the economy set in. The biotech industry experienced a choppy ride in 2024, and the same is likely in store in 2025. Given the continuous need for innovative medical treatments, irrespective of the state of the economy, the biotech industry will continue to grab investors\u2019 interest despite the inherent volatility and uncertain macroeconomic environment. M&A activity is likely to accelerate in 2025 with a change in administration and expected deregulation. Pharma and biotech bigwigs always look to bolster their product portfolios and pipelines through collaborations and buyouts. While oncology and immuno-oncology companies have always been acquisition targets, those with obesity drugs in their portfolio/pipeline and gene-editing companies hold great potential. This will put the spotlight on smaller biotech companies with promising candidates in their kitty. Biotech companies like Incyte INCY, BioMarin Pharmaceutical BMRN, Exelixis, Inc , EXEL, Halozyme Therapeutics HALO and Blueprint Medicines BPMC are poised to outperform the volatile sector. Industry Description The Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry includes biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that develop high-profile drugs using path-breaking technology. These biologically processed drugs, which address virology, neuroscience, metabolism and rare diseases, are manufactured using live organisms. As technology becomes paramount to improving global health, biotech companies aim to use innovative technology to create breakthrough treatments rapidly. Quite a few companies in this space are developing drugs and vaccines using modern technology. Given the dynamic and evolving nature of technology, the sector is perceived to be riskier than the large-cap pharma or drug industry. 4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Biotech Industry Innovation, Execution Hold the Key : The primary focus in the biotech industry is on the performance of high-profile drugs and pipeline development, as only a handful of companies in this industry have approved drugs in their portfolios. Most companies spend millions and billions of dollars to create a drug with path-breaking technology, resulting in significant research and development expenditures. Sometimes, modern treatments come with side effects, which surface with time, and the uptake might fail to meet the expectations. Hence, it takes several years before a biotech company turns profitable. Successful commercialization is the key to higher drug uptake, as smaller biotechs generally lack the funds and expertise to reach the targeted population. This prompts collaboration deals with either pharma or biotech bigwigs, wherein sales are shared, or royalties are received. Moreover, it may take quite a few years for any newly approved drug to contribute to its company\u2019s top line. Story Continues M&A in Spotlight : Consolidation has always taken center stage in the biotech industry. This is because leading pharma/biotech companies constantly look to diversify their revenue base in the face of dwindling sales of their high-profile drugs. Acquisitions also make sense as developing a drug/technology from scratch is costly and risky. After a lull of almost two years, the pace of M&A has picked up from last year and is likely to accelerate in 2025. Pharma giant Johnson & Johnson recently announced that it would acquire all outstanding shares of biopharmaceutical company Intra-Cellular Therapies for a total equity value of approximately $14.6 billion. Biotech bigwig Biogen made an unsolicited, non-binding proposal offer to acquire Sage Therapeutics shares that it does not already own for $7.22 per share. While oncology and immuno-oncology are the key focus areas, treatments for obesity, rare diseases and gene-editing companies have gained traction in recent times, making them lucrative investment areas. An attractive pipeline candidate is the key lure for these companies. Cost synergies in research and development are added benefits, as quite a few smaller biotech companies are using innovative technologies to develop drugs and treatments. New Drug Approvals Boost Prospects : New drug approvals witnessed a surge in 2024. This trend is likely to see an acceleration in 2025 due to a continued rise in R&D spending, with most companies looking to diversify their portfolio. Pipeline Setbacks & Competition Hurt : Pipeline setbacks are key deterrents for biotech companies, given the exorbitant cost of developing drugs using expensive technology. Most drugs/therapies take years to gain a regulatory nod. An unfavorable outcome from a crucial trial on a promising candidate is a huge setback, particularly for smaller biotechs, which are mostly one-trick ponies. The leading biotechs face other headwinds, including declining sales of high-profile drugs due to intensifying competition. Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Decent Prospects The group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks. The Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #58, which places it among the top 23% of more than 250 Zacks industries. The rank mirrors a bright outlook for the space due to the consistent demand for better medical drugs/treatments, even though the macroenvironment is challenging. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Before we present a few biotech stocks that are well-positioned to beat the industry based on a strong portfolio/pipeline, let\u2019s take a look at the industry\u2019s stock market performance and current valuation. Industry Versus S&P 500 & Sector The Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry is a 703-stock group within the broader Zacks Medical sector. It has underperformed the S&P 500 composite and the Zacks Medical sector in the past year. The stocks in this industry have declined 16.3% in the past year compared with the Zacks Medical sector\u2019s loss of 7.3%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 composite has risen 23% in the said time frame. Price Performance Industry's Current Valuation Since most companies in the biotech sector do not have approved drugs, valuing these companies becomes a complex process. On the basis of the trailing 12-month price-to-sales ratio (P/S TTM), which is commonly used for valuing biotech companies with approved portfolios of drugs, the industry is currently trading at 1.94X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 5.59 and the Zacks Medical sector's 3.22. Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 3.70X, as low as 1.84X and at a median of 2.33X, as depicted in the chart below. 5 Biotech Stocks Worth Buying BioMarin Pharmaceutical\u2019s key drugs, especially dwarfism drug Voxzogo, are witnessing strong demand, which is fueling sales.

We have a number of commercial and clinical catalysts that we expect to deliver significant near- and long-term value to both patients and shareholders,\" said Kate Haviland , Chief Executive Officer of Blueprint Medicines. \"Driven by scalable innovation and operational excellence, we aspire to fundamentally shift the way many allergic and inflammatory diseases are treated by targeting the mast cell.\u00a0We have built a high-performing commercial engine that enables a truly integrated approach from research to development to commercialization, allowing us to realize operational efficiencies and resulting in a durable financial profile.\" Systemic Mastocytosis (SM): A Large and Growing Opportunity Based on the strength of the global AYVAKIT launch to date, significant sustained growth in diagnosed SM patients, and new epidemiology data suggesting SM prevalence is greater than previously thought, Blueprint now estimates the peak revenue opportunity for the company's SM franchise is $4 billion , with $2 billion in annual revenues expected to be achieved by AYVAKIT by 2030. Blueprint plans to report financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2024 in February 2025 . The company previously provided guidance in October 2024 for AYVAKIT product revenue of $475 to $480 million for full-year 2024, representing an increase of more than 130 percent over 2023. Positive Data from BLU-808 Healthy Volunteer Trial Blueprint today announced results from the Phase 1 single-ascending dose (SAD; n=56) and multiple-ascending dose (MAD; n=31, 14-day dosing) trial of BLU-808, a highly potent and selective oral wild type KIT inhibitor, in healthy volunteers. Detailed data will be presented at the J.P. Morgan conference. Story Continues Safety: BLU-808 was well-tolerated at all doses tested. All treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) in the MAD cohorts [1-12 mg once daily (QD)] in those who received BLU-808 were Grade 1. There were no serious AEs, no discontinuations or dose modifications due to AEs, and no significant changes in laboratory measures. Pharmacokinetics: BLU-808 showed a half-life of approximately 40 hours, enabling once-daily dosing, and consistent, dose-dependent increases in drug exposure. In the MAD cohorts, all BLU-808 doses led to sustained target coverage, with mean plasma concentrations exceeding predicted KIT IC 50 levels at \u22651 mg QD and IC 90 levels at \u22653 mg QD. Pharmacodynamics: BLU-808 showed dose-dependent serum tryptase responses, reflecting evidence of mast cell target engagement across multiple dose levels. In the SAD cohorts, reductions in tryptase were observed after a single dose of BLU-808. In the MAD cohorts, rapid, robust and sustained reductions in tryptase were observed, with reductions below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) at multiple dose levels. Change in Serum Tryptase (MAD) Dose Tryptase reduction at Day 15 Participants reaching LLOQ Placebo (n=8) -4\u00a0% 0 1 mg (n=6) -23\u00a0% 1/6 3 mg (n=6) -41\u00a0% 1/6 6 mg (n=6) -66\u00a0% 3/6 12 mg (n=4) a -87\u00a0% 3/4 a One participant in the 12 mg cohort had undetectable tryptase levels at baseline and was not included in the tryptase analysis. \"These Phase 1 data support the best-in-class potential of BLU-808, which was designed to achieve unique potency and selectivity enabling a tunable treatment approach and optimization of benefit-risk across a diverse set of mast cell-driven diseases,\" said Percy Carter , Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer at Blueprint Medicines. \"The results show that BLU-808 performed consistently, with dose-dependent outcomes, including rapid, robust and sustained reductions in serum tryptase across a range of doses, which reinforce the potential for tunable treatment. Based on these positive data, we are initiating proof-of-concept studies in chronic urticaria, allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis and mast cell activation syndrome to characterize BLU-808's broad therapeutic potential across multiple diseases where mast cells play a core role in the disease biology.\" Additional Pipeline Updates Blueprint continues to evaluate programs across the company's diverse pipeline and prioritize investments in the most compelling programs with first- or best-in-class potential. Blueprint today announced the following updates: With a focus driving continued innovation and extending the longer-term lifecycle of the company's SM franchise, Blueprint has initiated the registration-enabling Phase 3 HARBOR trial of elenestinib, a next-generation KIT D816V inhibitor, in patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM). Blueprint is advancing CDK2 and CDK4 targeted protein degraders, which have progressed faster than expected in preclinical development toward potentially best-in-class profiles and is prioritizing further investment in its CDK franchise for breast cancer and other solid tumors to these programs. Blueprint is completing the Phase 1 dose escalation study of its CDK2 inhibitor BLU-222 and plans to de-prioritize further investment in this program. The company continues to engage strategic partners on potential opportunities to broadly advance its franchise of CDK programs. 2025 Corporate Goals Grow franchise leadership in SM Deliver continued strong and steady AYVAKIT revenue growth in 2025 Present additional long-term data from the PIONEER trial of AYVAKIT in ISM in the first half of 2025 Achieve reimbursement of AYVAKYT in \u226520 countries overall by the end of 2025 Activate sites and drive patient enrollment of the Phase 3 HARBOR trial of elenestinib in ISM throughout 2025 Achieve BLU-808 clinical proof-of-concept in allergic and inflammatory diseases Present topline results from the Phase 1 healthy volunteer trial at the J.P.

BPMC\u2019s Q3 Results in Detail Blueprint Medicines\u2019 total revenues comprise net product revenues from Ayvakit/Ayvakyt and collaboration revenues. Out of the total revenues generated from Ayvakit sales in the third quarter, $113.1 million came from the U.S. sales of the drug and $15.1 million in ex-U.S. sales. The company did not recognize any collaboration, license and other revenues in the reported quarter. Research and development (R&D) expenses totaled $85.3 million, down 23% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s figure. The primary reason behind the decrease in R&D expenses was continued operational efficiency gains across the company\u2019s portfolio, along with favorable timing of manufacturing of clinical study materials. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $89.9 million, up 27% year over year. The uptick in such expenses was due to higher compensation and headcount costs related to the commercialization of Ayvakit/Ayvakyt.
