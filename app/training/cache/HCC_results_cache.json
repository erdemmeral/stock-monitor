Granted Can-Fite Namodenoson Patent for Use as anti-Obesity Drug Can-Fite BioPharma Ltd. Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 3:00 PM 6 min read In This Article: CANF -0.01% Can-Fite BioPharma Ltd. The Namodenoson oral drug is well positioned in the field of anti-obesity agents due to its activity and favorable safety profile Ramat Gan, Israel, Jan. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Can-Fite BioPharma Ltd . (NYSE American: CANF) (TASE:CANF), a biotechnology company advancing a pipeline of proprietary small molecule drugs that address oncological and inflammatory diseases, today announced that its lead drug candidate Namodenoson was granted a patent for its use as an anti-obesity drug by the US patent office.\u00a0 Namodenoson is currently being developed for the treatment of Metabolic Dysfunction-associated Steatohepatitis (MASH), advanced liver cancer and pancreatic cancer. In all clinical studies that have been conducted, Namodenoson had a very favorable safety profile when administered orally. The patent application No. 17/309,952 entitled \u201cAn A3 adenosine receptor ligand for use for achieving a fat loss effect\u201d, has been accepted by the US Patent Office, will be issued on February 2 nd and expires in 2042. The patent application covers methods of treating obese patients by administering Namodenoson in an oral formulation. Can-Fite has already multiple approved patents and corresponding applications in a variety of territories around the world, for different clinical applications of the drug. The anti-obesity patent application is based on data demonstrating that treatment of fat cells with Namodenoson reduced fat levels via the increase of the hormone adiponectin, a regulator of fat production in the body.\u00a0 Namodenoson also reduced body weight in an experimental animal model of obesity, induced by high fat diet. In a MASH Phase IIa study, in patients treated with Namodenoson, a 2.3% weight loss has been observed after 3 months with a significant increase in serum adiponectin levels. \u201dWe are delighted that the product protection of Namodenoson in the area of obesity has been accepted in the US and will be valid till 2042. Namodenoson is currently being developed for the treatment of MASH in a Phase IIb study where most patients are obese. We look forward to seeing the anti-obesity effect in this clinical study\u201d, said Motti Farbstein, Can-Fite CE&CFO. The obesity treatment industry worldwide is expected to reach a projected revenue of US$ 60.5 billion by 2030. A compound annual growth rate of 22.3% is expected of the worldwide obesity treatment industry from 2025 2030. About Namodenoson Namodenoson is a small orally bioavailable drug that binds with high affinity and selectivity to the A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR). Namodenoson is currently being evaluated in a pivotal Phase III trial for advanced liver cancer, a Phase IIb trial for the treatment of Metabolic Dysfunction-associated Steatohepatitis (MASH), and in a Phase IIa study in pancreatic cancer. A3AR is highly expressed in diseased cells whereas low expression is found in normal cells. This differential expression may be one of the important factors that accounts for the excellent safety profile of the drug. Story Continues About Can-Fite BioPharma Ltd. Can-Fite BioPharma Ltd.

At a median follow-up of 47 months, Opdivo plus Yervoy demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the dual-primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) versus Opdivo monotherapy (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.48\u20130.81; P = 0.0003). These results will be featured in a late-breaking oral presentation (LBA143) at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium on January 25 at 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time, in San Francisco, California and published the same day in The Lancet . Previous results from CheckMate -8HW, evaluating Opdivo plus Yervoy versus investigator\u2019s choice of chemotherapy, demonstrated that Opdivo plus Yervoy reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 79%. The results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine and were the basis for a European Commission approval for first-line patients with MSI-H/dMMR mCRC in December 2024. \"The benefit of dual inhibition of PD-1 and CTLA-4 has been well established in Phase 3 trials of Opdivo plus Yervoy across a broad range of tumor types, including in MSI-H/dMMR mCRC compared to chemotherapy,\" said Dana Walker, M.D., M.S.C.E., vice president, global program lead, late development, oncology, Bristol Myers Squibb. \"The results from this analysis of the CheckMate -8HW trial answer affirmatively an important question about whether dual I/O therapy with Opdivo plus Yervoy can also improve outcomes for patients with MSI-H/dMMR mCRC compared with Opdivo alone.\" Story Continues Results from the CheckMate -8HW trial at a median follow-up of 47 months in patients with MSI-H/dMMR mCRC across all lines of therapy include: PFS (progression-free survival; dual primary endpoint): Opdivo plus Yervoy demonstrated a 38% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death versus Opdivo monotherapy [HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.48\u20130.81; P = 0.0003]. PFS rates at 12-, 24-, and 36-months were also higher compared to Opdivo monotherapy (76%, 71% and 68% versus 63%, 56% and 51%, respectively). ORR (overall response rate; secondary endpoint): ORR by BICR was significantly higher with Opdivo plus Yervoy compared to Opdivo monotherapy [71% vs 58%; P = 0.0011]. Safety: The safety profile for the combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy remained consistent with previously reported data and was manageable with established protocols. Grade 3/4 TRAEs were reported in 22% of patients with Opdivo plus Yervoy and 14% of patients with Opdivo. No new safety signals were identified. \"The data presented today confirm nivolumab plus ipilimumab as a new standard treatment for people living with metastatic colorectal cancer given the evidence observed in both disease-free survival and response rate,\" said Thierry Andre, M.D., Head of the Medical Oncology Department, Sorbonne University and Hospital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France. \"Importantly, no new safety signals were identified, with a moderate increase of treatment-related adverse events, mostly grade 1 or 2, observed with the combination. Together, these data reaffirm the benefit of dual immunotherapy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab for this population of patients who urgently need improved treatment options.\" The study is ongoing to assess secondary endpoints, including overall survival (OS). Bristol Myers Squibb thanks the patients and investigators involved in the CheckMate -8HW clinical trial. About CheckMate -8HW CheckMate -8HW (NCT04008030) is a Phase 3 randomized, open-label trial evaluating Opdivo plus Yervoy compared to Opdivo alone or the investigator\u2019s choice chemotherapy (mFOLFOX-6 or FOLFIRI with or without bevacizumab or cetuximab) in patients with microsatellite instability\u2013high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). 839 patients were randomized to receive either Opdivo monotherapy ( Opdivo 240 mg Q2W for six doses, followed by Opdivo 480 mg Q4W), Opdivo plus Yervoy (Opdivo 240 mg plus Yervoy 1 mg/kg Q3W for four doses, followed by Opdivo 480 mg Q4W ), or investigator\u2019s choice of chemotherapy. The dual primary endpoints of the trial are progression-free survival (PFS) per blinded independent central review (BICR) for Opdivo plus Yervoy compared to investigator\u2019s choice of chemotherapy in the first-line setting and PFS per BICR for Opdivo plus Yervoy compared to Opdivo alone across all lines of therapy. About dMMR or MSI-H Colorectal Cancer Colorectal cancer (CRC) is cancer that develops in the colon or the rectum, which are part of the body\u2019s digestive or gastrointestinal system. CRC is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world. In 2020, it is estimated that there were approximately 1,931,000 new cases of the disease; it is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men and women combined. Mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) occurs when the proteins that repair mismatch errors in DNA replication are missing or non-functional, leading to microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors. Approximately 5-7% of metastatic CRC patients have dMMR or MSI-H tumors. These patients are less likely to benefit from conventional chemotherapy and typically have a poor prognosis. Bristol Myers Squibb: Creating a Better Future for People with Cancer Bristol Myers Squibb is inspired by a single vision \u2014 transforming patients\u2019 lives through science. The goal of the company\u2019s cancer research is to deliver medicines that offer each patient a better, healthier life and to make cure a possibility. Building on a legacy across a broad range of cancers that have changed survival expectations for many, Bristol Myers Squibb researchers are exploring new frontiers in personalized medicine and, through innovative digital platforms, are turning data into insights that sharpen their focus. Deep understanding of causal human biology, cutting-edge capabilities and differentiated research programs uniquely position the company to approach cancer from every angle. Cancer can have a relentless grasp on many parts of a patient\u2019s life, and Bristol Myers Squibb is committed to taking actions to address all aspects of care, from diagnosis to survivorship. As a leader in cancer care, Bristol Myers Squibb is working to empower all people with cancer to have a better future. About Opdivo Opdivo is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body\u2019s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response. By harnessing the body\u2019s own immune system to fight cancer, Opdivo has become an important treatment option across multiple cancers. Opdivo \u2019s leading global development program is based on Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s scientific expertise in the field of Immuno-Oncology and includes a broad range of clinical trials across all phases, including Phase 3, in a variety of tumor types. To date, the Opdivo clinical development program has treated more than 35,000 patients. The Opdivo trials have contributed to gaining a deeper understanding of the potential role of biomarkers in patient care, particularly regarding how patients may benefit from Opdivo across the continuum of PD-L1 expression. In July 2014, Opdivo was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world. Opdivo is currently approved in more than 65 countries, including the United States, the European Union, Japan and China. In October 2015, the Company\u2019s Opdivo and Yervoy combination regimen was the first Immuno-Oncology combination to receive regulatory approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and is currently approved in more than 50 countries, including the United States and the European Union. About Yervoy Yervoy is a recombinant, human monoclonal antibody that binds to the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activity. Yervoy binds to CTLA-4 and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation, including the activation and proliferation of tumor infiltrating T-effector cells. Inhibition of CTLA-4 signaling can also reduce T-regulatory cell function, which may contribute to a general increase in T-cell responsiveness, including the anti-tumor immune response. On March 25, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Yervoy 3 mg/kg monotherapy for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Yervoy is approved for unresectable or metastatic melanoma in more than 50 countries. There is a broad, ongoing development program in place for Yervoy spanning multiple tumor types.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions Immune-mediated adverse reactions listed herein may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment, they can also occur after discontinuation of OPDIVO or YERVOY. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of OPDIVO and YERVOY. Monitor for signs and symptoms that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate clinical chemistries including liver enzymes, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment with OPDIVO and before each dose of YERVOY. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information). In general, if OPDIVO or YERVOY interruption or discontinuation is required, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below. Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune- mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.1% (61/1994) of patients, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (2.1%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune- mediated pneumonitis occurred in 7% (31/456) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.2%), Grade 3 (2.0%), and Grade 2 (4.4%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune- mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.9% (26/666) of patients, including Grade 3 (1.4%) and Grade 2 (2.6%). In NSCLC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, immune- mediated pneumonitis occurred in 9% (50/576) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.5%), Grade 3 (3.5%), and Grade 2 (4.0%). Four patients (0.7%) died due to pneumonitis. In Checkmate 205 and 039, pneumonitis, including interstitial lung disease, occurred in 6.0% (16/266) of patients receiving OPDIVO. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 4.9% (13/266) of patients receiving OPDIVO, including Grade 3 (n=1) and Grade 2 (n=12). Immune-Mediated Colitis OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may be fatal. A common symptom included in the definition of colitis was diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 2.9% (58/1994) of patients, including Grade 3 (1.7%) and Grade 2 (1%). In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 25% (115/456) of patients, including Grade 4 (0.4%), Grade 3 (14%) and Grade 2 (8%).

OPDIVO in combination with cabozantinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher frequencies of Grade 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to OPDIVO alone. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. In patients receiving OPDIVO and cabozantinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT or AST were seen in 11% of patients. Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, immune-mediated hypophysitis, immune-mediated thyroid disorders, and Type 1 diabetes mellitus, which can present with diabetic ketoacidosis. Withhold OPDIVO and YERVOY depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information). For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism; initiate hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism; initiate hormone replacement or medical management as clinically indicated. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes; initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, adrenal insufficiency occurred in 1% (20/1994), including Grade 3 (0.4%) and Grade 2 (0.6%).

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of <1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received OPDIVO monotherapy or OPDIVO in combination with YERVOY or were reported with the use of other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions: cardiac/vascular: myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; nervous system: meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; ocular: uveitis, iritis, and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur; gastrointestinal: pancreatitis to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; musculoskeletal and connective tissue: myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis, and associated sequelae including renal failure, arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica; endocrine: hypoparathyroidism; other (hematologic/immune): hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection. In addition to the immune-mediated adverse reactions listed above, across clinical trials of YERVOY monotherapy or in combination with OPDIVO, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions, some with fatal outcome, occurred in <1% of patients unless otherwise specified: nervous system: autoimmune neuropathy (2%), myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis, motor dysfunction; cardiovascular: angiopathy, temporal arteritis; ocular: blepharitis, episcleritis, orbital myositis, scleritis; gastrointestinal: pancreatitis (1.3%); other (hematologic/immune): conjunctivitis, cytopenias (2.5%), eosinophilia (2.1%), erythema multiforme, hypersensitivity vasculitis, neurosensory hypoacusis, psoriasis. Some ocular IMAR cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada\u2013like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving OPDIVO and YERVOY, as this may require treatment with systemic corticosteroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss. Infusion-Related Reactions OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause severe infusion-related reactions. Discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY in patients with severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) infusion-related reactions. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In a separate trial in which patients received OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion or a 30- minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 2.7% (10/369) of patients, respectively. Additionally, 0.5% (2/368) and 1.4% (5/369) of patients, respectively, experienced adverse reactions within 48 hours of infusion that led to dose delay, permanent discontinuation or withholding of OPDIVO. In melanoma patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients. In HCC patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 8% (4/49) of patients. In RCC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 5.1% (28/547) of patients. In MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 4.2% (5/119) of patients. In MPM patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 12% (37/300) of patients. Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with OPDIVO or YERVOY. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between OPDIVO or YERVOY and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with OPDIVO and YERVOY prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. The effects of YERVOY are likely to be greater during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with OPDIVO and YERVOY and for at least 5 months after the last dose. Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when OPDIVO is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone In randomized clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of OPDIVO to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials. Lactation There are no data on the presence of OPDIVO or YERVOY in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 5 months after the last dose.

survival outcomes for camrelizumab plus rivoceranib in patients with viral and non-viral hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) demonstrated clinically meaningful overall survival and progression-free survival benefit for patients with hepatitis B or C viral infection HCC or non-viral HCC Results presented at ASCO GI January 24 showing favorable survival benefit of using camrelizumab plus rivoceranib as first-line treatment for patients with unresectable HCC, independent of etiology FORT LEE, N.J., Jan. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Elevar Therapeutics, Inc., a portfolio company of HLB Co., Ltd., today announced the results from a post-hoc analysis of the international CARES-310 study evaluating camrelizumab plus rivoceranib vs. sorafenib as a first-line treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) of viral and non-viral etiology. The post-hoc analysis will be presented in a poster at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium\u00a0(ASCO GI)\u00a0on January 24. \"This post-hoc analysis of uHCC patients treated with camrelizumab and rivoceranib demonstrated consistent survival benefits across subgroups with hepatitis B, hepatitis C and non-viral etiologies. The exploratory analysis revealed clinically meaningful improvements in both overall survival and progression-free survival, agnostic of the underlying etiology. Importantly, the safety profile of the combination therapy remained manageable and comparable across all subgroups,\" commented Chris Galloway, M.D., senior vice president of clinical development and medical affairs at Elevar. Results: Median overall survival (mOS) was longer with camrelizumab plus rivoceranib compared with sorafenib in patients with non-viral (HR 0.68 [95% CI 0.39, 1.19]), HCV (HR 0.37 [95% CI 0.162, 0.84]), and HBV etiologies (HR 0.70 [95% CI 0.55, 0.89]). Similarly, median progression free survival (mPFS) was longer with camrelizumab plus rivoceranib compared with sorafenib in patients with non-viral (HR 0.55 [95% CI 0.34, 0.91]), HCV (HR 0.50 [95% CI 0.23, 1.06]), and HBV etiologies (HR 0.57 [95% CI 0.45, 0.72]) i . The analysis concluded camrelizumab plus rivoceranib in CARES-310 suggested clinically meaningful mOS benefit in non-viral and viral HCC vs sorafenib and provides assurance of clinical benefit for first line treatment to patients with uHCC independent of etiology. ii 2025 ASCO GI Poster Session Information Poster Session B, Cancers of the Pancreas, Small Bowel and Hepatobiliary Tract: Clinical outcomes of camrelizumab + rivoceranib vs sorafenib (CARES-310) as first-line treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) of non-viral and viral etiology. Story Continues Abstract: 578 Poster Bd#: C4 Presenter: Rachna T. Shroff, MD, FASCO About CARES-310 The CARES-310 study, an international, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 trial, with 543 patients with uHCC who had not previously received systemic treatment was the first to demonstrate significant progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) benefits with immunotherapy plus an anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) over standard TKI as first-line treatment for uHCC. In the primary analysis of PFS (data cut-off [DCO], May 10, 2021) and interim analysis of OS (DCO, Feb. 8, 2022), significant improvements were observed with camrelizumab (C; anti-PD-1 antibody) + rivoceranib (R; VEGFR2-TKI) vs . sorafenib (S). In the final analysis (FA) of the CARES-310 study, after an additional follow-up of ~16 months, median OS was significantly prolonged with C+R vs. S (23.8 mo [95% CI 20.6-27.2] vs. 15.2 mo [95% CI 13.2-18.5]; hazard ratio (HR) 0.64 [95% CI 0.52-0.79]; 1-sided p <0.0001). OS rate with C+R vs. S was 49.0% vs. 32.6% at 24 mo, and 37.7% vs. 24.8% at 36 mo. OS benefits with C+R was generally consistent across subgroups, regardless of geographical region, race, and etiology. Benefits in PFS, objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR) with C+R vs . S were also sustained after prolonged follow-up. Safety data aligned with the interim OS analysis, with no new signals noted.\u00a0In the FA, C+R continued to show clinically meaningful survival improvement compared with S, with manageable safety. The extended follow-up further confirmed the favorable benefit-to-risk profile of C+R, supporting it as a new first-line treatment option for uHCC. About Hepatocellular Carcinoma Worldwide each year more than 800,000 people are diagnosed with liver cancer\u00a0and the disease is the cause of more than 830,000 deaths.\u00a0Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer and most frequently develops in people with chronic underlying liver inflammation which may be from viral and non-viral causes. HCC typically has a poor prognosis with limited treatment options and continues to be a diagnosis with an ongoing urgent medical need. About Rivoceranib Rivoceranib, a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is a highly selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs), a primary pathway for tumor angiogenesis. VEGFR inhibition is a clinically validated target to limit tumor growth and disease progression. Rivoceranib is currently being studied as a monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy and immunotherapy in various solid tumor indications. Several clinical studies were completed in patients with \u00a0uHCC (in combination with camrelizumab), gastric cancer (as a monotherapy and in combination with paclitaxel), adenoid cystic carcinoma (as a monotherapy) and colorectal cancer (in combination with Lonsurf \u00ae ). Rivoceranib, under the name apatinib (Aitan \u00ae ), was the first TKI approved in gastric cancer in China (October 2014). It was also approved in China in combination with camrelizumab as a first-line treatment for uHCC (January 2023). The drug has been studied in more than 6,000 patients worldwide and was well tolerated in clinical trials with a comparable safety profile to other TKIs and VEGF inhibitors. Orphan drug designations have been granted for gastric cancer (U.S., EU and South Korea), adenoid cystic carcinoma (U.S.) and uHCC (U.S. and EU). Elevar Therapeutics, Inc. holds the global rights (excluding China) to rivoceranib and has partnered for its development and marketing with HLB-LS in South Korea. Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals Company Ltd., (Hengrui Pharma), is the Chinese -territory license-holder of rivoceranib. About Camrelizumab Camrelizumab (SHR-1210) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor. Blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway is a therapeutic strategy showing success in a wide variety of solid and hematological cancers. Camrelizumab is developed by Hengrui Pharma and has been studied in more than 5,000 patients. Currently, 50 clinical trials are underway in a broad range of tumors (including liver cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, and breast cancer, etc.) and treatment settings. Camrelizumab, under the brand name AiRuiKa \u00ae , is currently approved for eight indications in China, including monotherapy for the treatment of HCC (second-line), in combination with rivoceranib as a treatment for uHCC (first-line), relapsed/refractory classic Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (third-line), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (second-line) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (third-line or further) and in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (non-squamous and squamous), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma in the first-line setting. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted Orphan Drug Designation to camrelizumab for advanced HCC in April 2021 and by the European Medicines Agency in August 2024. In October 2023, Elevar licensed camrelizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, for commercialization from Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (Hengrui Pharma) worldwide excluding Greater China and Korea.

CABINET Pivotal Study Evaluating Cabozantinib in Advanced Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors Presented at ASCO GI 2025 Business Wire Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 10:30 PM 18 min read In This Article: EXEL +1.45% \u2013 Cabozantinib reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 50 percent compared with placebo in patients with advanced gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors \u2013 \u2013 Supplemental New Drug Application under review with the U.S. FDA for cabozantinib for the treatment of patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors based on findings from CABINET \u2013 ALAMEDA, Calif., January 24, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Exelixis, Inc. (Nasdaq: EXEL) today announced results from a subgroup analysis of the phase 3 CABINET pivotal study of patients with extra-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (epNET) arising in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The analysis showed cabozantinib was associated with an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo in patients with advanced GI neuroendocrine tumors (NET), which was a subgroup of the epNET cohort. These results are being presented today during Poster Session B: Cancers of the Pancreas, Small Bowel, and Hepatobiliary Tract, at 11:30 a.m. PT on January 24 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2025 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium (ASCO GI 2025). \"Treating neuroendocrine tumors after disease progression can be challenging, including for those with tumors in the gastrointestinal tract, as treatment options are limited,\" said Jonathan Strosberg, M.D., President Emeritus, North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society and Chair, GI Research Program, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute. \"This subgroup analysis from the CABINET study showed that cabozantinib improved progression-free survival for patients with tumors arising in the GI tract and provides a more detailed picture of how patients with the most common form of this cancer may benefit from this treatment. As a physician, I\u2019m encouraged by these findings, as they suggest cabozantinib has potential to become a standard of care for patients greatly in need of new options.\" This subgroup analysis included 116 of the 203 patients in the epNET cohort. The most common primary tumor locations were ileum/cecum (54%), small intestine with location not specified (20%), non-cecum colon or rectum (11%), stomach (4%), duodenum (3%), jejunum (3%) and non-specified midgut site (3%). Cabozantinib was associated with improved PFS by blinded independent central review compared with placebo for patients with GI NET (hazard ratio: 0.50; 95% confidence interval: 0.28-0.88; one-sided stratified log-rank P=0.007). Median PFS was 8.5 months with cabozantinib compared with 5.6 months with placebo. Cabozantinib demonstrated potential benefit across clinical factors, including grade, functional status, concurrent somatostatin agent use, and prior therapy with Lu-177 dotatate or everolimus. One patient achieved a partial response with cabozantinib versus none with placebo, and 48 versus 30 patients, respectively, achieved stable disease. Story Continues \"These new data add to the robust results from the CABINET trial that demonstrate the benefits of cabozantinib across a wide range of patients with neuroendocrine tumors and further underscore the potential of cabozantinib to become a much-needed new option for those with GI NET, which accounts for the majority of real-world patients with this tumor type,\" said Amy Peterson, M.D., Executive Vice President, Product Development & Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Officer, Exelixis. \"We look forward to continuing to work with the U.S. FDA as they review our regulatory application for cabozantinib for the treatment of patients with previously treated advanced neuroendocrine tumors.\" The safety profile of cabozantinib observed in patients with GI NET was consistent with its known safety profile; no new safety signals were identified. The most frequent grade 3/4 adverse events included hypertension (19% of patients receiving cabozantinib and 4% receiving placebo), diarrhea (13% and 4%, respectively) and fatigue (10% and 4%). Three grade 5 events occurred in the cabozantinib arm possibly related to cabozantinib: one due to cardiac arrest and two not specified. As announced in August 2023, the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board unanimously recommended that the CABINET trial be stopped early and unblinded due to the substantial improvement in PFS observed at an interim analysis. Final PFS results were presented at the 2024 European Society of Medical Oncology Congress and published concurrently in the New England Journal of Medicine . In August 2024, Exelixis announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had accepted the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for cabozantinib for the treatment of previously treated, advanced NET and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act target action date of April 3, 2025. About CABINET (Alliance A021602) CABINET (Randomized, Double-Blinded Phase III Study of CAB ozantinib versus Placebo I n Patients with Advanced NE uroendocrine T umors After Progression on Prior Therapy) is sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and is being led and conducted by the NCI-funded Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology with participation from the NCI-funded National Clinical Trials Network as part of Exelixis\u2019 collaboration through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the NCI\u2019s Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program. CABINET is a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 3 pivotal trial that had enrolled a total of 298 patients in the U.S at the time of the final analysis. Patients were randomized 2:1 to cabozantinib (60 mg) or placebo in two separately powered cohorts (pancreatic NET, n=95; epNET, n=203). The epNET cohort included patients with the following primary tumor sites: GI tract, lung, unknown primary sites, and other organs. Each cohort was randomized separately and had its own statistical analysis plan. Patients must have had measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria and must have experienced disease progression or intolerance after at least one U.S. FDA-approved line of prior systemic therapy other than somatostatin analogs. The primary endpoint in each cohort was PFS per RECIST 1.1 by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, objective response rate and safety. More information about this trial is available at ClinicalTrials.gov . About NET NET are cancers that begin in the specialized cells of the body\u2019s neuroendocrine system. 1 These cells have traits of both hormone-producing endocrine cells and nerve cells. 1 In 2024, the estimated prevalence of NET in the U.S. was more than 380,000 people. 2 It is estimated that 161,000 to 192,000 people are living with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic NET. 2 The number of people diagnosed with NET has been increasing in recent decades. 3 Functional NET release peptide hormones that can cause debilitating symptoms, like diarrhea, hypertension and flushing, which may require focused treatment, while symptoms of non-functional NET are related primarily to tumor growth. 4,5 Most NET take years to develop and grow slowly, but eventually all patients with advanced or metastatic NET will develop refractory and progressing disease. 6,7 NET can develop in any part of the body, but most commonly start in the GI tract or in the lungs, where they have historically been referred to as carcinoid tumors and are more recently called epNET. 1 The five-year survival rates for advanced GI and lung NET tumors are 68% and 55%, respectively. 8,9 NET can also start in the pancreas, where they tend to be more aggressive, with a five-year survival rate of only 23% for advanced disease. 1,10 For advanced NET patients, treatment options include somatostatin analogs, chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy and peptide-receptor radionuclide therapy. 11 About CABOMETYX \u00ae (cabozantinib) In the U.S., CABOMETYX tablets are approved as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and in combination with nivolumab for patients as a first-line treatment for patients with advanced RCC; for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have been previously treated with sorafenib, and; for adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) that has progressed following prior VEGFR-targeted therapy and who are radioactive iodine-refractory or ineligible. CABOMETYX tablets have also received regulatory approvals in over 65 countries outside the U.S. and Japan, including the European Union. In 2016, Exelixis granted Ipsen Pharma SAS exclusive rights for the commercialization and further clinical development of cabozantinib outside of the U.S. and Japan. In 2017, Exelixis granted exclusive rights to Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited for the commercialization and further clinical development of cabozantinib for all future indications in Japan. Exelixis holds the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize cabozantinib in the U.S. CABOMETYX is not indicated as a treatment for NET. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hemorrhage: Severe and fatal hemorrhages occurred with CABOMETYX. The incidence of Grade 3 to 5 hemorrhagic events was 5% in CABOMETYX patients in RCC, HCC, and DTC studies. Discontinue CABOMETYX for Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage and prior to surgery as recommended. Do not administer CABOMETYX to patients who have a recent history of hemorrhage, including hemoptysis, hematemesis, or melena. Perforations and Fistulas: Fistulas, including fatal cases, occurred in 1% of CABOMETYX patients. Gastrointestinal (GI) perforations, including fatal cases, occurred in 1% of CABOMETYX patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of fistulas and perforations, including abscess and sepsis. Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who experience a Grade 4 fistula or a GI perforation. Thrombotic Events: CABOMETYX increased the risk of thrombotic events. Venous thromboembolism occurred in 7% (including 4% pulmonary embolism) and arterial thromboembolism in 2% of CABOMETYX patients. Fatal thrombotic events occurred in CABOMETYX patients. Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who develop an acute myocardial infarction or serious arterial or venous thromboembolic events that require medical intervention. Hypertension and Hypertensive Crisis: CABOMETYX can cause hypertension, including hypertensive crisis. Hypertension was reported in 37% (16% Grade 3 and <1% Grade 4) of CABOMETYX patients. Do not initiate CABOMETYX in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Monitor blood pressure regularly during CABOMETYX treatment. Withhold CABOMETYX for hypertension that is not adequately controlled with medical management; when controlled, resume at a reduced dose. Permanently discontinue CABOMETYX for severe hypertension that cannot be controlled with anti-hypertensive therapy or for hypertensive crisis. Diarrhea: Diarrhea occurred in 62% of CABOMETYX patients. Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 10% of CABOMETYX patients. Monitor and manage patients using antidiarrheals as indicated. Withhold CABOMETYX until improvement to \u2264 Grade 1, resume at a reduced dose. Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia (PPE): PPE occurred in 45% of CABOMETYX patients. Grade 3 PPE occurred in 13% of CABOMETYX patients. Withhold CABOMETYX until improvement to Grade 1 and resume at a reduced dose for intolerable Grade 2 PPE or Grade 3 PPE. Hepatotoxicity: CABOMETYX in combination with nivolumab can cause hepatic toxicity with higher frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to CABOMETYX alone. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes than when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt CABOMETYX and nivolumab and consider administering corticosteroids. With the combination of CABOMETYX and nivolumab, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT or AST were seen in 11% of patients. ALT or AST >3 times ULN (Grade \u22652) was reported in 83 patients, of whom 23 (28%) received systemic corticosteroids; ALT or AST resolved to Grades 0-1 in 74 (89%). Among the 44 patients with Grade \u22652 increased ALT or AST who were rechallenged with either CABOMETYX (n=9) or nivolumab (n=11) as a single agent or with both (n=24), recurrence of Grade \u22652 increased ALT or AST was observed in 2 patients receiving CABOMETYX, 2 patients receiving nivolumab, and 7 patients receiving both CABOMETYX and nivolumab. Withhold and resume at a reduced dose based on severity. Adrenal Insufficiency: CABOMETYX in combination with nivolumab can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold CABOMETYX and/or nivolumab and resume CABOMETYX at a reduced dose depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 4.7% (15/320) of patients with RCC who received CABOMETYX with nivolumab, including Grade 3 (2.2%), and Grade 2 (1.9%) adverse reactions. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of CABOMETYX and nivolumab in 0.9% and withholding of CABOMETYX and nivolumab in 2.8% of patients with RCC. Approximately 80% (12/15) of patients with adrenal insufficiency received hormone replacement therapy, including systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency resolved in 27% (n=4) of the 15 patients. Of the 9 patients in whom CABOMETYX with nivolumab was withheld for adrenal insufficiency, 6 reinstated treatment after symptom improvement; of these, all (n=6) received hormone replacement therapy and 2 had recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. Proteinuria: Proteinuria was observed in 8% of CABOMETYX patients. Monitor urine protein regularly during CABOMETYX treatment. For Grade 2 or 3 proteinuria, withhold CABOMETYX until improvement to \u2264 Grade 1 proteinuria; resume CABOMETYX at a reduced dose. Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ): ONJ occurred in <1% of CABOMETYX patients. ONJ can manifest as jaw pain, osteomyelitis, osteitis, bone erosion, tooth or periodontal infection, toothache, gingival ulceration or erosion, persistent jaw pain, or slow healing of the mouth or jaw after dental surgery. Perform an oral examination prior to CABOMETYX initiation and periodically during treatment. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices. Withhold CABOMETYX for at least 3 weeks prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. Withhold CABOMETYX for development of ONJ until complete resolution, resume at a reduced dose. Impaired Wound Healing: Wound complications occurred with CABOMETYX. Withhold CABOMETYX for at least 3 weeks prior to elective surgery. Do not administer CABOMETYX for at least 2 weeks after major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of CABOMETYX after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS): RPLS, a syndrome of subcortical vasogenic edema diagnosed by characteristic findings on MRI, can occur with CABOMETYX. Evaluate for RPLS in patients presenting with seizures, headache, visual disturbances, confusion, or altered mental function. Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who develop RPLS. Thyroid Dysfunction: Thyroid dysfunction, primarily hypothyroidism, has been observed with CABOMETYX. Based on the safety population, thyroid dysfunction occurred in 19% of patients treated with CABOMETYX, including Grade 3 in 0.4% of patients. Patients should be assessed for signs of thyroid dysfunction prior to the initiation of CABOMETYX and monitored for signs and symptoms of thyroid dysfunction during CABOMETYX treatment. Thyroid function testing and management of dysfunction should be performed as clinically indicated. Hypocalcemia: CABOMETYX can cause hypocalcemia. Based on the safety population, hypocalcemia occurred in 13% of patients treated with CABOMETYX, including Grade 3 in 2% and Grade 4 in 1% of patients. Laboratory abnormality data were not collected in CABOSUN. In COSMIC-311, hypocalcemia occurred in 36% of patients treated with CABOMETYX, including Grade 3 in 6% and Grade 4 in 3% of patients. Monitor blood calcium levels and replace calcium as necessary during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue CABOMETYX depending on severity. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: CABOMETYX can cause fetal harm. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating CABOMETYX and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common (\u226520%) adverse reactions are: CABOMETYX as a single agent: diarrhea, fatigue, PPE, decreased appetite, hypertension, nausea, vomiting, weight decreased, and constipation. CABOMETYX in combination with nivolumab: diarrhea, fatigue, hepatotoxicity, PPE, stomatitis, rash, hypertension, hypothyroidism, musculoskeletal pain, decreased appetite, nausea, dysgeusia, abdominal pain, cough, and upper respiratory tract infection. DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: If coadministration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors cannot be avoided, reduce the CABOMETYX dosage. Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice. Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: If coadministration with strong CYP3A4 inducers cannot be avoided, increase the CABOMETYX dosage. Avoid St. John\u2019s wort. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise women not to breastfeed during CABOMETYX treatment and for 4 months after the final dose.

At an interim analysis, the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA-based regimen demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS), one of the study\u2019s dual primary endpoints, and objective response rate (ORR), a key secondary endpoint, compared to standard of care chemotherapy. The study continued, and at the final analysis, it did not meet its other primary endpoint of overall survival (OS). The safety profile of the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA-based regimen was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies evaluating the combination. A full evaluation of the data from this study is ongoing, and Merck and Eisai will present these results at an upcoming medical meeting. \"Locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma remains a challenging disease to treat and a leading cause of cancer death worldwide,\" said Dr. Gregory Lubiniecki, Vice President, Global Clinical Development, Merck Research Laboratories. \"These study results add to our understanding of this combination and will inform our future research as we strive to improve outcomes for more patients with cancer.\" \"Gastric and gastroesophageal cancers continue to present challenges due to their heterogeneity and generally poor prognoses,\" said Dr. Corina Dutcus, Senior Vice President, Oncology Global Clinical Development Lead at Eisai Inc. \"While the LEAP-015 trial did not show a statistically significant increase in overall survival, we were pleased to observe an improvement in progression-free survival and objective response rate for patients treated with KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA in combination with chemotherapy. These results contribute to the scientific community\u2019s collective understanding of these complex diseases and add to the body of knowledge in oncology research. We are deeply grateful to the patients, caregivers and investigators who participated in this study.\" Weiterlesen KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA is approved in the U.S., the EU, Japan and other countries for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and certain types of advanced endometrial carcinoma. Lenvatinib is marketed as KISPLYX for advanced RCC in the EU. Merck and Eisai are studying the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination through the LEAP ( LE nvatinib A nd P embrolizumab) clinical program in hepatocellular carcinoma and esophageal cancer across multiple clinical trials. In gastric cancer, KEYTRUDA is approved in combination with fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adults with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-negative gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma based on OS and other data from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-859 trial. KEYTRUDA is also approved in combination with trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of adults with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma, whose tumors express PD-L1 (Combined Positive Score [CPS] \u22651) as determined by an FDA-approved test. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response data from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-811 trial. Continued approval of this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In esophageal cancer, KEYTRUDA is approved in combination with platinum- and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic esophageal or GEJ (tumors with epicenter 1 to 5 centimeters above the GEJ) carcinoma that is not amenable to surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation. This approval is based on OS and other data from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-590 trial. Results from the LEAP-015 trial do not affect the current approved indications for KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA or other ongoing trials from the LEAP clinical program. About LEAP-015 LEAP-015 is a randomized, open-label, Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04662710 ) evaluating KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA in combination with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-negative gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. There are two parts of the study: a safety run-in (Part 1) and the main study (Part 2). In Part 2, the primary endpoints are OS and PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 (Combined Positive Score [CPS] \u22651) and in all patients. Secondary endpoints are ORR and duration of response (DOR) as assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1 in both patients whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS \u22651) as well as in all patients, and safety. In Part 2, up to 880 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive: KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA plus chemotherapy: Induction Phase: approximately 12 weeks KEYTRUDA 400 mg intravenously (IV) every six weeks (Q6W) x 2 cycles plus oral LENVIMA 8 mg every day (QD) plus chemotherapy (CAPOX or mFOLFOX6) CAPOX: oral capecitabine 1000 mg/m 2 twice daily (BID) for 14 days plus oxaliplatin 130 mg/m 2 IV, every 3 weeks (Q3W) x 4 cycles or mFOLFOX6: bolus IV 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 400 mg/m 2 , plus 5-FU 2400 mg/m 2 continuous IV plus leucovorin 400 mg/m 2 IV or levoleucovorin 200 mg/m 2 IV plus oxaliplatin 85 mg/m 2 IV, every 2 weeks (Q2W) x 6 cycles Consolidation Phase: KEYTRUDA 400 mg IV Q6W, for less than or equal to 16 doses, plus oral LENVIMA 20 mg QD; or Chemotherapy (either CAPOX regimen or mFOLFOX6 regimen, dosed as above; maximum cycles per local standards). About gastric cancer Gastric (stomach) cancer tends to develop slowly over many years and rarely causes early symptoms, resulting in most cases going undetected until an advanced stage. More than 70% of patients with gastric cancer develop advanced-stage disease. Most gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas (about 90% to 95%), which develop from cells in the innermost lining of the stomach (known as the mucosa). Gastric cancer is the fifth most diagnosed cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with approximately 969,000 patients diagnosed and 660,000 deaths from the disease globally in 2022. In the U.S., it is estimated there will be approximately 26,890 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer and 10,880 deaths from the disease in 2024. The five-year relative survival rate for patients diagnosed with gastric cancer at a distant stage is 7% in the U.S. About esophageal cancer Esophageal cancer is the 11th most commonly diagnosed cancer and the seventh leading cause of death from cancer worldwide. It is estimated there were 511,000 new cases of esophageal cancer diagnosed and about 445,000 deaths resulting from the disease worldwide in 2022. In the U.S., it is estimated there will be approximately 22,370 patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer and 16,130 deaths from the disease in 2024. The five-year relative survival rate for patients diagnosed with advanced esophageal cancer is 6% in the U.S. Cancers that start in gland cells (cells that make mucus) are called adenocarcinomas and are often found in the lower third of the esophagus (lower thoracic esophagus). Adenocarcinoma is the most common form of esophageal cancer in the U.S. and its incidence is rapidly increasing in other parts of the world. About KEYTRUDA \u00ae (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mg KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body\u2019s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Merck has the industry\u2019s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers. Selected KEYTRUDA \u00ae (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S. Gastric Cancer KEYTRUDA, in combination with trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adults with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS \u22651) as determined by an FDA-approved test. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval of this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. KEYTRUDA, in combination with fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adults with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-negative gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. Esophageal Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic esophageal or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) (tumors with epicenter 1 to 5 centimeters above the GEJ) carcinoma that is not amenable to surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation either: in combination with platinum- and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, or as a single agent after one or more prior lines of systemic therapy for patients with tumors of squamous cell histology that express PD-L1 (CPS \u226510) as determined by an FDA-approved test. See additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information. Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients. Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution. Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution. Immune-Mediated Colitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients. Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis KEYTRUDA as a Single Agent KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients. KEYTRUDA With Axitinib KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT \u22653 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT \u22653 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT \u22653 ULN subsequently recovered from the event. Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies Adrenal Insufficiency KEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypophysitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects.

All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients. Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse Reactions KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti\u2013 PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients. These reactions led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% (2) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients. Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of <1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection. Infusion-Related Reactions KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT. Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials. Embryofetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

Please see Prescribing Information for KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) at http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/k/keytruda/keytruda_pi.pdf and Medication Guide for KEYTRUDA at http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/k/keytruda/keytruda_mg.pdf . About LENVIMA \u00ae (lenvatinib); available as 10 mg and 4 mg capsules LENVIMA, discovered and developed by Eisai, is an orally available multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4). LENVIMA inhibits other kinases that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1-4, the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA), KIT, and RET. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, LENVIMA decreased tumor-associated macrophages, increased activated cytotoxic T cells, and demonstrated greater antitumor activity in combination with an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody compared to either treatment alone. LENVIMA \u00ae (lenvatinib) Indications in the U.S. For the treatment of adult patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) In combination with pembrolizumab, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) In combination with everolimus, for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following one prior anti-angiogenic therapy For the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) In combination with pembrolizumab, for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma (EC) that is mismatch repair proficient (pMMR), as determined by an FDA-approved test, or not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H), who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation Selected Safety Information for LENVIMA Warnings and Precautions Hypertension. In differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), hypertension occurred in 73% of patients on LENVIMA (44% grade 3-4). In advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), hypertension occurred in 42% of patients on LENVIMA + everolimus (13% grade 3). Systolic blood pressure \u2265160 mmHg occurred in 29% of patients, and 21% had diastolic blood pressure \u2265100 mmHg. In unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), hypertension occurred in 45% of LENVIMA-treated patients (24% grade 3). Grade 4 hypertension was not reported in HCC. Serious complications of poorly controlled hypertension have been reported. Control blood pressure prior to initiation. Monitor blood pressure after 1 week, then every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, and then at least monthly thereafter during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose when hypertension is controlled or permanently discontinue based on severity. Cardiac Dysfunction. Serious and fatal cardiac dysfunction can occur with LENVIMA. Across clinical trials in 799 patients with DTC, RCC, and HCC, grade 3 or higher cardiac dysfunction occurred in 3% of LENVIMA-treated patients. Monitor for clinical symptoms or signs of cardiac dysfunction. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity. Arterial Thromboembolic Events. Among patients receiving LENVIMA or LENVIMA + everolimus, arterial thromboembolic events of any severity occurred in 2% of patients in RCC and HCC and 5% in DTC. Grade 3-5 arterial thromboembolic events ranged from 2% to 3% across all clinical trials. Among patients receiving LENVIMA with KEYTRUDA, arterial thrombotic events of any severity occurred in 5% of patients in CLEAR, including myocardial infarction (3.4%) and cerebrovascular accident (2.3%). Permanently discontinue following an arterial thrombotic event. The safety of resuming after an arterial thromboembolic event has not been established and LENVIMA has not been studied in patients who have had an arterial thromboembolic event within the previous 6 months. Hepatotoxicity. Across clinical studies enrolling 1,327 LENVIMA-treated patients with malignancies other than HCC, serious hepatic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% of patients. Fatal events, including hepatic failure, acute hepatitis and hepatorenal syndrome, occurred in 0.5% of patients. In HCC, hepatic encephalopathy occurred in 8% of LENVIMA-treated patients (5% grade 3-5). Grade 3-5 hepatic failure occurred in 3% of LENVIMA-treated patients. 2% of patients discontinued LENVIMA due to hepatic encephalopathy and 1% discontinued due to hepatic failure.

If urine dipstick proteinuria \u22652+ is detected, obtain a 24-hour urine protein. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity. Diarrhea. Of the 737 LENVIMA-treated patients in DTC and HCC, diarrhea occurred in 49% (6% grade 3). In RCC, diarrhea occurred in 81% of LENVIMA + everolimus\u2013treated patients (19% grade 3). Diarrhea was the most frequent cause of dose interruption/reduction, and diarrhea recurred despite dose reduction. Promptly initiate management of diarrhea. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity. Fistula Formation and Gastrointestinal Perforation. Of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA or LENVIMA + everolimus in DTC, RCC, and HCC, fistula or gastrointestinal perforation occurred in 2%.

In HCC, QTc interval increases of >60 ms occurred in 8% of LENVIMA-treated patients and QTc interval >500 ms occurred in 2%. Monitor and correct electrolyte abnormalities at baseline and periodically during treatment. Monitor electrocardiograms in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or those who are taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery based on severity. Hypocalcemia. In DTC, grade 3-4 hypocalcemia occurred in 9% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In 65% of cases, hypocalcemia improved or resolved following calcium supplementation with or without dose interruption or dose reduction. In RCC, grade 3-4 hypocalcemia occurred in 6% of LENVIMA + everolimus\u2013treated patients. In HCC, grade 3 hypocalcemia occurred in 0.8% of LENVIMA-treated patients. Monitor blood calcium levels at least monthly and replace calcium as necessary during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity. Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS). Across clinical studies of 1,823 patients who received LENVIMA as a single agent, RPLS occurred in 0.3%. Confirm diagnosis of RPLS with MRI. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity and persistence of neurologic symptoms. Hemorrhagic Events. Serious including fatal hemorrhagic events can occur with LENVIMA. In DTC, RCC, and HCC clinical trials, hemorrhagic events, of any grade, occurred in 29% of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA as a single agent or in combination with everolimus. The most frequently reported hemorrhagic events (all grades and occurring in at least 5% of patients) were epistaxis and hematuria. In DTC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 2% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 1 fatal intracranial hemorrhage among 16 patients who received LENVIMA and had CNS metastases at baseline. In RCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 8% of LENVIMA + everolimus\u2013treated patients, including 1 fatal cerebral hemorrhage. In HCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 5% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 7 fatal hemorrhagic events. Serious tumor-related bleeds, including fatal hemorrhagic events, occurred in LENVIMA-treated patients in clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting. In postmarketing surveillance, serious and fatal carotid artery hemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than other tumors. Safety and effectiveness of LENVIMA in patients with ATC have not been demonstrated in clinical trials. Consider the risk of severe or fatal hemorrhage associated with tumor invasion or infiltration of major blood vessels (eg, carotid artery). Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity. Impairment of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Suppression/Thyroid Dysfunction. LENVIMA impairs exogenous thyroid suppression. In DTC, 88% of patients had baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level \u22640.5 mU/L. In patients with normal TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH level >0.5 mU/L was observed post baseline in 57% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In RCC and HCC, grade 1 or 2 hypothyroidism occurred in 24% of LENVIMA + everolimus\u2013treated patients and 21% of LENVIMA-treated patients, respectively. In patients with normal or low TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH was observed post baseline in 70% of LENVIMA-treated patients in HCC and 60% of LENVIMA + everolimus\u2013treated patients in RCC. Monitor thyroid function prior to initiation and at least monthly during treatment. Treat hypothyroidism according to standard medical practice. Impaired Wound Healing. Impaired wound healing has been reported in patients who received LENVIMA. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of LENVIMA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ). ONJ has been reported in patients receiving LENVIMA. Concomitant exposure to other risk factors, such as bisphosphonates, denosumab, dental disease or invasive dental procedures, may increase the risk of ONJ. Perform an oral examination prior to treatment with LENVIMA and periodically during LENVIMA treatment. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices and to consider having preventive dentistry performed prior to treatment with LENVIMA and throughout treatment with LENVIMA. Avoid invasive dental procedures, if possible, while on LENVIMA treatment, particularly in patients at higher risk. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk of ONJ. Withhold LENVIMA if ONJ develops and restart based on clinical judgement of adequate resolution. Embryo\u2010Fetal Toxicity. Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of LENVIMA during organogenesis at doses below the recommended clinical doses resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus; and advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for 30 days after the last dose.

These data are being presented at the 2025 ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium taking place January 23-25, 2025, in San Francisco, California. These data showed an overall response rate of 38% compared to initially announced 27% 1 , and complete responses (CR) per RECIST v1.1 increased to 17.2% compared to previously announced 10.3% 2 and initial assessment of 0% 1 , demonstrating both an increase in ORR and a deepening of responses compared to previous datasets.\u00a0Importantly, responses were seen in viral and nonviral disease, and toxicity was consistent with the known safety profiles of atezolizumab and bevacizumab, with no new safety signals identified. These data support continued evaluation of casdozo with other therapies, including a trial of casdozo/toripalimab (tori)/bev in HCC, which Coherus has now opened for enrollment. Casdozo is a first-in-class antibody, and the only clinical-stage immunomodulatory cytokine antagonist targeting IL-27, an immunoregulatory cytokine involved in suppressing anti-tumor immune responses and an important new target for cancer treatment. \u201cThe casdozo data in HCC demonstrate translation of the preclinical data in liver cancer to first-line HCC cancer patients with efficacy and a favorable safety profile. These data support the ongoing development of IL-27 as a promising novel target for advanced solid tumors,\u201d said Rosh Dias, M.D., Coherus\u2019 Chief Medical Officer. \u201cWe recently opened enrollment for our randomized, controlled, multinational Phase 2 trial of casdozo in combination with toripalimab, our anti-PD-1 antibody, plus bev. The combination of tori plus bev has demonstrated promising Phase 3 results in HCC 3 , and we believe the addition of casdozo may further enhance anti-tumor effects and advance our next-generation immuno-oncology combinations focused on overcoming immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment.\u201d Story Continues \u201cThe treatment landscape for liver cancer, particularly for patients who are not eligible for surgery or who are metastatic, has improved in recent years thanks to immunotherapy combinations. However, there is still a clear unmet need for novel treatment options that can further improve survival without added toxicity,\u201d said Daneng Li, M.D., Associate Professor in the Department of Medical Oncology & Therapeutics Research and Co-Director, Liver Cancer Collaborative Program, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center. \u201cThese final casdozo data continue to be encouraging and compare very favorably in the current treatment landscape, and speak to the potential for its novel anti-IL-27 mechanism to address these substantial unmet needs.\u201d Results from Phase 2 trial evaluating casdozo/atezo/bev combination in HCC This open-label Phase 2 clinical trial evaluated casdozo in combination with atezo and bev in 30 treatment-na\u00efve patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HCC. Patients received casdozokitug 10 mg/kg IV q3w in combination with atezolizumab (1200 mg) and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg). The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability. Key secondary endpoints included PFS and ORR based on investigator review per RECIST v1.1 (primary) and mRECIST (secondary), as well as disease control rate (DCR). As of the data cutoff date of September 4, 2024: Triplet blockade of the IL-27, PD-(L)1 and VEGF inhibitors with casdozo/atezo/bev demonstrated an acceptable safety profile with promising antitumor activity in immunotherapy na\u00efve HCC. Triplet combination treatment was well tolerated with a side effect profile consistent with known adverse event (AE) profiles of atezo/bev. Encouraging early activity with casdozo/atezo/bev: RECIST v1.1: ORR of 38% (n=29) with 11 objective responses, including 5 complete responses and 6 confirmed partial responses; median progression-free survival (PFS) of 8.1 months and disease control rate of 58.6%. mRECIST: ORR of 43% (n=28) with 12 objective responses, including 5 complete responses and 7 confirmed partial responses; median PFS of 8.4 months and disease control rate of 60.7%. Biomarker data show peripheral inhibition of IL-27 signaling and immune activation in NK and T cells following treatment, consistent with the casdozo preclinical data and mechanism of action. These results support continued evaluation of casdozo with VEGF and PD-(L)1 blockade in HCC. Recent Launch of New Phase 2 trial evaluating casdozo in combination with bev and toripalimab Coherus has initiated a new randomized Phase 2 study ( NCT06679985 ) evaluating casdozo, in combination with bev and tori, Coherus\u2019 next-generation anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, in participants with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HCC. This randomized, parallel, open-label Phase 2 study is designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and Project Optimus 4 dosing of the triplet combination. The study is expected to enroll up to 72 patients, who will be randomized to receive one of two biologically active doses of casdozo with tori plus bev or tori plus bev without casdozo. ASCO-GI 2025 Presentation Details Title: Results from a phase 2 study of triplet blockade of the IL-27, PD-(L)1, and VEGF pathways with casdozokitug (casdozo, CHS-388) in combination with atezolizumab and bevacizumab in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) Lead Author: Daneng Li, City of Hope National Comprehensive Cancer Center Abstract 605 : Poster Board #D6 Poster Session B: Cancers of the Pancreas, Small Bowel, and Hepatobiliary Tract Date and Time: Friday, January 24, 2025; 11:30am \u2013 1:00pm PT About Hepatocellular Carcinoma Hepatobiliary cancers include a spectrum of invasive carcinomas arising in the liver (hepatocellular carcinoma; HCC), gall bladder, and bile ducts (collectively called biliary tract cancers). The most common type of primary liver cancer in adults is HCC (accounting for ~90%), which is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. According to the NCI Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program (SEER), there will be an estimated 41,630 new cases and 29,840 deaths from liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancer in the US in 2024. 5 The U.S. 5-year relative survival rate for liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancer is 21.7%. 5 The liver cancer treatment pattern has changed in recent years with the emergence of immunotherapy combinations and will continue to evolve as more treatment options become available for these highly lethal cancers. About Casdozokitug Casdozokitug is a first-in-class human anti-IL-27 antibody designed to inhibit the activity of this immunosuppressive cytokine. Particular tumor types have been identified where IL-27 appears to play an important role in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and may contribute to resistance to treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. Blocking IL-27 with casdozokitug in clinical trials has led to monotherapy tumor growth inhibition and partial responses in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (NCT04374877). An ongoing trial is studying combinations with PD-(L)1 pathway blockade in NSCLC, and a planned clinical trial will study the triplet combination of IL-27, PD-(L)1, and VEGF pathway blockade in HCC. Casdozokitug has been granted Orphan Drug designation and Fast Track designation for the treatment of refractory hepatocellular carcinoma from the FDA. It is the first IL-27 antibody to enter the clinic. About\u00a0Coherus BioSciences Coherus is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research, development and commercialization of innovative immunotherapies to treat cancer.
