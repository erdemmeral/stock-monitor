[{"text": "Duolingo, Inc. (DUOL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It Zacks Equity Research Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 5:00 PM 5 min read In This Article: DUOL +0.12% Duolingo, Inc. (DUOL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term. Over the past month, shares of this company have returned -1.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Technology Services industry, which Duolingo falls in, has lost 3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction? While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Revisions to Earnings Estimates Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, Duolingo is expected to post earnings of $0.50 per share, indicating a change of +92.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days. The consensus earnings estimate of $2.03 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +480%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.05 indicates a change of +50.2% from what Duolingo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Duolingo. Story Continues The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: 12 Month EPS Projected Revenue Growth While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth. In the case of Duolingo, the consensus sales estimate of $204.66 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +35.5%. The $743.15 million and $963.15 million estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +39.9% and +29.6%, respectively. Last Reported Results and Surprise History Duolingo reported revenues of $192.59 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +39.9%. EPS of $0.49 for the same period compares with $0.06 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $188.67 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.08%. The EPS surprise was +36.11%. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period. Valuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance. While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price. The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Duolingo is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. Bottom Line The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Duolingo. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Street's top analyst calls The Fly Fri, Jan 24, 2025, 5:33 PM 4 min read In This Article: NFLX +0.22% Netflix upgraded, downgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly. Top 5 Upgrades: Bernstein upgraded Netflix (NFLX) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $1,200, up from $975. The firm believes another year of double-digit subscriber growth is achievable in 2025, driven by international markets. Baird upgraded Twilio (TWLO) to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $160, up from $115, following the investor day and pre-released Q4 upside. The firm came away more confident in the company's ability to continue to drive double-digit revenue growth and further upside to guidance and estimates. Piper Sandler upgraded Travelers (TRV) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $310, up from $259. The firm increased earnings estimates following the Q4 report and now thinks the stock is inexpensive. Guggenheim upgraded Restaurant Brands (QSR) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $71, down from $74. Restaurant Brands shares have slid 19% in the past year, while the S&P 500 rose 26%, notes the firm, which thinks Chairman Patrick Doyle has been \"making the right strategic improvements to the business and the stock is being valued as if it will not grow.\" Barclays upgraded Interpublic Group (IPG) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $36, up from $32. The acquisition by Omnicom (OMC) is likely to go through and Interpublic's valuation implies decent upside to the implied merger price, the firm tells investors in a research note. Top 5 Downgrades: Phillip Securities downgraded Netflix to Reduce from Neutral with a price target of $870, up from $695. The firm cites valuation for the downgrade following the recent share price strength. Stephens downgraded AutoNation (AN) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $192, down from $200. The firm notes the stock price has appreciated by about 16%; its 2025 EBITDA and EPS estimates are slightly lower; it now estimates that the 2025 ending share count will be about 2% higher; and it lowered its valuation multiple to reflect what it believes is slightly less EBITDA growth potential and a slight recalibration to its \"AN share buyback\" narrative. Guggenheim downgraded GE Vernova (GEV) to Neutral from Buy and removed the firm's prior $380 price target. The revised rating reflects not only the stock's strong recent performance, but also the firm's belief that the pace of upward revisions in GE Vernova's financial model is likely to slow, which makes additional upside to valuation based on EBITDA and free cash flow \"less likely.\" KeyBanc downgraded Brinker (EAT) to Sector Weight from Overweight without a price target. The firm cites valuation for the downgrade with the shares up over 200% in the past nine months. Raymond James downgraded CBRE Group (CBRE) to Outperform from Strong Buy with a price target of $152, down from $155. The firm cites valuation for the downgrade, as the stock now trades at a nearly six-turn premium relative to JLL (JLL) , which compares to its three-year average premium of four-turns. Story Continues Top 5 Initiations: Oppenheimer initiated coverage of Toast (TOST) with an Outperform rating and $46 price target. The firm believes the company's cloud-based platform should drive continued market share gains through capturing the restaurant industry's ongoing shift to omni-channel, integrated software. Citi reinstated coverage of Albertsons (ACI) with a Buy rating and $26 price target following a period of restriction. Though the company has lost some market share in the past several years and the environment remains challenging, the stock's risk/reward is favorable given the current valuation and the potential sales and profitability upside from self-help initiatives that management can now pursue following the blocked merger, the firm says. BofA initiated coverage of Quanta Services (PWR) with a Buy rating and $407 price target. Quanta, as the \"leading\" North American utility infrastructure services company, is positioned for growth as aging infrastructure and demand growth drive reinvestment. Jefferies initiated coverage of Duolingo (DUOL) with a Hold rating and $370 price target. The firm believes Duolingo's track record of \"attractive growth\" and upside to consensus justifies a premium multiple, but slowing payer growth among casual learners makes the bull case increasingly reliant on expansion into intermediate learners, which could prove challenging. Citi initiated coverage of DigitalOcean (DOCN) with a Buy rating and $45 price target. The firm says that while the company's new leadership lacks extensive public company tenure, the \"early fruits\" from their strategic initiatives suggest the team \"holds the right tools to differentiate\" DigitalOcean in the fragmented cloud infrastructure space and deliver sustainable sales growth.

This week's Motley Fool Money radio show starts now. This is the Motley Fool Money radio show. I'm Dylan Lewis. Joining me over the airwaves Motley Fool Senior Analyst Bill Mann and Matt Argersinger. Fools, great to have you both here. Matt Argersinger: Dylan. Bill Mann: Hey, Dylan, how are you doing, man? Dylan Lewis: I'm doing a bit better than the execs at ByteDance today. I think safe to say. As we tape, we are here on Friday around lunch, the fate of social media darling TikTok hangs in the balance. Bill, we are nearing the January 19th deadline where federal law will effectively ban the app. Friday morning, the Supreme Court upheld that law, which means that ByteDance will either need to divest the business to an American owner or lose access to a lot of users in the United States. Story Continues Bill Mann: So you're telling me they've got about 48 hours to sell something worth many billions of dollars? Dylan Lewis: It shouldn't be too hard, right? Bill Mann: Just throw it up on eBay and see what happens. [laughs] or Craigslist, even better. They can multi-list and then see where they get the best bid. It went to the Supreme Court because TikTok argued that their First Amendment rights were being violated, but Congress has determined that TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with China represented a security risk, and they had national security concerns, which is one of the areas upon which you can overturn or override the First Amendment. Once this ban goes into effect, TikTok is going to be unavailable to be downloaded or updated on any US devices. It's possible TikTok will be available for a while. But the next time TikTok goes to update it, it's going to become functionally unusable. Dylan Lewis: What I think is interesting with how they've set up that law is it's not just something that will affect ByteDance. The way that the law is structured, anybody enabling downloads, providing distribution to the app, etc, will be in violation of this law. This isn't just something that affects ByteDance. This is also something that affects Apple and Google to the tune of a $5,000 fine per user Bill. Are they going to be willing to stomach that? Bill Mann: Well, there's 170 million monthly American users on the platform. It's a little bit like the laws that make bars liable for serving alcohol to minors. It's the same exact concept. There's the user, but you're not necessarily at risk for those laws, but then there are the enablers and for them, this becomes a risk that maybe not for a Google or for an Apple, would put the entire company at risk, but 170 million times 5 turns into a lot of money really quickly. Matt Argersinger: If they do follow through, in other words, if Apple and Google really follow through on restricting the app, what's fascinating to me is, I think we're going to see firsthand how sustainable TikTok's network effect is. Because if suddenly the majority of US users, they go to YouTube, Instagram, most of them are already on those anyway, but they start using them a lot more. It's like David Gardner's snap test to me. If I snap my finger and on Sunday evening, TikTok is no longer available. Am I good? Does my life go on? Or is this something that is really going to be painful for all these US users? Dylan Lewis: This does feel a little bit like the federal budget. Probably something that is going to come right down to the wire or maybe have a kick the can type short term resolution. It's possible that between taping this and that deadline, there's something that moves this story along. We talked a little bit about that 170 million user count to paint a picture of the scope and importance of TikTok, because if it winds up being unavailable in the United States Bill, it leaves a tremendous vacuum in the social media landscape for other people and other time attention eyeballs to go into. Bill Mann: There's obviously hope that they will migrate to reels. A lot of American TikTokers have been going to another Chinese app called Red Note, which Red Note, in the Chinese name means Little Red Book or the book that Mao puts all of his thoughts in. Matt Argersinger: That won't be banned, ever. Bill Mann: Not exactly. [laughs] You can imagine just how excited the Chinese are for a whole lot of interaction between their mostly Chinese user base and the chaotic Americans who are on TikTok. There actually is another little thing that's going on here. I don't know if you guys know this, but we were going to be inaugurating a new president on Monday, and President Trump has had an entirely different opinion about what it is that we should do with ByteDance/TikTok than the current administration. Dylan Lewis: I believe the Biden administration has effectively said, we will leave that for you to decide and said, you know what? This is mostly happening during your administration, it is your decision. We've speculated a little bit. I'm going to invite a little bit more speculation. First up, will TikTok be forced into a sale? If so, Matt, who do you see as a potential buyer for TikTok? Matt Argersinger: I think it almost has to. I agree with Bill. this thing is going to get banned. I think the fines are just too much, even for Apple or Google. I think as sale is coming. I know we've seen rumors about Elon Musk. Not having read more into it, I feel like he must be the leading person, which is, as a person who's very attached to the Trump administration, I guess that makes sense. Dylan Lewis: Bill, do you see an X-TikTok conglomerate like that? Bill Mann: I do. The former Dodgers owner Frank McCourt has a proposal out there to buy it. Oddly enough, another person who's putting together an investing group is the former treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin, and under the First Trump administration, that was the first time that TikTok entered the radar, you know, for the US government as being something that maybe they needed to take a look at for national security concerns. But I do think that the answer at the end of the day has to be someone like Elon Musk or X or Google to take it over. Dylan Lewis: I want to follow up on that. What would a stand-alone version of the US business for TikTok be worth? Because there's a very large user base, but also how do you split out TikTok just in the United States? It's not a sandwich. You can't cut it in half. They have an algorithm. They have all this underlying tech. Bill, what would the price tag be for something like this? Bill Mann: It depends on what you're buying. I hate it depends answers, but it really does come down to this. TikTok has 1.6 billion monthly users, and we can see from the success of a platform, like Reddit since it's become public. If you've got a bunch of users like that, that's a huge value. That's a huge part of the battle. But the magic of TikTok is that algorithm, and I don't think that ByteDance would sell it. Even if they were willing to sell it, I don't think Beijing would let them. Even if they did, I'm not sure that the US government would allow us to even take on the algorithm because we don't know how it would be used. It really depends. If you are just talking about the user base, I see estimates of about $50 billion, which is a huge company. If they could extract the algorithm, though, this is going to be worth probably half of what a YouTube is worth, so 175-$200 billion. Dylan Lewis: The TikTok story, not the only one on Apple's radar this week, reports out that the company has lost its mantle as the top selling smartphone in China. Matt, this is a market that a lot of people have looked for growth for the company for a long time. What do you make of them slipping behind Huawei and Vivo? Matt Argersinger: Not a great week for the world's largest company. Slipping market share in China now behind the other two players. You had holidays on Monday, if you go back earlier in the week, iPhone sales in the holiday fourth quarter dropped 5%. You mentioned the Chinese smartphone makers, they now account for 56% of global smartphone shipments, which I was surprised to see how dominant those Chinese smartphone makers have become. Then you do have this quote, which hits Apple pretty hard, if you ask me. This comes from smartphone supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. I hope I was saying that right. They said, there is no evidence of Apple Intelligence's ability to benefit hardware replacement cycles or Apple's service business. That to me, might be slightly the bigger story because we've heard about Apple Intelligence. It was rolled out on the iPhone 16 here in the US, not too long ago, but it has not been the draw that I think Apple was expecting it to be. It's not really enticing people to upgrade their phones, and replacement cycles have gotten longer. Anyway, so to me, it just says, 'Wow, here we go have Apple still trading at 30 times forward earnings.\" It's down 12% from its recent high, yet still trading at that pretty lofty valuation doesn't deserve to. Not so long ago, ten years ago, Apple traded for about 15 times earnings or less about the time Buffett started buying. And, of course, we know Buffett's been selling lately. I don't know. This isn't a great setup for Apple here in 2025. Bill Mann: There are two things to keep in mind, the first of which is Apple Intelligence, which is the company's AI offering, has not been made available on its Chinese smartphones. The other thing, on the one hand, hearing that it's in third place in China, that's rough. But in actuality, it's only 15% of the overall market in China, and their shipments dropped 17% in 2024 versus 2023. They really do have some concerns about losing market share in China. Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break. We've got banks, banks, and more banks. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to the Motley Fool Money Radio show. I'm Dylan Lewis here on air with Bill Mann and Matt Argersinger. 2025 is off to a great start if you are in the business of money. We have earnings out from JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Wells, Citi, Bank of America . If it's a bank, it probably reported in the past week. Matt, we saw strength across most divisions. Didn't seem to matter. Commercial investment banking, pretty much everybody. Matt Argersinger: It was great all around, Dylan. Before we get into those results a little bit, I just want to step back really quickly and review 2024, because I'm not sure many investors or many of our listeners realize that financials was one of the top sectors in the S&P 500 last year. In fact, they were up 30% trailing just technology and communication services. They also offered investors one of the best shareholder yields in 2024, 3.7%, if you add together, dividends and shared purchase. The fourth quarter results that have been coming in this week really back that up. If you start with JP Morgan, biggest bank, fourth quarter revenue there up 10%, non- interest revenue, Dylan, up 29%, led by asset management and investment banking. Goldman Sachs net revenue up 23%. Again, investment banking fees were big there, up 24%. Trading revenue, fixed income and equities up more than 30% year over year. If you go down to a more traditional bank like Wells Fargo, Revenue there was flat, but you had significantly lower non-interest expense, lower provisions for credit losses. Net income for Wells Fargo was actually up 47% year over year, very impressive. Even some regional bank results from Trust and Regions that reported on Friday were also very strong. A really strong year in 2024 for financials, really strong fourth quarter and a ton of momentum here starting in 2025. Dylan Lewis: When we see numbers come in from the banks, we get to peer inside the mind of Jamie Diamond, the world's leading banker. While the financial results were good, Diamond does continue to use his quarterly soapbox Bill to remind us of some of the things that are out there, some of the topics that popped up in his commentary, the macro picture, geopolitics, inflation, regulations. Which of those do you want to dive into? Bill Mann: I think the most important thing now, what Matt just described in some ways, is a product of a certain type of environment, which was that we saw a lot of volatility in a lot of markets. On the risk taking side of the business of banks, they do love a bit of volatility, which we haven't seen in the past. On regulatory side, going back to the financial crisis, and Jamie Diamond, who it needs to be said, is very close to the vest about his own political beliefs, like who he voted for, who he supports. He does not talk about that very much, and I think it's smart for him to do because he can come across as an honest broker, has said that there are regulations, particularly the ones on lending that really need to be looked at because they go so far beyond what would keep the US economy safe. He's mentioned the fact that it used to be that banks would lend out $100 based on every $100 that they have in deposits, and now it's about $65. He's like, it's not just that it's something that impacts the banks, it really impacts the overall economy if banks are so worried to lend up to their deposit base. Dylan Lewis: When we saw the results come in this week, strong, strong reactions from Goldman, Morgan Stanley. I think all the banks were really up. How much of the optimism that we're seeing here is processing these results? Matt, how much of it is looking at the reality of a Trump administration for the next four years, maybe a pickup in some activity that generates income like IPO activity and looking forward and saying, things look pretty rosy for this sector in 2025. Matt Argersinger: I think you're right. It is the going forward look at the market, Dylan. Because, Bill went into the deregulation possibilities under the New Trump administration. But what you said about IPOs, the deal pipeline, in general, could be huge for banks in 2025. In fact, Ted Pick, the CEO of Morgan Stanley said \"his bank's deal pipeline is the strongest it's been in 5-10 years, maybe even longer\". I feel like the funnel of business for banks, particularly the largest banks, as we know, is getting wider, and a new Trump administration can make it even wider if there's less regulation and less scrutiny on mergers and deal making. Dylan Lewis: More deal making music to our ears. We love talking about M&A activity. We love looking at new issuances and digging it into the prospectuses. That's going to be fun stuff for us to cover in 2025. Matt Argersinger: So do those investment bankers with all the fees they get from those activities. Bill Mann: That's right. Dylan Lewis: Bringing us home in the news round up this week, the FDA authorized ZYN's nicotine pouches for sale in the United States, ending a will they won't they saga and finding that the product benefits adults looking to quit cigarettes and use alternatives. Bill, this feels like a win for adults looking for smoking alternatives, but it also feels eerily similar to the JUUL saga that we've seen over in the vaping side of this market. Bill Mann: I've always been very confused about what the policy goal is. If it is to stop people from smoking, something like a JUUL or something like a ZYN seems like an obvious benefit. If it is to stop nicotine use, then obviously they're not. But so the FDA has come out and said, I actually more is the former than the latter. The release said that the ZYN pouches posed a lower risk of cancer and other serious health conditions as compared with cigarettes and other smoking devices as well as in relation to other smokeless tobacco products. So we have some clarity here, and I think it's good for consumers. It's also good for Philip Morris and other tobacco companies. Dylan Lewis: I was going to say we don't talk about Philip Morris a ton on the show. They are the owners of the US distribution rights to ZYN. Matt, it's a dividend stock, and it's had what looks like a pretty good last few years. It's beat the market on a total return basis. It's got that 4.5% dividend yield. Is this at all interesting to you? Matt Argersinger: It is interesting, and I'll be upfront and say, I own shares in Altria , which spun out Philip Morris International. It must have been 15 years or so now. These companies have been surprisingly resilient, and maybe that's not a good commentary on our healthcare situation in the US. But you've seen revenue flat line decline, but these companies have done such a good job of finding new markets like ZYN or returning capital shareholders via dividends, like you mentioned, Dylan. On a total return basis, you've actually gotten a pretty good return as a shareholder, even though the revenues have been roughly flat to down, as we know, and the market for cigarettes thankfully continues to decline pretty steadily year to year. Dylan Lewis: Matt, when you look at a business since you are a shareholder of Altria, there is a legacy business that is largely where a lot of the money comes from. Then there are these smaller alternative options that are encouraging, growing, and maybe meeting that next generation of user or that person that is trying to quit traditional cigarettes. How do you value the two segments there? Matt Argersinger: Well, I think you always hope that those niche add on investments are going to grow because, yes, they are less harmful. What you tend to see, though, is there are some big hit or misses in that. Altria had one pretty big one with JUUL, as we saw recently. Bill Mann: The primary difference between JUUL and ZYN at this point is that ZYN has not really been something that's been very popular with the youth, whereas with JUUL, one of the big issues is that they were doing things like having a cotton candy flavored and other things that specifically attracted the youth. Dylan Lewis: Bill, Matt, we're going to see you guys a little bit later in today's show. Up next, we've got what to expect in the stock market in 2025 and through 2045. With Motley Fool co-founder, David Gardner, that's next on Motley Fool Money. Stay right here. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. Now, where will the stock market be at the end of 2025? It's hard to say for anyone that isn't being paid to give a number, but Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner has a guess on whether we'll be in the black or in the red come the end of December. Small spoiler. It's the same guess that he has every year. Last week, David chatted with my colleague Ricky Mulvey about the annual market prediction game and how to keep short term noise out of the way of your long term returns this year. Ricky Mulvey: There is a favorite foolish tradition, which is ragging on market forecasts. I know this is one of your favorite topics. I got one from Goldman Sachs. David Gardner: Great. Ricky Mulvey: Big headline. The S&P 500 is expected to return 10% in 2025. There's some very smart bankers that will tell you exactly what they think the stock market will do this year, David, you've been doing this a long time. What do you expect the market to do in 2025? David Gardner: I think the market's going up this year, Ricky, and that's because I think the market's going up every year. My record as a market timer predicting one year ahead each year, somewhere around this time is enviable because I think most people are a coin flip, and I get it right two thirds of the time. That's because two thirds of the time the market rises. I think it's always worth expecting it to rise, but recognizing it may not. In fact, one year in three, the market loses value. The Goldman Sachs example you cited, they basically predicted what would be a traditional market year, about a 10% gain. Now, coming after two very good years in which the S&P 500 rose more than 20% back to back years, that's a little contrary. That's probably a little bit more bullish than a lot of forecasts. But I think the market's going up this year. I don't put a percentage on it because I don't really care that much. I don't like it when the market goes down. Who does? But I feel very confident that the real conversation is, of course, about the long term and be invested your whole life so that one year doesn't really matter much, but I think the market's going up this year. Ricky Mulvey: Good, I hope so too. I understand why the large banks like offering the, I'll call it the false certainty of very specific market predictions. It makes you feel more comfortable that the market is more certain than it actually is over the short term. Over the long term, it's been the greatest wealth generation machine ever for people that have stayed invested for decades. We see the large banks doing this offering one year market forecasts, but when you think about the foolish style of investing, why don't fools think in terms of those one year increments? David Gardner: It's because we don't have to, the beauty of being an individual investor, especially if you're self directed, if you're rolling up your sleeves and doing at least some of it yourself, is that you're in command. When you give your money away to somebody else to manage, they're in command. Of course, a lot of people make good decisions and they don't want to spend that much time, so they put it toward index funds, which the Motley Fools always favored, and index funds have very low costs, usually, and typically mimic the market's returns. That's a perfectly good approach. But even then, those funds rebalance on a regular basis. That means they can't allow any stock to become too big or too successful. If NVIDIA starts becoming a titan, they have to start selling NVIDIA and put it into things that are down in order to maintain the charter of the fund, which is to remain highly diversified. They're having to play a quarterly or one year a game. I think a great advantage to those who want to be self directed. I think a lot of them are listening to us right now are that you can actually make these decisions yourself. You can decide whether you want to cash in and increase your tax bill this year or not. When you're investing in managed mutual funds, you're handed a tax bill near the end of every year that you didn't have much control over, and the average managed mutual fund turns over 70-100% in a given year. Seven out of 10 positions in actively managed mutual fund are no longer the same by December 31 from the first day of that year. There's huge activity and turnover, and we benefit so much as fellow Fools from finding good stuff and sticking with it. I think we don't have to think in one year increments. It's fun to make predictions, and of course, they're quotable for Goldman Sachs and their Ilk this time of year. But I guess I would rhetorically ask, Ricky, where is the reporting at the end of that year on who said what? Who got it right and who got it wrong and what anybody's baseball stats card looks like for their annual market predictions. We seem enamored of making them at the start of the year, very few people are around at the end of the year, holding anyone accountable with any scorecard, which is why I spend so little time looking at that. Ricky Mulvey: You mentioned friction there and the lack of friction for selling and buying. The advantage of it being for the individual investor, where you don't have to pay a salesperson commissions for buying anything, but then you mentioned the amount of turnover going on in these actively managed mutual funds. It's never been easier to sell as well, is the flip side of it being much easier to buy. We ragged on the one year, but then what is your expectation? How about a forecast for 2044 or 2045, if we're not thinking in one year increments? What's your expectation for the stock market then 5, 10, even 20 years from now, for someone who is investing regularly? David Gardner: I'm pretty sure when I was asked this by somebody 20 years ago, I said about the same thing, and I hope it's about happened. Twenty years is a good amount of time, first of all, Ricky, because it's a fourth or fifth of a life. It's long enough to really not be able to visualize what the world's going to look like, but it's still short enough to be meaningful and worth talking about in a way that is rational. I would say rational expectations of a rational optimist over the next 20 years are that the stock market would return roughly 10% a year. Goldman Sachs' call for 2025. Two years in three, I think I've already given you this ratio, but it's really helpful to remember at all times, two years in three. Over those 20 years, the market will go up. One year in three, the market will go down. Something like 13, 14 of those 20 years, the market will go up. This year might be one of them, or we might be one of those six or seven that goes down over the next 20 years. One year and 10, I would say twice over the course of the next 20 years, there will be a horrifically bad bear market. Over the last 20 years, we can see it. We can see the great financial recession, 2008, 09. Then 2022 was absolutely brutal. For me, as a Motley Fool stock picker and Rule Breaker investor, I think I got cut in half in 2022. Others may have done better than I, but that's a really bad year. I think twice over the next 20 years, there's going to be a very bad stock market for reasons we can't quite predict. Those usually last 18 months or so, the average bear market, 6-18 months. They always go down faster than they go up. That's one of my watch words. I would say in conclusion, it'll be a great 20 years. You will be well rewarded to invest and invest regularly. I would say you're even more likely to outperform if you take my rule breaker approach to investing, which means you're holding for long periods of time, the best companies of our time. That's my thought about the next 20 years. Ricky Mulvey: David, if you're going to play this game, you have to be a long term optimist. Which can be exceptionally difficult. A few things to be pessimistic about crushing national debt. We got drones over New Jersey. We don't know what they're doing. There's plenty of geopolitical risk going on with a war between Russia and Ukraine. You don't know what China's going to do with Taiwan. There are things to be scared of and pessimistic about. What are the reasons then? Not just the past market returns, but why should someone listening to this be a long term optimist? David Gardner: History is on your side. Ricky Mulvey: Next question. David Gardner: Often, when I was talking to people last year and they were upset about the election and on either party, just the whole feeling. Dave Barry, the humorous Miami Herald columnist, always does a year end review, and hilariously, I recommend reading Dave Barry's column about 2024 and the craziness of the year we just lived through. But as we got near the end of last year, and it's true right here at the start of this year, you can call it every bad thing, some of which are serious and some of which drones, anyway, to me, not that serious. You can call it every bad thing, and yet I would ask you rhetorically, why is the stock market at all time highs? The reason is because the stock market is smarter than reacting to near term if it leads, it leads headlines. The stock market is reflecting the growth of business. American business is the best business in the world. American business has better products and services today than at any point in history. We often are in danger of taking things for granted, like how cheap it is to tap in over face time with a relative halfway around the world for free or to eat food that is far healthier or drive cars that are far less dangerous in every way to the environment and to humans than they were 25 years before. These things are constantly improving around us. AI is here to make things even better than that. I think it's very obvious if anybody takes a moment to look at the graph of the S&P 500, or Dow Jones, if you like, or the NASDAQ over any meaningful period, called the last 10 years, called the last 25 or 50, it goes lower left to upper right. Each of the really hard things that we lived through, which were really hard, 2008, '09 was really hard. Each of those things at backwards through a meaningful amount of time is a small blip on the graph. At the time you're living it, it doesn't feel good. But there are very rational repeatable reasons why things go lower left to upper right over the last 50 years and will over the next 50 years. That's really what has to be spoken to. I don't feel like I have to prove out why that is or that that is. Those are the facts. I think I would need to hear from somebody to explain to me why that won't continue to recur when I'm very confident that it will. I think Ricky, a lot of the Motley Fool has always started with people who are optimist. Our company has been built by optimists to most of the people who are staying with us 20 years later with their memberships and really grateful. Those are people who are optimistic. They recognize the goodness that's in the world. I think that's so important to call out at all times, maybe especially this year, I'm not sure. But the American economy, by the way, is such a wonderful. Warren Buffett never bet against America. He's right. Ricky Mulvey: Let's move on to a technology that's easy to be pessimistic about. I don't have to look far on the Internet to find long term pessimists about artificial intelligence. But whether it being the percentage of doom, people thinking that it will cause civilization collapse. Because of super intelligent robots coming to take us all. I know it's something James Cameron has been worried about for a number of decades since creating the terminator movie. But when you're looking at artificial intelligence through the lens of long term optimism, through the lens of rational optimism. Why is it something that you're hopeful about? David Gardner: Because it's going to make us smarter and it's going to improve so many things around us. Tied very closely to AI is, of course, robotics. Once you start putting AI into robots, you start seeing a much more automated world where a lot of the jobs that are lower quality jobs today that ideally humans could spend their minds and their potential on higher callings. I think a lot of those jobs are going to be taken over. The amount of automation that amazon.com uses today is remarkable and has been for quite a while. But you ain't seen nothing yet. I'm very confident that AI is obviously for real. One of my favorite lines from Stuart Brand, the longtime tech visionary, Stuart Brand said, when a new technology shows up, an important one, a big one, you're either part of the steamroller or part of the road. I think it's very much worth being part of the steamroller with AI. I appreciate caution and cautionary thinking. I think there has to be always a balance, but let's not make the mistake of doubting the Internet, doubting e commerce, which is what we faced as early stock pickers online with Fool.com. A lot of people didn't even believe in e-commerce. I remember being on CNN and championing the idea that people would give their credit cards over the Internet. At the time, that was questionable. That seemed a little crazy, will that person on Ebay actually send you the thing that you just bought from them online, whatever online means? These things we take for granted today, they've been such an enabler for our economy worldwide. That'll be the case for AI, as well. Yes, AI will be used for Ilk in the same way that the Internet has been used for Ilk. It's a powerful tool. But we're going to be part of the steam roller at the Motley Fool as well.

I'm Dylan Lewis, joined again by Bill Mann and Matt Argersinger, we are jumping right into stocks on our radar this week. As he does every week, our man behind the glass Rick Engdahl is going to hit you with a question after you pitch your stock. Matt, you're up first. What are you looking at this week? Matt Argersinger: Dylan, I'm going with Invitation Homes, Ticker INVH a real estate Investment Trust, I've mentioned a few times on this show. It owns single family rentals, and as the latest quarter, owned about 85,000 of them. It's one of the largest institutional owners of single family homes, and there's this weird disconnect right now, Dylan, and I can't explain. Credit to Anthony Shavon, who I work with in Dividend Investor. He's been on this for the better part two years, which is, if you take Invitations current enterprise value, which is its market cap plus its net debt and divide that by the number of homes in its portfolio, you arrive at an average home value of about 318,000. But if you look at the median US home price, that's closer to 400,000. In fact, if you look at the average sale price for homes in the markets where Invitation Homes operates, it's around 415,000. This is all, by the way, data from Green Street from a recent Wall Street Journal article. Either the average US home price is about 25% overvalued, or Invitation Homes share price is around 30% undervalued. I think something's got to give, and I don't think home prices in the US are going to drop 25% without some economic calamity. I'm going with Invitation Homes is really cheap. By the way, if you buy shares today, you get about a 3.8% dividend yield, almost three times the yield on the S&P 500 at the moment Rick. Dylan Lewis: That was a tight radar stock pitch there, Matt, and an arbitrage opportunity. Matt Argersinger: I think so. Dylan Lewis: Rick, a question about Invitation Homes, Ticker INVH. Rick Engdahl: Matt, I've listened to you about REITS before. I think Pebblebrook might be one that I bought not doing real well. I've had really bad luck with REITS. Can you promise me that this one's going to go up? Matt Argersinger: Yes. It will go up, Rick.. Rick Engdahl: On behalf of our lawyers, I like to hop in and say no. That cannot promise that will go up [inaudible] I promise. Dylan Lewis: Bill, what legally non binding radar stock do you have this week? Bill Mann: I have to get myself back together. I'm sorry. My company is actually a company that you probably wouldn't have thought to have benefited from the potential shutdown of TikTok, and that is Duolingo. Duolingo reported a 216% spike in US users learning Chinese as TikTok users in the US move over to the other Chinese platform, Red Note. The company also had its stock go up really substantially in the last week because they've opened up their AI powered video chat feature to Android, which opens them up to a lot of different markets. This is a subscription business. It trades at 21 times sales, which gives me the vapors. But I think that Duolingo has done an incredible job of being a default for casual language learners. Dylan Lewis: Rick, a question about Duolingo? Ticker DUOL. Rick Engdahl: My wife, my kids, they've been using Duolingo for a couple of years now. They love hitting their streaks. The gamification really works. Not one of them is speaking any Spanish, as far as I can tell. As our resident polyglot, does it work? Bill Mann: It actually does. My daughter has learned Mandarin and she's actually made it to the end of their offerings,. Rick Engdahl: They did make it to the end of the thing. They just don't learn the language [LAUGHTER] Bill Mann: Well, maybe they should not be studying Welsh, then their Spanish would be better. Rick Engdahl: Actually, my daughter is supposed to be studying Spanish for school. But she really wants to learn Swedish, so she keeps jumping between them. Dylan Lewis: It's the classic dilemma Spanish or Swedish Rick. I have a follow up question on Duolingo to Bill. I have some personal beef. That's where it comes from. I need to learn Tagalog. My fiancee's family is Filipino. It is the 25th most spoken language, according to Ethnologue. It is not supported by Duolingo. That seems like a missed opportunity to me. Bill Mann: Mabuhi I think part of it has to do with the fact that the Philippines, in particular, is one of those countries where if you show up and try and speak Tagalog, they just immediately say, I speak English. There are some definite gaps, and it is and it is definitely driven by demand, and the demand isn't there. But, Dylan, given your bully pulpit, I think you can make it happen. Dylan Lewis: Duolingo, I say, Hina ho for the Filipino listeners out there. Rick, which company's going on your watch list this week? Rick Engdahl: This is a tough one. Do I trust Matty? Do I go with what? Give you one more chance, Matt. One more chance. Invitation Homes it is. Matt Argersinger: I will not let you down, Rick. Dylan Lewis: Matt and Bill, appreciate you guys bringing in the radar socks. Rick, appreciate you weighing in.

Lawrence Nga, The Motley Fool Mon, Jan 20, 2025, 1:03 PM 5 min read In this article: DUOL +0.12% Duolingo 's (NASDAQ: DUOL) stock is on a winning streak, delivering market-beating returns to investors for two consecutive years. The education app's solid execution and prospects have captured investors' attention. This article will delve deeper into the company, highlighting some key aspects investors should know about this up-and-coming tech company. Image source: Getty Images. Bringing the best education to everyone, everywhere Duolingo is an excellent example of a noble vision enabled by the ongoing development of the technology industry. Founded by two engineers, Duolingo aims to democratize high-quality education, ensuring that everyone (regardless of their economic and cultural backgrounds) can conveniently access education to better their lives. Leveraging smartphones, the tech company developed a bite-sized, on-demand, and engaging app to help anyone learn new languages. Duolingo's focus on teaching languages has practical reasons. First and foremost, job seekers can earn higher salaries than their peers with average English ability by mastering specific languages like English. Beyond that, learning new languages can help build new experiences and human connections. For instance, an American-born Asian can communicate better with older family members back in his native country by picking up his native tongue. Besides making language learning easily accessible via smartphones, Duolingo offers its product free of charge, teaching 40 languages to 113 million monthly active users (MAU). The only cost to users is to watch an advertisement after the end of an exercise. Learners can also subscribe to premium services -- Super Duolingo and Duolingo Max -- to remove the ads and access premium features. Also, Duolingo ensures that the learning experience on its app is fun and engaging , more like a game than boring language classes, to motivate users to keep coming back for more. The tech company also leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to offer personalized learning experiences to deliver superior learning outcomes. Doing good is financially rewarding Unlike most companies, Duolingo did not start with a single-minded pursuit of profits but rather with the goal of making high-quality education accessible to everyone. Still, that did not stop the company from building a profitable business model around it. In the third quarter of 2024, Duolingo generated $193 million in revenue, $140 million in gross profit, and $56 million in operating cash flow. Of this revenue, 82% was from paid subscriptions, and the rest was from non-subscription revenue, such as advertising. Story continues Besides being profitable, Duolingo is also growing rapidly, with revenue increasing by 40% in the latest quarter due to a 45% jump in subscription bookings. In short, the tech company is a rare example of a high- growth company that's also enormously profitable. A sea of opportunity Duolingo's success could soon propel it to join the billion-dollar-revenue club of tech companies. Yet there's a good argument that the company has only scratched the surface of the tremendous opportunity ahead. To start, Duolingo has plenty of opportunities to grow its user base of 113 million, especially considering that the company's app is available almost anywhere globally. With the potential to reach billions of users, Duolingo's existing user base is just a drop in the ocean. Secondly, only 8.6 million of the 113 million users are paid subscribers. Even if Duolingo increases its paid user base by 10 times its current size, it will still have unconverted users. To this end, the tech company's ongoing product enhancement -- adding new subjects and features and improving engagement and learning outcomes -- will motivate users to pay for premium services. For instance, the company introduced the Video Call feature for its Duolingo Max, which allows users to practice conversation skills with Lily, an AI agent who remembers past interactions. This feature will help learners practice their conversational skills, which will likely improve the learning outcome. To put the opportunity into numbers, Duolingo estimated that the digital learning industry will hit $1 trillion in 2026, of which the online language industry could reach $47 billion by 2025. In short, there's a sea of opportunity ahead! What it means for investors With a combination of growth, profits, and untapped potential, Duolingo is a leading investment candidate, especially for investors seeking exposure to a high-growth, mission-driven company with strong financial fundamentals. The key is for the company to continue improving its product offerings and growing its user base in the coming years. If it can do so, it stands a good chance of expanding its market share in the booming edtech industry.

\u00b7 CFOTO\u2014Future Publishing via Getty Images) Stuart Dyos Sat, Jan 18, 2025, 5:04 PM 3 min read In This Article: DUOL +0.12% Duolingo shares have jumped this week, as the number of Americans learning Mandarin on the app has soared 216%. That's as China's RedNote is now the most downloaded free app on Apple's App Store ahead of the TikTok ban. Duolingo shares climbed 10% this week as Americans turn to Chinese-language social media app RedNote and rush to learn Mandarin ahead of TikTok's ban slated for Sunday. Duolingo told Fortune that Mandarin learners on the app have jumped 216% so far this year to 11.3 million. That\u2019s no accident as Duolingo is on the TikTok rival as well. \u201cOur marketing team is forward-thinking and already has a presence on Red,\u201d a Duolingo spokesperson told Fortune. Active since May of last year, Duolingo\u2019s RedNote account has more than 400,000 followers. By comparison, Spanish saw a 40% increase over the course of the same timeframe but remains the most popular language on Duolingo with 48.8 million learners, CNBC reported. On Friday, the Supreme Court upheld the U.S. law banning TikTok unless it\u2019s sold by its China-based parent company due to national security risks, related to the ByteDance's ties to the Chinese government. President Joe Biden has signaled he won't enforce the ban, and President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to find a way to save the app. But until there's a solution, third-party platforms may not want to risk violating the law by supporting TikTok, and ByteDance has threatened to shut it down. With just a few days left before the law goes into effect on Sunday, TikTok devotees are rushing to the next closest thing. Xiaohongshu, known in the U.S. as RedNote, holds the top spot as the most downloaded free application on Apple\u2019s app store. According to Sensor Tower, the platform has seen a 194% weekly jump in downloads and a\u00a0 200% year-over-year increase. A person close to the company told Reuters on Wednesday that in a two-day period, RedNote had more than 700,000 new users. But as former TikTok users post videos on the app that have gone viral with the term \u201cTikTok refugees,\u201d RedNote may be banned under the same law that is hitting TikTok. \u201cThis appears to be the kind of app that the statute would apply to and could face the same restrictions as TikTok if it's not divested,\u201d a U.S. official told CBS News . Signed April 2024 by Biden, the \u201cProtecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act\u201d allows the federal government to restrict use of foreign social media platforms. The law allows Congress to strip a platform\u2019s foreign ownership within its U.S. operations; it can also be nationally terminated if deemed as a threat. The law is applicable to platforms that allow collaborative content sharing with more than 1 million monthly users, the parent company is located in a foreign country, and the president deems the platform poses a threat to national security.

Why This Social App Has Knocked TikTok Down the Download Charts Sarina Trangle Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 11:59 PM 3 min read CFOTO / Future Publishing via Getty Images The logos of the RedNote and TikTok social media apps. Key Takeaways Millions of Americans downloaded Chinese social app Xiaohongshu, or RedNote, this week. Users are migrating to it and other apps as a potential shutdown of TikTok looms in the U.S. RedNote was the most downloaded free app among iPhone users in the U.S. as of Friday afternoon, as well as Android users. Social-media fortunes rose and fell on app stores this week. Millions of Americans downloaded the Chinese social networking app Xiaohongshu as a possible U.S. prohibition of TikTok loomed. By late Friday, the app also known as RedNote led the Apple ( AAPL ) App Store's list of top, free downloaded iPhone apps in the U.S. Other well-known social media apps, including Meta's ( META ) Facebook and TikTok, were bumped from the top five. RedNote also topped the free table in Alphabet's ( GOOGL ) Google Play store. The Supreme Court on Friday upheld a law requiring ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s parent company, to sell the platform or face a shutdown. Elected officials see the measure as a way to curtail national security risks presented by a Chinese-owned firm having data on the app's roughly 170 million American users. U.S. groups could be fined for providing services or support to TikTok as soon as Sunday. Enforcement, however, will likely fall to Donald Trump, who is slated to be sworn in as president on Monday. Trump on Friday said he has discussed TikTok with the Chinese President Xi Jinping, and needs time to review the situation. (If the ban holds, Morgan Stanley says, several U.S. companies could benefit .) 'Xiaohongshu' Is Having a Moment in the U.S. Meanwhile, many Americans flocked to Xiaohongshu, which loosely translates to \"Little Red Book\" or \u201cRedNote\u201d and has traditionally been marketed to Mandarin speakers. RedNote shows videos in an infinite scroll\u2014like TikTok does\u2014and has a dedicated shopping section. Although some of RedNote's navigation features are in English, other text remains in Mandarin. (The number of Americans learning Mandarin through DuoLingo ( DUOL ) has recently boomed, the app said on X this week.) RedNote didn't respond to Investopedia's request for comment. RedNote vaulted to the head of the Apple store's list of top free apps Monday, joining household names like Instagram, Threads, TikTok and Facebook, according to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. Millions joined RedNote during the five-day period ended Thursday, sending the app's U.S. download rate up to 10 times its recent average, Sensor Tower said. Other video apps, such as Flip and Clapper, along with Instagram also took off during the five-day period that ended on Thursday, Sensor Tower said, while Threads saw a slight decline in downloads. Story Continues The number of daily RedNote users in the U.S. hit 13.3 million\u2014nearly 15% of TikTok's domestic traffic\u2014on Monday, according to Similarweb, a web traffic analysis group. By Friday afternoon, TikTok, Facebook and Instagram were off the list of top five free iPhone apps in the U.S., according to Apple's store. RedNote remained the leader, and other video-centric apps had moved into the top five, including Lemon8 and Clapper. (Those last two apps were also just behind RedNote in the Android store.) Meanwhile, another app remained in the top 10 on both stores: TikTok.
