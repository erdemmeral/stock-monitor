32, on deadline for Lebanon withdrawal Kamal Mehanna, and Mahmoud Zayat in Houla Sun, Jan 26, 2025, 11:32 AM 4 min read An Israeli army tank on the outskirts of the border village of Mais al-Jabal in south Lebanon (-) Israeli troops fired at residents of south Lebanon on Sunday, killing two and wounding 32, health officials said, as hundreds of people tried to return to their homes on the deadline for Israeli forces to withdraw from the area. Israel was all but certain to miss Sunday's deadline, which is part of a ceasefire agreement that ended its war with the Iran-backed Hezbollah group two months ago. The deal that took effect on November 27 said the Lebanese army was to deploy alongside United Nations peacekeepers in the south as the Israeli army withdrew over a 60-day period. That period ends on Sunday. Lebanon's health ministry said Israeli forces had opened fire in at least two border towns on \"citizens who were trying to return to their villages\", killing two and wounding 32. The ministry had previously said the \"aggression\" had centred on the two villages of Houla and Kfar Kila. Earlier, Lebanon's official National News Agency had reported that Israeli fire wounded several people in Kfar Kila \"who crossed the barrier and checkpoint put in place by the occupation army\", referring to Israel. Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee issued a message earlier on Sunday to residents of more than 60 villages in southern Lebanon, including Kfar Kila and Houla, telling them not to return. AFP journalists said convoys of vehicles carrying hundreds of people were trying to return to several villages despite the military's continued presence. AFPTV live images from Kfar Kila showed crowds gathered, some with yellow Hezbollah flags, near Lebanese security vehicles that blocked a road near a petrol station. Beyond them sat another military vehicle on an empty stretch of the road. On Saturday, the Lebanese army said a delay in implementing the agreement was the \"result of the procrastination in the withdrawal from the Israeli enemy's side\". Israeli forces have left coastal areas of southern Lebanon, but are still present in areas further east. The ceasefire deal stipulates that Hezbollah pull back its forces north of the Litani River -- about 30 kilometres (20 miles) from the border -- and dismantle any remaining military infrastructure in the south. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said on Friday that \"the ceasefire agreement has not yet been fully enforced by the Lebanese state\", so the military's withdrawal would continue beyond the Sunday deadline. \"The withdrawal process is conditional upon the Lebanese army deploying in southern Lebanon and fully and effectively enforcing the agreement, with Hezbollah withdrawing beyond the Litani River,\" a statement from Netanyahu's office said. Story Continues It added that \"the gradual withdrawal process will continue in full coordination with the United States\", a key ally and one of the monitors of the ceasefire. The Lebanese army said it was \"ready to continue its deployment as soon as the Israeli enemy withdraws\". - 'Scorched earth' - Hezbollah lawmaker Ali Fayad said on Saturday that Israel's \"excuses\" were a pretext to \"pursue a scorched earth policy\" in border areas that would make the return of displaced residents impossible. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, who took office earlier this month, spoke on Saturday with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron, whose government is also involved in overseeing the truce. According to a statement from his office, Aoun spoke of the \"need to oblige Israel to respect the terms of the deal in order to maintain stability in the south\". Aoun also said Israel must \"end its successive violations, including the destruction of border villages... which would prevent the return of residents\". Macron's office, in its summary of the conversation, said the French president had called on all parties to the ceasefire to honour their commitments as soon as possible. On January 17, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for Israel to end its military operations and \"occupation\" in the south. The fragile ceasefire has generally held, even as the warring sides have repeatedly traded accusations of violating it. The Israeli military has continued to carry out frequent strikes that it says targeted Hezbollah fighters, and Lebanese state media has reported that Israeli forces were carrying out demolitions in villages they control. The November 27 deal ended two months of full-scale war that had followed months of low-intensity exchanges. Hezbollah began trading cross-border fire with the Israeli army the day after the October 7, 2023 attack\u00a0on Israel by its Palestinian ally Hamas, which triggered the war in Gaza. Israel intensified its campaign against Hezbollah in September, launching a series of devastating blows against the group's leadership and killing its longtime chief Hassan Nasrallah. Hezbollah warned on Thursday that \"any violation of the 60-day deadline will be considered a flagrant violation\" of the ceasefire agreement and \"an infringement on Lebanese sovereignty\". The group refrained from any threat to resume attacks on Israel but said the Lebanese state should use \"all means necessary... to restore the land and wrest it from the clutches of the occupation\".

tariffs Kish Bancorp, Inc. Reports Net Income of $4.1 Million in the Fourth Quarter of 2024 and $14.5 Million for the Year 2024 Business Wire Fri, Jan 17, 2025, 12:00 AM 19 min read In This Article: KISB STATE COLLEGE, Pa., January 16, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Kish Bancorp, Inc. (OTCQX: KISB) (\"Kish\" or the \"Company\"), parent company of Kish Bank, reported net income of $4.1 million, or $1.39 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $4.2 million, or $1.41 per share, for the third quarter of 2024, and $3.5 million, or $1.22 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2024, net income was $14.5 million, an increase of $1.0 million, or 7.6%, compared to $13.5 million for 2023. Earnings per share were $4.92 for the year 2024, compared to $5.22 in 2023. All results are unaudited. Results for the fourth quarter of 2024 benefited from a $142 thousand negative provision. This compared to a $665 thousand provision expense in the third quarter of 2024, and a $575 thousand provision expense in the fourth quarter of 2023. The reversal to the provision for credit losses during the fourth quarter of 2024 was primarily due to a $285 thousand net loan recovery during the quarter, as well as pristine credit quality and improved economic indicators within the Company\u2019s CECL accounting model. \"Kish delivered strong earnings for the fourth quarter and record profits for the year 2024, generated by solid revenue generation and double digit loan and deposit growth,\" stated William P. Hayes, Executive Chairman. \"The increase in net interest income during the fourth quarter compared to the year ago quarter was primarily driven by new loan growth. While the recent Fed rate cuts put some pressure on our net interest margin and our earning assets yields during the quarter, we anticipate improvement in future quarters as our cost of funds adjust downward driven by lower competitive market rates. Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on growing our core deposit franchise by expanding into new markets, capturing market share in our existing markets, and obtaining operational leverage through enhanced technology systems. Our earnings momentum for 2025 is strong, and we have the right team in place to continue to grow and be the best community bank in the markets we serve.\" \"In 2024 we executed several growth initiatives to reach our customers and expand our deposit franchise,\" said Gregory T. Hayes, President and CEO. \"During the spring of 2024 we officially launched ATM + Live Banker, our newest transformative banking solution, at eight locations in Centre, Blair, Huntingdon, and Juniata Counties. ATM + Live Banker is a convenient banking solution that allows customers to perform full-service transactions with a live, local Kish Bank teller via video during expanded hours through our new ATM machines. While other banks are closing branches and eliminating access to people, we are expanding access to our customers. We continue to look for innovative, cost effective ways to reach our customers and grow our business, and ATM + Live Banker is just the start.\" Story Continues Fourth Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights: Total assets increased $149.8 million, or 9.7%, to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to $1.5 billion a year ago.

Also noteworthy, Kish continues to have negligible exposure to loans in nonowner-occupied commercial office space categories.\" Total assets ended the quarter at $1.7 billion, an increase of $149.8 million, or 9.7%, compared to $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2023. Investment securities decreased to $163.1 million, a decrease of $29.5 million from December 31, 2023.

At December 31, 2024, the Company\u2019s tangible book value increased 2.1% to $34.58 per share compared to $33.86 at December 31, 2023. Kish Bank continues to maintain capital levels in excess of the requirements to be categorized as \"well-capitalized\" with a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.02%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 9.92% and a Total capital ratio of 10.62% at December 31, 2024. Operating Results In the fourth quarter of 2024, Kish generated a return on average common equity of 13.56% and a return on average assets of 0.97%, compared to 12.16% and 0.91%, respectively, in the fourth quarter a year ago. For the year, the return on average common equity was 12.23% and return on average assets was 0.89%, compared to 13.02% and 0.94%, respectively, for 2023. Net interest income, before the provision for credit losses, increased 13.3% to $12.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $11.3 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. For the year, net interest income before the provision for credit losses increased $5.4 million, or 12.4% year over year, indicating a well-balanced net interest margin. The resulting relative stability in the net interest margin and managing of interest rate risk is the result of effective balance sheet management strategies, including Kish\u2019s balance sheet hedging program, which creates additional balance sheet flexibility. The Company\u2019s net interest margin was 3.23% in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to 3.30% in the preceding quarter and 3.37% in the fourth quarter of 2023. For the year, the net interest margin was 3.25%, compared to 3.31% in the year-ago period. Primarily due to net loan recoveries, strong credit quality, and improved economic adjustments within the Company\u2019s CECL accounting model, the Company recorded a $142 thousand reversal to its provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter of 2024. This compared to a $665 thousand provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2024, and a $575 thousand provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter of 2023. Fourth quarter noninterest income increased 14.4% to $3.3 million, compared to $2.9 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. Noninterest income for the year increased by 10.1% compared to 2023, led by strong results from Kish\u2019s Wealth Management division, which expanded by $776 thousand to $3.3 million, a 30.5% increase over 2023. Also contributing to noninterest income was gains in sales from the equity portfolio of $392 thousand. These gains were offset to some extent by lower interest rate swap fees, which were impacted by the current level of market interest rates. Noninterest expense increased $1.8 million, or 19.3%, to $11.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $9.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. For the year, noninterest expense increased $4.8 million, or 12.6%, to $42.9 million in 2024, compared to $38.1 million in 2023. Team expansion remains the primary driver of higher salary expense, coupled with inflationary pressures on compensation expense. The increase in operating expenses also reflects the Company\u2019s strategic investment in technology enhancements and the training and education of its employees; all crucial fundamentals in supporting and expanding customer relationships. The efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter of 2024 was 69.3%, compared to 67.9% for the preceding quarter and 69.3% for the fourth quarter of 2023. For the year, the efficiency ratio was 71.0% compared to 70.2% in the year ago period. The efficiency ratio includes the Company\u2019s non-banking units, which operate at higher expense levels than Kish Bank. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company recorded $873 thousand in state and federal income tax expense for an effective tax rate of 17.5%, compared to $702 thousand, or 16.8%, in the fourth quarter a year ago. For the year 2024, the Company recorded $3.0 million in state and federal income tax expense for an effective rate of 17.1%, compared to $2.7 million, or 16.4%, in 2023. Credit Quality The allowance for credit losses represented 1233.52% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2024, compared to 1565.20% a year earlier. Nonperforming loans were $722 thousand, or 0.05% of total loans, at December 31, 2024, compared to $569 thousand, or 0.05% of total loans, a year earlier. Net loan recoveries totaled $262 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $39 thousand in net loan charge-offs in the fourth quarter a year ago.

read In This Article: BCAB BioAtla, Inc. (BCAB) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change. A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years. Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements. As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for BioAtla is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price. Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock. Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for BioAtla imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher. Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>. Story Continues Earnings Estimate Revisions for BioAtla For the fiscal year ending December 2024, this company is expected to earn -$1.46 per share, which is a change of 43.4% from the year-ago reported number. Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for BioAtla. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 19.5%. Bottom Line Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term. You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>> The upgrade of BioAtla to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.
